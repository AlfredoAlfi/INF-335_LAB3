Bush-Quayle Headquarters
   Bends `Buy American' Idea
The campaign's spokeswoman, Victoria Clarke, initially
explained that the import labels were misleading.
   "You can write with pride that we have a Buy American
policy," she said. "Our computers are made in San Jose,
Calif. Our copiers are made in Leesburg, Va. Our fax machines
are made in Plano, Texas."
   Murata Business Systems Inc., which made the campaign's
fax machines, indeed maintains a U.S. headquarters in Plano.
But "we are a Japanese company and everything is made in
Kyoto, Japan," said a Murata distributor in Rockville, Md.
   Likewise, the campaign's Samsung computers may have passed
through San Jose, where Samsung Information Systems maintains
its U.S. headquarters. But the products themselves are "all
Korean," says a Samsung spokesman.
   After checking further and finding that the Samsung
computers were in fact imported, Ms. Clarke said, "We did try
very hard to get American-made PCs, but the ones available
were way out of our price range."
