Business Brief -- Reebok International Ltd.:
   Lawsuits Over Technology
   Of Pump Shoe Are Settled
But Spalding, a unit of ES Holding Co., is expected to
continue selling its AirFlex baseball glove, which uses a
similar inflatable-chamber design that molds the glove to the
wearer's hand. Design Continuum, Boston, which helped design
the Pump, also designed Spalding's glove.
   Reebok, of Stoughton, Mass., filed suit last July against
Design Continuum in state court in Boston for breach of
contract and confidentiality obligations, saying Design
Continuum solicited Spalding while still working with Reebok.
It asked the court for a temporary injunction to prevent
Design Continuum from disclosing the design. But Spalding and
Design Continuum argued that the design used in the ball
glove was a combination of public knowledge and technology
they developed.
