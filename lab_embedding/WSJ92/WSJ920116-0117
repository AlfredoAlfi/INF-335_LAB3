Bridgeport Plans to Drop
   Its Petition of Bankruptcy
Joseph P. Ganim, who was elected mayor in November, said
Bridgeport later this month will withdraw its appeal of a
federal bankrutpcy court decision in August rejecting the
city's petition.
   The bankruptcy court judge ruled Bridgeport failed to
"present persuasive evidence that it will be unable to pay
its debts any time in the future." The judge, in essence,
said a city can be considered insolvent only if it proves it
can't meet its debt obligations in its current fiscal year or
based on an adopted budget for the next fiscal year.
   Former Mayor Mary Moran had argued that as drastic a move
as bankruptcy is, it was better for the city's long-term
future than raising taxes further and slashing badly needed
public services.
   Mayor Ganim said Bridgeport "will make the tough decisions
to close its budget deficit." The gap for the year ending
June 30 is estimated at $20.7 million, up from the $17.6
million estimate when the city filed for protection.
