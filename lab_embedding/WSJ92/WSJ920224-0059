Business Brief -- Nippondenso Co.:
   Group Net in 1991 Fell 11%
   Amid Auto Industry Slump
For the current year, the Tokyo company said it expects
group pretax profit to climb 2.4% to 85 billion yen, with net
profit rising 2.2% to 46.50 billion yen and sales gaining 4%
to 1.4 trillion yen.
   In addition to the decline in revenue, pretax profit was
hurt by a rise in costs for marketing and general management.
The decline in net wasn't as sharp because of sales of stock
in an overseas subsidiary.
   The pretax profit represents operating profit plus
non-operating profit including financial income and expenses.
The net income comprises pretax profit plus extraordinary
gains or losses and payments of taxes.
   Nippondenso, which is closely affiliated with Toyota Motor
Corp., said group sales of car air conditioners came to
472.23 billion yen, a decline of 3.9% from 1990.
