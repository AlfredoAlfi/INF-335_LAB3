Northwest Airlines
   Claims Vindication
   In Report on Midway
Before Midway shut down last November, Northwest said it
couldn't go along with a plan to buy Midway assets and hire
its employees partly because discrepancies in Midway's
operational data made the airline a more costly venture than
Northwest officials had initially believed. Midway officials
had denied any wrongdoing. Midway's court-appointed trustee
didn't return phone calls yesterday.
   The Inspector General's study came at the request of Rep.
James Oberstar (D., Minn.), widely considered to be an ally
of Northwest. Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., is a unit
of NWA Inc., which in turn is a unit of Wings Holdings Inc.
   In a letter to Mr. Oberstar, Ms. Sterling said Midway
underreported to the Transportation Department the number of
passengers it flew in 1990 by about 11%, compared with
figures Midway provided Northwest. She said Midway
overreported its 1990 passenger revenue figures by about 21%,
versus numbers given to Northwest.
   Ms. Sterling blamed the differences on factors including
how Midway processed its data for the Transportation
Department. Ms. Sterling said, however, that "nothing came to
our attention during the course of our review to indicate
that Midway deliberately filed misrepresented sample" data.
