Economy:
   Help-Wanted Ads Remain
   Flat at a Depressed Level
"The labor market has been remarkably stable over the last
six months," said Ken Goldstein, Conference Board economist.
"Help-wanted advertising volume has been virtually flat." He
added that "after 16 straight months of sizable layoffs,
there is no strong evidence that the slump in labor market
activity is beginning to break up."
   Ad volume fell in four of the nine U.S. regions measured
by the indicator. Advertising dropped slightly in the New
England and Mountain regions, while the East North Central
region showed no change. The Middle Atlantic and West North
Central areas rose slightly, while increases in the South
Atlantic and East South Central regions were considerably
higher. Hardest hit were the Pacific and West South Central
regions.
   The nonprofit organization's monthly survey tracks
help-wanted ad volume in 51 major U.S. newspapers as a gauge
of the supply of jobs.
