   Firm Expects to Report
   Profit, Revenue Doubled
Per-share earnings, after taxes but before any items,
totaled about 10 cents compared with 11 cents in the 1990
fourth quarter. The most recent figure, however, is based on
a greater number of average shares outstanding -- 3,397,000
versus 2,249,000 in the 1990 fourth quarter -- because of the
company's recent public offering.
   For all of 1991, earnings totaled about $1.2 million
compared with $711,000 a year earlier, Mr. Youree said.
Revenue rose to about $24 million from $13 million. Pershare
earnings totaled about 45 cents compared with 32 cents --
again, on a higher number of average shares outstanding:
2,669,000 in 1991 and 2,226,000 in 1990.
