New York City Considers
   Issuing Some Bonds in Yen
"It is highly unusual and kind of exciting," said Heather
Ruth, president of the Public Securities Association. "An
enormous issuer like New York City always needs to be
developing new institutional investors for its securities."
   Michael W. Geffrard, director of New York's office of
public finance, said the city has received proposals to sell
yen-denominated bonds from U.S. and Japanese investment
banking firms. "It is something we are considering," he said.
"We are always looking for ways to save money."
   It is rare for a U.S. city or state to sell bonds in
currencies other than the dollar. But major U.S. corporations
and supranational organizations frequently issue debt abroad.
   Last week, the World Bank sold 250 billion yen ($1.88
billion) of bonds, becoming the biggest issuer after the
Japanese government to sell yen bonds. The 10-year yen bonds
were priced to yield 5.35%, more than 2.5 percentage points
lower than it would have had to pay in the U.S. New York
City, which pays rates of about 7% to 7.7% for its longer
term tax-exempt securities, could possibly obtain lower rates
in Japan, too.
