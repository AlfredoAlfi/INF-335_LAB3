Princeton/Newport
   Defendants to Face
   Proceedings by SEC
Last month, federal prosecutors dropped racketeering and
tax charges against six other defendants in the
Princeton/Newport case. Yesterday, Mr. Zarzecki's lawyer
filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The SEC, which typically bars people convicted of criminal
charges from the securities industry, said it would begin
hearings on Messrs. Newberg and Zarzecki.
   Mr. Newberg's lawyer, Fred Hafetz, said he would oppose
the SEC action. "We believe Mr. Newberg has an outstanding
background and has already been punished enough," he said.
Mr. Newberg already has "been out of the industry for about
five years and would like to get back in," the lawyer added.
