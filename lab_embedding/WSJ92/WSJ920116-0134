PGE's Profit Rose
   14% in 4th Quarter;
   Dividend Is Boosted
The increased dividend is payable April 15 to stock of
record March 16. "We are committed to a policy of increasing
dividends for our shareholders when such increases can be
sustained," said Richard A. Clarke, chairman and chief
executive officer of the utility holding company. PGE
boosted the dividend by a like amount a year ago.
   Operating revenue from the company's Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant fell to $392 million from $402 million because of
a scheduled refueling of Unit 2 that ended Oct. 26.
   For the full year, PGE's net income climbed 3.9% to $1.03
billion, or $2.24 a share, from $987.2 million, or $2.10 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 3.2% to $9.78 billion
from $9.47 billion. The 1991 results include an after-tax
charge of $26 million, or six cents a share, from a write-off
of an investment in a magnesium metal production facility by
Alberta Natural Gas Co., which is 49.98%-owned by PGE's
Pacific Gas Transmission Co. Year-earlier results include an
after-tax write-off of $66 million, or 15 cents a share, from
litigation and settlement costs.
   The company's board called for redemption or repurchase of
as much as $1.3 billion of mortgage bonds to reduce financing
costs. Dates for the redemptions haven't been determined.
PGE said refunding the bonds could provide average annual
savings to the company of $8.5 million and total savings of
as much as $174.8 million.
   Separately, the company named Jack F. Jenkins-Stark, its
treasurer, to the additional post of vice president.
