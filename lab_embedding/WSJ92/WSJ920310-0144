Pepper...and Salt
Doctors and lawyers advertise
   Their services and fees;
   Podiatrists and dentists, too,
   Headline their expertise.
   I study each of these daily,
   Avidly and without fail,
   Since I intend to go
   Once there is a sale.

   Paper Chaste
                                                                                                       

   We all peruse the news,
   But do we really need it?
   One freedom of the press
   Is the freedom not to read it.
   -- Ruth Boorstin.
