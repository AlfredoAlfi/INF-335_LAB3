Caterpillar, UAW Resume
   Talks on New Pact Today
About 2,400 of the 16,000 UAW workers at Caterpillar hit
the company with a limited strike in early November, and the
construction-equipment concern responded by locking out 5,600
other workers.
   When Caterpillar disclosed more than a week ago that it
wanted to resume talks and present the union with a modified
proposal, it said it would call the locked-out workers back
to work this past Sunday.
   As UAW leaders recently promised, however, the locked-out
workers joined the strike over the weekend instead of
accepting the invitation to return.
