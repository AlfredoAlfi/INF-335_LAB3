Piper Jaffray Files
   For Two Holders' Sale
   Of Total 26% Stake
The trust holds the common shares formerly held by H.C.
Piper, former chairman and chief executive officer of Piper
Jaffray, who died in August 1990.
   ITT Hartford, an ITT Corp. unit, is selling its shares
because it believes that its Piper Jaffray holdings "are no
longer consistent with its long-term business strategy,"
Piper said.
   Piper Jaffray shares, like those of other brokerage
concerns, have enjoyed a spectacular upturn as the market
strengthened, particularly in recent months. Piper shares
fell $1.125 in national over-the-counter trading Friday, to
close at $29.375.
   The executors of the Harry C. Piper Estate Trust, Piper
Jaffray said, "have recommended the sale of a significant
portion of the shares held by the estate in order to
diversify the assets of the charitable trust." Terms of the
trust dictate that all shares held by the estate be
distributed to a charitable trust administered by the
Minneapolis Foundation, a community foundation.
   Piper Jaffray unit Piper, Jaffray  Hopwood Inc. and
Morgan Stanley  Co., a unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.,
will underwrite the offering.
