Business Brief:
   Southern Co. Unit
   Won't Offer New Bids
   For Portugal Project
Government officials in Portugal first sought bids for the
coal-fired plant in Pego in June 1991. But according to
Southern Co., those officials are now asking original bidders
for new or modified proposals.
   Southern Co., a utility holding company, said yesterday
that while the controversy surrounding its original bid was a
"factor" in its decision not to make a new bid, the primary
reason lies with other business opportunities.
   For instance, Southern Co. said Southern Electric was
selected in November as one of two finalists to bid on a
large coalfired generating plant near Melbourne, Australia.
And this month, the subsidiary was selected by the Slovak
Power Enterprise to study the overhaul of a
1,320,000-kilowatt coal-fired station in eastern
Czechoslovakia.
