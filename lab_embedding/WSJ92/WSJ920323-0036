Business Brief -- Northeast Utilities:
   State Regulators Clear Plan
   To Buy PS New Hampshire
A Northeast spokesman said that the acquisition still
requires clearance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but
that Northeast hopes to complete the transaction "in
mid-Spring."
   Northeast's acquisition of PS New Hampshire is a major
part of the Manchester, N.H., utility's bankruptcy
reorganization plan brought on by the huge cost and slow
construction of the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Northeast closed at $23.875, up 37.5 cents.
