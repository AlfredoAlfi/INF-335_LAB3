Business Brief -- Society Corp.:
   Acquisition of Ameritrust
   For $1.4 Billion Completed
In response to the acquisition, Moody's Investors Service
raised Ameritrust's credit ratings, including an upgrade of
Ameritrust senior debt to single-A-3 from Baa-3. Society will
assume all senior and subordinated debt issued by Ameritrust.
Moody's confirmed Society's senior obligations rating of
single-A-3 and also upheld the ratings of Society units. But
Standard  Poor's downgraded Society senior debt to
single-A-minus from single-A.
   Under terms of the $1.4 billion acquisition, Ameritrust
common shareholders will receive 0.65 common share of Society
for each Ameritrust share. Ameritrust preferred stock will be
exchanged for a new issue of Society preferred stock.
