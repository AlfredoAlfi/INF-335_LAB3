Inamed Unit Sues FDA
   Over `Prejudging' Implants
McGhan, an Inamed Corp. unit based in Santa Barbara,
Calif., charged that several members of the advisory panel
have shown bias against silicone implants. The panel is
scheduled to meet next week for three days of hearings and
deliberations on the future of silicone implants.
   The company asked the court to instruct Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to take over the regulatory
matter. "We could support the creation of a blue-ribbon
panel" under the auspices of the National Institutes of
Health, said Jan Varner, McGhan president.
   U.S. District Court Judge John Hargrove will hear
arguments today on whether to impose a temporary restraining
order against the FDA.
