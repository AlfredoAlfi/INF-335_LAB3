   Eisner to Post of Chief
Island World, a unit of Amsterdam's Island World B.V., is
well-capitalized at a time when film financing is scarce. It
was formed in Feb. 1990 in a merger of Chris Blackwell's
Island Pictures and John Heyman's World Film Services Inc.
   Island World has access to $150 million from a consortium
of banks, with another $200 million expected to become
available soon, according to individuals close to the
company. The company, which has cash flow from an overseas TV
distribution operation and other units, has produced films
including "Toy Soldiers" and "Strictly Business," both of
which had disappointing openings. The operation had been
decentralized, its film production split among offices in
London, Los Angeles, and New York. Operations now will be
centralized under Mr. Eisner.
   While at Geffen, Mr. Eisner was involved in producing
films including "Risky Business," "Beetlejuice" and the
current "The Last Boy Scout." He will also become a partner
in Island World with the two co-founders, and a director of
the parent company.
