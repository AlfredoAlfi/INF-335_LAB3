Credit Ratings:
   Moody's Downgrades
   USAir Group Debt
   And Preferred Stock
Moody's said it lowered the company's USAir Inc.
subsidiary's equipment trust certificates and pass-through
certificates to Ba-2 from Baa-3, senior debentures and
industrial revenue bonds to Ba-3 from Ba1, and a shelf
registration to (P)Ba-3 from (P)Ba-1. Piedmont Aviation
Inc.'s equipment trust certificates were lowered to Ba-2 from
Baa-3, and industrial revenue bonds to Ba-3 from Ba-1. Also,
the parent company's convertible preferred stock has been
lowered to single-B-3 from single-B1.
   "USAir's cash flow is currently constrained," Moody's
said, and coverage of fixed charges, including dividends on
preferred stock, diminished. Moody's said that
credit-protection measurements are expected to decline
further given its expectation for continuing soft economic
conditions in many eastern markets served by the USAir
franchise. "Reliance on these markets increases USAir's
vulnerability to lingering soft travel demand and aggravates
its disadvantage to higher-rated competitor airlines which
are much larger in scope and financially stronger."
   USAir couldn't be reached for comment.
