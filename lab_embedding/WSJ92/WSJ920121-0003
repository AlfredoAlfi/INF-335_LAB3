Business Brief -- Corning Inc.:
   Net Income Advances 15%,
   Despite $8.2 Million Charge
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Corning fell $4.75 to $65.25.
   The results were led by sales gains in its laboratory
services segment and in its optical fiber and cable business.
   Corning posted nonoperating gains of $8.3 million,
including a $5.3 million gain on the sale of less than a 10%
interest in Corning Japan K.K. to Japanese investors.
Yesterday, Corning announced the completion of that sale.
   Offsetting those gains was the $8.2 million charge that
reflects Corning's share of a previously announced
fourth-quarter charge of $25 million by Dow Corning Corp. Dow
Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and Corning,
last week halted sales of its breast implants after the Food
and Drug Administration called for a moratorium on the use of
implants containing silicone gel, saying there isn't enough
evidence to prove their safety.
