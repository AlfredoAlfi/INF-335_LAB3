Mirror Group Will Close
   Racing Times Newspaper
Mirror Group, once controlled by Mr. Maxwell, had tried to
sell the unprofitable paper but couldn't find a buyer. The
company said the Racing Times, a feisty upstart that
challenged the established Racing Form, will publish its last
issue today.
   Mirror Group said the shutdown is a result of losses at
the Racing Times and "Mirror Group's changed circumstances
revealed since Mr. Maxwell's death." Mirror Group is under
pressure following revelations that Mr. Maxwell looted his
public companies.
   The paper's circulation never surpassed the 15,000 level
and Mr. Maxwell projected that a daily circulation of 30,000
was the break-even point.
   The New York state Attorney General's office said it was
reviewing the attempts to sell the Racing Times. "We want to
figure out whether it violated the law," said George Sampson,
assistant attorney general and chief of the antitrust bureau.
   Charles Wilson, a Mirror Group director, said the Racing
Times had been up for sale for three months, and that while
more than 20 parties showed interest, no offers were
received. "We are confident there was no violation of
antitrust law," Mr. Wilson said.
