   Apple Can't Meet Demand
   For a Notebook Computer
Analysts estimate that Apple sold 120,000 notebook
computers in the last three months of the year, and Mr.
Sculley said that this year Apple is the top supplier of
notebook computers in the U.S., selling more than traditional
leaders Toshiba Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
   Separately, Mr. Sculley said that, along with partners
International Business Machines Corp. and Motorola Inc.,
Apple expects to spend $1 billion "over the next few years"
on four separate reduced-instruction-set-computing
microprocessors. He said IBM is putting up most of the money.
   The alliance involving the three companies is closely
watched because it may change the balance of power in
microprocessors, a lucrative industry.
