Technology Brief -- Athena Neurosciences Inc.:
   Rat Experiments Might Aid
   Multiple Sclerosis Treatment
"The results strongly support our belief that the
neurological damage associated with brain inflammation in MS
can be prevented by blocking white blood cell migration,"
said Lawrence C. Fritz, Athena's vice president of research.
The company, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif.,
said an antibody prevented development of paralysis in about
70% of the treated rats, and delayed and reduced the degree
of paralysis in the other cases.
   The results were reported in a paper published in the
British journal Nature.
