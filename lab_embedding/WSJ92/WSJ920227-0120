Top Telephone Firms
   In Japan Hold Talks
   On Overseas Venture
A spokesman for KDD, Japan's overseas telecommunications
provider, said the two companies were meeting, but were far
from drafting any specific plans.
   A spokeswoman for NTT, the domestic telephone giant,
denied that the two were planning to set up a company, but
couldn't comment on whether any meetings were taking place.
   NTT has mainly focused on the Japanese market, but
following its 1985 deregulation has tried to secure more
business overseas. It is currently seeking contracts in
Brazil and Indonesia.
