Marketing  Media:
   Mattel and Nickelodeon
   Team Up for a Toy Line
The agreement furthers the toy maker's strategy of
breaking into new product categories to better balance its
mix. The activity-toys category, which accounts for about 15%
of total domestic toy volume, is a catch-all that includes
building toys, modeling compounds, outdoor games and other
amusements.
   Geraldine Laybourne, Nickelodeon's president, said the
toys will initially be sold under the broad Nickelodeon
umbrella, instead of being tied directly to specific
characters or shows. The idea is to position toys under a
brand image instead of simply trying to capitalize on
whatever is popular at the moment, and to give the cable
operator some flexibility in future licensing deals.
   Nickelodeon has other licensing agreements for apparel,
outdoor equipment and other merchandise, and it may expand
its toy pact to include items from some of its popular shows,
such as "Eureeka's Castle."
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Mattel
rose 50 cents to $31.50.
