Seven Companies Quit
   Fannie Mae Group
Since the summer, Fannie Mae's debenture selling group has
dropped to 49 members from 56 members, said Franklin Raines,
Fannie Mae vice chairman.
   Fannie Mae recently established a selling group agreement
to make it clear that it can impose "reasonable" fines on
members that commit "significant" breaches in the agreement
terms.
   Mr. Raines said four institutions -- Southeast Banks,
Miami; Central Fidelity Bank, Lynchburg, Va.; Northern Trust
Securities Inc., Chicago; and BT Securities Corp., New York
-- dropped out of the selling group late last year before
members were offered new selling group agreements.
   Three other institutions recently informed Fannie Mae that
they had concluded the business was unprofitable and were
leaving the group. They are First Fidelity Bank, Newark,
N.J.; South Carolina National Bank, Columbia, S.C.; and
J.J.B. Hilliard, W.L. Lyons Inc., Louisville, Ky.
