Business Brief -- Nevada Power Co.:
   Utility Seeks to Raise Rates
   By $38.6 Million in 30 Days
Nevada Power, based in Las Vegas, said the increase would
allow it to set general rates based on a test period of Nov.
1, 1990, to Oct. 31, 1991, with an additional four-month
certification through Feb. 29, 1992. During the test period,
the utility added 20,000 new customers and spent more than
$148 million on new construction to provide service.
   In November, state regulators granted Nevada Power a $22
million rate increase, or 40% of the $37.2 million increase
it had initially sought. The utility said the
smaller-than-expected increase, the first since 1983, would
lead to a $5 million charge against fourth-quarter earnings.
