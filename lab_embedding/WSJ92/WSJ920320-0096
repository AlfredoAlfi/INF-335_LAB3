Business Brief -- UJB Financial Corp.:
   Dissidents Start Proxy Fight
   To Force a Sale or Merger
The group is seeking to elect five nominees to UJB's
13-member board, limit executive compensation, eliminate all
"golden parachute" severance agreements, and limit the number
of UJB executives on the board to one.
   In a letter to UJB shareholders, Mr. Weisman criticized
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer T. Joseph Semrod's
"lucrative" compensation package, which Mr. Weisman claims
includes $728,000 in salary and $1.6 million of stock and
options.
   He criticized the board's decision to cut dividends nearly
50% in 1990, and charged management with using "entrenchment
tactics" such as the adoption of a "poison pill"
shareholder-rights plan and the "golden parachute"
agreements.
