Business Brief -- Willcox  Gibbs Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Loss Posted
   And Dividend Is Suspended
The maker of yarns and distributor of electrical supplies
posted a quarterly loss of $2.7 million, or 20 cents a share,
virtually the same as its loss in the year-earlier quarter.
Sales rose 5.6% to $152.8 million, from $144.8 million in the
year-earlier period.
   The company suspended its five-cent semiannual cash
dividend "until we see some improvement in the economy," said
Richard Mackey, the company's president. Based on current
trading prices for Willcox shares, the suspension would save
the company roughly $10 million a year. Mr. Mackey said the
dividend could possibly be restored later this year.
