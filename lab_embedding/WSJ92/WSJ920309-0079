American Contractor
   Plans to Hire Russians
   For Fusion Research
The Russian fusion scientists are being hired on a
one-year contract, officials said. The agreement was struck
between the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow
and General Atomics, a private California company that
receives funding under Energy Department contract, the
department said. The arrangement then was approved by U.S.
government agencies.
   Officials said other Energy Department contractors that do
fusion research may follow suit eventually.
   The fusion process produces energy by joining atoms, while
the nuclear fission process used in nuclear energy reactors
and nuclear weapons makes energy by breaking apart atoms.
