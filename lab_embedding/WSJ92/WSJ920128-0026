Marketing  Media:
   Head of Hachette, Matra
   Weighs How to Merge Both
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
At this stage, Mr. Lagardere said, "we've created
coordinating structures between Matra and Hachette which are
beneficial, but they are insufficient, especially since
Hachette, after its reorganization, has moved onto its
international development."
   "Today," he added, "I'm considering integrated financial
structures that would allow the unification of the entire
group without weakening control."
   Mr. Lagardere, through his holding company MMB S.A.,
controls 24.6% of Matra. MMB also is the principal
shareholder in Societe Marlis, a holding company that owns
51.6% of Hachette.
