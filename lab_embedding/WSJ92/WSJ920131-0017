Dreyer's Indicates Net
   Rose in Fourth Quarter
Mr. Cronk said revenue for the quarter was "slightly
better than expected," boosted by the introduction of a
sugar-free ice cream and the expanded distribution of its
products throughout the Northeast and Cleveland areas.
   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Dreyer's earned $1.5
million, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $68.5 million.
   Sales on the West Coast are strongest, he said, but sales
in the East and Midwest are the fastest-growing. Mr. Cronk
said the company has been pursuing a plan of expanding from
the New York metropolitan area throughout the Northeast, and
from Washington, D.C., and Virginia toward the South.
Dreyer's goal, he said, is to increase revenue by 25%
annually.
   Two weeks ago, the company began selling ice cream in
south Florida, he said. In February, Dreyer's will begin its
most extensive advertising campaign ever in most of its major
markets, timed to start with the opening of the winter
Olympic games.
   In Japan, Dreyer's began this month earning a profit for
the first time since beginning a joint venture in 1990 with
Nissho Iwai, a Japanese trading company, Mr. Cronk said.
