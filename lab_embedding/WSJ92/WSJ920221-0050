   On Arbitration Committee
The NASD committee oversees the securities arbitration
process and suggests rules and procedures to improve the
system. Recently, for instance, the NASD proposed expanding
the power of its arbitrators through a rule that would grant
arbitrators the power to issue injunctions in disputes
involving brokerage firms.
   Mr. Page also is a member of the American Arbitration
Association's securities arbitration rules task force and is
a director of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar
Association.
   Other members of the NASD committee include Theodore
Krebsbach, litigation director at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. The committee's chairman is Irving Pollack, a former
Securities and Exchange Commission regulator and currently a
securities-industry consultant.
