U.S. Raises Estimate
   Of Orange Crop 2%
   From Last Month
Florida orange production was pegged at 139 million boxes,
up 2% from Jan 1., while California orange production was put
at 60 million boxes, unchanged from last month.
   The total citrus crop was projected at 11.7 million tons,
up slightly from last month and up 6% from last season, with
overall citrus quality described as good.
   The department estimated grapefruit production, including
California's desert grapefruit, at 1.97 million tons, down 6%
from last year. The decrease is due to a smaller Florida
crop.
   The department said its forecast for wheat stocks on June
1 remains unchanged at 390 million bushels, as expectations
of larger exports offset anticipated lower feed use. The
nation's corn stocks were projected at 1.09 billion bushels
on Sept. 1, 15 million bushels higher than last month's
estimate.
