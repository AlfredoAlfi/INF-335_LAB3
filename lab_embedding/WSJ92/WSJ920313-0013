   Control of Greece's
   Largest Cement Firm

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Ferruzzi said Calcestruzzi's initial investment would be
411 billion lire. This amount would drop to 335 billion lire
following the placement of the shares not transferred to the
new joint venture company, Ferruzzi said.
   Calcestruzzi, a leading Italian cement company, said the
acquisition lays the groundwork for its expansion in the
Mediterranean and elsewhere in Europe.
   U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley International in
London, which represented the Greek government in the sale,
said the operation "represents the largest sale in Greek
history and is a major step in the government's privatization
program." Morgan Stanley said the price Calcestruzzi paid for
the Heracles stake puts the value of the Greek company at
$927 million.
   Heracles, which is government controlled but has shares on
the Athens stock exchange, had 1991 pretax profit of $36
million on revenue of $400 million.
