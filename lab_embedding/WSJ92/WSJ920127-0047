Technology Brief -- Compaq Computer Corp.:
   Lighter Notebook Computer
   Expected to Be Launched
The state-of-the-art machines don't come cheap: The most
powerful model, which stores up to 120 megabytes of
information on the disk-drive and operates at 25 megahertz,
has a suggested retail price of $4,699.
   But, in a nod to Compaq's effort to become more
cost-competitive, the company also is offering a
stripped-down model that stores just 40 megabytes of
information for $2,899.
