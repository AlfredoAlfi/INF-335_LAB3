Business Brief -- Delta Air Lines:
   Carrier Reviews Operations
   With Goal of Cutting Costs
While it would be easiest to rearrange its options on new
aircraft, the Delta spokesman said the airline hasn't decided
if it needs to adjust its fleet plan. The carrier is looking
to shave costs in a number of different areas but furloughs
are unlikely. Delta has never laid off employees.
