Business Brief -- Consolidated Freightways Inc.:
   Connecticut Investor Seeks
   To Launch a Proxy Fight
Consolidated, Palo Alto, Calif., said it rejected a recent
offer by Mr. Young to buy its Emery Worldwide air freight
unit, which it bought in 1989 and has proved to be a
loss-ridden acquisition.
   Mr. Young said in an interview that he owns just ten
shares of Consolidated's stock, has not yet made any filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has not
hired a proxy solicitation firm or a law firm to represent
him. But he said the $2 million or more necessary to wage the
proxy fight "is available from private sources," which he
declined to identify.
