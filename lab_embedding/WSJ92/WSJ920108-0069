Former Employee
   Of Bank Hapoalim
   Enters Guilty Plea
Between 1987 and 1989, Mr. Rose, of Sudbury, Mass.,
allegedly procured numerous loans for Edward Desmond, a
co-defendant in the case, and Mr. Desmond's company, Carlyle
Omni Industries Inc.
   In one instance, Mr. Rose allegedly authorized the closing
of a $6 million loan for Mr. Desmond without requiring him to
post real estate collateral. Bank Hapoalim later had a $5
million loss as a result.
