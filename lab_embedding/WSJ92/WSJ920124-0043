Business Brief -- Universal Health Services Inc.:
   Quarterly Net Is Expected
   To Meet Analysts' Estimates
In the year-earlier quarter, Universal Health, based in
King of Prussia, Pa., reported net of $1.1 million, or eight
cents a share, on revenue of $159 million.
   For the year, Mr. Miller said he expects to report net
income of $19.5 million to $20 million, or $1.45 a share,
also in line with expectations. Revenue should be about $680
million to $690 million. For 1990, revenue was $627.1
million. The 1991 full-year results include a net gain of 20
cents a share after the sale of some British hospitals and
closure of a Texas hospital. Also, per-share figures are
adjusted to reflect assumed conversion of Universal Health
debentures.
   "We've had five years of year-to-year gains" with the 1991
results, which the company will be reporting in a few weeks,
Mr. Miller said.
