International:
   British Aerospace
   Wins EC Court Fight
   Over Aid From U.K.
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The EC's executive body treated the "sweeteners" as an
adjunct to an earlier aid package that it cleared. But it
should have opened a new inquiry into the additional aid, the
court said.
   In 1988, the Commission cleared a British aid package of
debt reductions and write-offs to help British Aerospace take
over Rover. Subsequent to that approval, about #44 million
($79 million at the current exchange rate) in so-called
sweeteners were uncovered. The Commission ruled that the
money was additional aid that must be recovered by the U.K.
   But the court ruled Tuesday that the Commission was wrong
to treat the sweeteners as an adjunct to the original aid
inquiry, particularly as it didn't give Rover and British
Aerospace a chance to put forward their side of the case. It
should have opened a new inquiry, it said.
   The Commission said it would study the ruling.
