Business Brief -- Southwestern Bell Corp.:
   Firm's Phone Unit Agrees
   To Early Retirement Plan
CWA spokesman Jennings Wooldridge said that as many as
1,800 employees will be offered early retirement incentives
and that 1,200 to 1,500 will likely accept the offer. For the
most part, he said, the early retirement packages will be
offered to clerical workers or service representatives.
   The company said the jobs have become surplus because of
consolidations, reductions in its management ranks and
greater efficiencies from new technology.
