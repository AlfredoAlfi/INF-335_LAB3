Business Brief -- American Medical Holdings Inc.:
   Earnings of $155,000 Posted
   For Firm's Fiscal 1st Period
In the past year, American Medical has sold a number of
facilities and refinanced its debt. Adjusted for the asset
sales and refinancing, American Medical said it had pro-forma
first quarter net income of $649,000, or three cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $15.3 million, or 20 cents a
share, the year before. Pro-forma revenue was $537.8 million,
up 7.7% from pro-forma revenue of $499.2 million for the
first quarter of fiscal 1991.
   The gain in the quarter reflects the sale of $96 million
face amount zero-coupon notes of Epic Healthcare Group Inc.
due 2001 for $23.5 million. Epic was created by an American
Medical-sponsored employee stock ownership plan in 1988. The
company also posted an extraordinary charge from repurchasing
some of its debt.
