Business Brief -- UNC Inc.:
   Agency Orders Firm to Use
   Funds to Clean Mill Site
UNC noted that the mill, which had been operated by its
United Nuclear Corp. subsidiary, closed in 1982. It also said
that the remediation effort at the site, near Gallup, N.M.,
had been fully provided for at the time. Dan A. Colussy,
president of UNC, said the company has spent $30 million
already and should spend $8 million or $9 million more to
complete the work.
   As previously reported, the United Nuclear unit this week
received $67.5 million in settlement of an unrelated case
with the federal government for the taking of UNC uranium
leases.

   UNC Inc. was ordered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
to set aside $16.4 million in escrow for the cleanup of a
former uranium mill site, pending other surety bonding
arrangements for the cleanup by the company. The NRC's order
was incorrectly characterized in Friday's edition.
