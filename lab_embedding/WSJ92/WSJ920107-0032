Famous Japanese Gambler
   Is Stabbed to Death at Home
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Mr. Kashiwagi, who was the subject of a Page One story in
this newspaper in June 1990, had recently been trying to
renegotiate the amount of his debt and arrange a return trip
to the site of his losses, The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino,
said Mr. Gomes.
   "He was an enormous player," said Mr. Gomes. Mr.
Kashiwagi, 54 years old, was known for gambling for up to 14
hours at a stretch and betting as much as $14 million an hour
at baccarat, a card game.
   Mr. Kashiwagi had brushed aside a previous request from
this newspaper for details about his income. He claimed $1
billion in assets and income of about $100 million a year. He
described his company, Kashiwagi Shoji Co., as a real estate
and investment concern.
