   Hoffmann-La Roche Halts
   Comparison of AIDS Drugs
Of the 320 people who took DDC, 59 died, compared with 33
of the 315 who took AZT, he said.
   Hoffmann, a unit of Roche Holding Ltd., stopped the
comparison study in late December, a year earlier than
planned. The study involved people with AIDS who had not used
AZT in the past or had been on it for less than three months.
   The spokesman said DDC is still being studied to see how
effective it would be for people who find AZT intolerable or
if it were used along with AZT. Hoffmann has applied to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market the drug for
those purposes.
