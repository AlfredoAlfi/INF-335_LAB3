Marketing  Media:
   Executive Pay Critic Loses
   Another Magazine Post
On Monday, Mr. Crystal was dropped as a columnist from
Financial World. His last column, on compensation at General
Dynamics Corp., was written before this decision, and appears
in an issue appearing this week.
   In June, after four years helping prepare Fortune
magazine's list of highest-paid executives, Mr. Crystal
resigned, citing interference from officials at parent Time
Warner Inc.
   Douglas A. McIntyre, president of Financial World,
insisted that executive furor over Crystal's pay calculations
in a large survey on executive pay, rather than advertiser
pressure, was behind the decision. Mr. McIntyre cited
especially an error which caused Mr. Crystal to overstate a
portion of the compensation of Phelps Dodge Inc. Chairman
Douglas C. Yearley by a factor of 10. Mr. Crystal says he
acknowledged, and apologized for, the error. Critics seized
on that error to question the entire survey, Mr. McIntyre
said.
