American Travellers
   Faces Suits Concerning
   Earnings Restatements
The company last week said it was restating its 1991
second-quarter earnings to $2.6 million, or 25 cents a share,
from $3.4 million, or 33 cents a share, and third-quarter
earnings to $2.9 million, or 28 cents a share, from $3.6
million, or 35 cents a share. It said the revisions were
necessary "to correct errors in recording certain expenses
and acquisitions completed in 1991." It also reported flat
fourth quarter earnings of $3.1 million, or 30 cents a share,
for the fourth quarter, on $38 million in revenue.
   American Travellers said the complaints allege the company
misstated or omitted material facts affecting its financial
condition and future prospects, but in a statement it denied
any wrongdoing and intends to defended the restatements.
