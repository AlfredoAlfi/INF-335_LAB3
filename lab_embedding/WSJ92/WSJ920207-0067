Dividend News:
   Tyco Toys Declares
   Stock Split, Payout
Richard E. Grey, chairman and president, said the
dividend, payable March 10 to stock of record March 1,
reflects the board's confidence in the "long-term prospects
of the company."
   Tyco stock was quoted at $36.75 a share, down 37.5 cents,
in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
   The company is expected to report net income of 50 to 55
cents a share, on sales of $160 million to $170 million, for
the 1991 fourth quarter, said John Taylor, an L.H. Alton 
Co. analyst. In the 1990 fourth quarter, Tyco posted a loss
of $9.7 million, after charges for restructuring costs and
uncollectible accounts, on sales of $118 million in the
year-earlier period.
   Several toys made by Tyco, including its Little Mermaid
doll and two drawing toys, Magna Doodle and Magic Copier,
were hot sellers last year. The company's radio-control cars,
planes and boats also were strong sellers.
   For all of 1991, Mr. Taylor estimates that Tyco will post
net of $1.85 to $1.90 a share, after a one-time charge of 30
cents a share, on sales of $530 million to $540 million. In
1990, the company had net of $3.4 million, or 50 cents a
share, after various charges, on sales of $461.2 million.
