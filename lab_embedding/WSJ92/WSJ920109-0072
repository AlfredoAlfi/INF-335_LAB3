Business Brief -- Compass Holdings Ltd.:
   Rescue Proposal Is Offered
   By Provisional Liquidator
Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator and a senior
partner at insolvency and accountancy firm Ferrier Hodgson,
told journalists there is more than a 50% chance of finding a
new major shareholder for Compass.
   But he said if a new major shareholder isn't found, the
airline won't survive. As many as 30 parties, including
airlines and institutions, have approached Ferrier to take
part in a reconstruction of Compass.
