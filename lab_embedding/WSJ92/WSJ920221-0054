Business Brief -- Mannesmann AG:
   German Firm Says Net Fell
   In 1991 Despite Sales Rise
Mannesmann attributed its lower earnings to the slowing
world economy in 1991 and to its rising investment costs. The
group has had to absorb high development expenses for its
D2-Mobilfunk mobile telephone network.
   Mannesmann earlier reported a 27% decline in earnings for
the first six months of 1991. In November, it reported a
"double-digit" decline in earnings for the first three
quarters, and predicted lower full-year earnings as well.
   The group said losses were suffered mainly by its
Mannesmann Rexroth G.m.b.H. unit because of sagging demand
for mechanical engineering world-wide, and by its extensive
operations in Brazil, which are hurt by the recession there.
