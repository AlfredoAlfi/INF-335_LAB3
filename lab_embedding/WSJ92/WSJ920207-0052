Business Brief -- Oxford Capital Securities Inc.:
   Concern's Assets Are Frozen
   By Order of Federal Judge
Oxford is a New York broker-dealer with approximately 50
registered representatives. In November it was suspended from
membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers,
the over-thecounter market's self-regulatory body, for
alleged poor record keeping.
   A lawyer for the SEC said a criminal investigation into
Oxford is continuing.
   Noah Lipman, Oxford Capital's attorney, said the company
denied the allegations in the SEC complaint. He also said
Oxford wanted to "work with the SEC to return funds to anyone
who desires payment."
