Pacific Telesis to Post
   4th-Quarter Charge
   Totaling $120 Million
The charge reflects costs of a job-reduction plan Pacific
Telesis announced two years ago. At the time, it said it
expected to reduce 11,000 jobs through 1994. The charge
includes the cost of severance programs offered in the last
two months, as well as downsizing costs over the next three
years, the company said.
   As of Dec. 30, when the 1991 severance program ended,
about 4,300 managers had accepted the offer. To date, about
6,500 have accepted, the company said.
   A year earlier, Pacific Telesis earned $196 million, or 50
cents a share, including a reserve adjustment that cut net by
$71.5 million, or 18 cents a share. Most of that adjustment
reflected the sale of real estate. Revenue was $2.44 billion.
The current charge of $120 million equals about 30 cents a
share, Pacific Telesis said.
   The company said that since the 1984 breakup of the Bell
system, its main Pacific Bell Telephone unit has eliminated
17,000 jobs, while new access lines have grown by 3.5
million. But the Bells' growth in access lines -- new phone
lines to customers -- slowed last year as recession hurt
demand.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pacific
Telesis fell 75 cents a share, to $44.25.
