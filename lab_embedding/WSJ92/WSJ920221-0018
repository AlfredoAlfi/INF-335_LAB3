Bush Aides Holding
   Session to Formulate
   Attack on Buchanan
The advisers will also be reviewing the president's
domestic proposals to decide whether refinements are
necessary or whether they should highlight certain proposals.
   Mr. Bush himself signaled the change in tactics this week
when he told reporters that "all I did was lay back and get
hammered by these Democrats and, to some degree, by Pat. And
so it's a new ball game. And we're coming out strong." But he
insisted that "the gloves are still on." Those comments came
the day after Mr. Bush's smaller-than-expected win -- 53%-37%
-- in Tuesday's primary, which followed a Buchanan campaign
that focused on Mr. Bush's alleged insensitivity to voters'
economic pain.
   The meeting tomorrow will be dominated by top policy
officials including Chief of Staff Samuel Skinner and new
domestic policy adviser Clayton Yeutter, and will be attended
by campaign adviser Robert Teeter and other key officials.
   Among the ideas being debated is whether to focus more on
the personal exemption increase proposed last month by Mr.
Bush as part of an economic stimulus package. The proposal
was omitted in the first set of legislation President Bush
sent to the Congress.
