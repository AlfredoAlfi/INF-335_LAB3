Business Brief -- Bell Atlantic Corp.:
   Retiree Benefit Charge Set
   For First Quarter of 1991
Because most companies now deduct those benefits from
reported profits as they are paid, they must take a catch-up
charge when they switch to the new standard.
   The new accounting rule requires companies to accrue, or
set up a reserve for, retirees' health benefits by 1993. The
charge can be taken all at once or stretched out over 20
years.
   Investors have already allowed for these one-time items in
their valuation of Bell Atlantic shares. They closed
unchanged yesterday at $47.25 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   The company earlier reported that its 19-cent-a-share gain
on its portion of Telecom Corp. of New Zealand, a temporary
investment sold last year, will be more than offset by other
one-time charges in the fourth quarter.
