Citicorp Makes Forecast
   Of Commercial-Loan Losses
Citicorp also disclosed that its consumer loan delinquency
ratio rose to 4.8% of its consumer loan portfolio in 1991, up
from 3.9% in 1990. Past-due mortgages rose to 5.3% of the
portfolio, up from 4%. While Citicorp has reported a sharp
drop in consumer profits for the year, it hadn't previously
specified its losses in the consumer portfolio. The bank said
"adverse economic conditions, particularly in the U.S.,"
could result in further increases in consumer loan
delinquencies.
