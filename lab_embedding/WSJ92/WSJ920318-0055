International Brief -- Nippon Telegraph  Telephone:
   Executive Reduces Forecast
   Of Profit in Coming Year
About 20 billion yen to 30 billion yen of that decrease
will come from the pending spinoff of the Japanese telephone
giant's mobile-telecommunications unit, while the rest will
stem from economic factors, Mr. Kojima said. The company has
been hurt by intensifying competition in the recently
deregulated market, as well as by the continuing weak
Japanese economy. NTT's fragile financial condition "is made
of bamboo and paper," Mr. Kojima said.
   While NTT is facing financial pressures, analysts say Mr.
Kojima tends to overstate the company's problems, as he tries
to persuade regulators to give the partially privatized
company more flexibility, particularly in raising certain
rates. Indeed, Mr. Kojima said NTT wasn't planning to scale
back its record capital spending plans.
   In a business plan submitted to the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications just last month, NTT forecast profit in
the next fiscal year of 351 billion yen. Mr. Kojima said NTT
probably would formally submit the more pessimistic outlook
in May.
