Hong Kong Bond Offering Set
The initial sale of HK$500 million of bonds was heavily
oversubscribed, but Davy Kwan, first vice president at
International Bank of Asia, said the fresh bonds aren't
likely to do much to improve persistent sluggish trading of
the instruments in the secondary market.
   The government has said in the past that if the two-year
auctions are successful, it will consider introducing
three-year and five-year bonds.
