W.W. Grainger Acquisition
Grainger, a distributor of commercial and industrial
products, said the acquisition marks its entry into direct
marketing. A Grainger spokesman said Lab Safety fits well
with its own specialty products business, which includes
safety products, general industrial, sanitary supplies and
replacement parts markets. In 1991, that business contributed
$213 million of Grainger's $2.1 billion in sales.
   Closing is subject to approval by Grainger's board, among
other things.
