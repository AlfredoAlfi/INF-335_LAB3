Commodity Exchanges
   In New York to Join Globex
The two Chicago exchanges are working together with
Reuters PLC to develop the Globex system, where all futures
trades would be executed electronically when the traditional
trading pits are closed. Despite problems this year, Leo
Melamed, chairman of Globex, said at a session of the Futures
Industry Association's annual meeting here that he expects
the system to begin operating this year.
   Affiliation will allow the New York exchanges to list
their contracts on the Globex system, giving members of other
exchanges the opportunity to trade them.
