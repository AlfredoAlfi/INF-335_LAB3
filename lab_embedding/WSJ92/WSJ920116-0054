Business Brief -- Southdown Inc.:
   Company Expects to Post
   Net Loss for 4th Quarter
The company said results continued to be hurt by the
recession-related slowdown in construction, particularly in
Florida and southern California. In addition, an increase in
its allowance for bad debt, higher interest costs related to
a new issue of debt and a prepayment charge for repaying old
debt contributed to the loss.
   The company said it decided to write off its remaining
investment in Southdown Thermal Dynamics, a joint venture
with two individuals that was developing a unit to process
refinery wastes. Southdown said it sold its interest to its
partners for a note calling for it to receive 75% of any
proceeds, up to a maximum of $5 million, from selling the
interest by April 6.
