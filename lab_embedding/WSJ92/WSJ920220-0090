Japanese press reports also said Mr. Kawakami ran afoul of
the company's union by pushing "voluntary retirement" on more
than 700 of Yamaha's 12,000 employees as part of a
restructuring. The spokesman confirmed that 700 employees
took voluntary retirement, but he declined to comment on the
role that played in Mr. Kawakami's departure.
   "I decided to quit to rejuvenate the spirit of the company
people," Mr. Kawakami said.
   The company is the leader of the Yamaha group of loosely
affiliated companies, which includes the motorcycle maker
Yamaha Motor Co. In the year ended last March 31, Yamaha
Corp.'s operating profit dropped 35% to 6.3 billion yen ($49
million), while sales were flat at about 383 billion yen.
   Yamaha rose to prominence under Mr. Kawakami's predecessor
and father, Gen'ichi, who ran the company for more than three
decades. Analysts said the company was at its peak when the
younger Mr. Kawakami took over in 1983. Since then, results
have slipped; annual piano sales, for example, have remained
at about 170,000 units.
