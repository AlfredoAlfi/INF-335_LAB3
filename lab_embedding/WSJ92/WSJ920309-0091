Business Brief -- Mor-Flo Industries Inc.:
   Pact Is Reached to Reduce
   Price to Be Paid in Merger
Mor-Flo said the price drop reflects talks between the two
companies on concerns raised by the Justice Department about
the merger, as well as SABH's ongoing review of Mor-Flo's
business affairs. A Mor-Flo spokesman wouldn't comment on the
issues involved in the Justice Department review.
   Mor-Flo said it believes the Justice Department will issue
a formal determination later this month saying that it will
not challenge the merger. The company said completion of the
merger requires the approval of Mor-Flo's board and its
shareholders. Mor-Flo said it plans to hold a shareholder
meeting in May, and expects to complete the merger in June.
