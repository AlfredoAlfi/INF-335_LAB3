USAir Group Inc.'s USAir and Delta also applied for the
route to Italy, proposing service from Pittsburgh and
Atlanta, respectively. In giving the UAL Corp. unit final
approval, the department said United offered better access to
Italy for passengers originating in Washington; they now must
use connecting flights. United is required to begin service
within 90 days.
   The department also gave final approval to the sale of
America West Airlines' route between Honolulu and Nagoya,
Japan, to Wings Holdings Inc.'s Northwest Airlines. The $15
million sale will improve the viability of America West,
which last June filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the department said.
   In addition, the department tentatively approved the sale
to United of Pan American World Airways' Los Angeles-Mexico
City route. Pan Am reached agreement to sell the route to
United last November for $12.5 million, shortly before Pan Am
ceased operations. The route includes rights beyond Mexico
City to 19 points in the Caribbean and Latin America.
