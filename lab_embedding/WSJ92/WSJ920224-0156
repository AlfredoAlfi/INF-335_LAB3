   I was amazed that in your half-page-long article, only
four or five names are mentioned. Much of it is replete with:
U.S. officials, former intelligence officials, former Air
Force counterintelligence officials, Israeli officials,
former Pentagon officials, the Customs Service, Air Force
officials, the State Department, former FBI officials, etc. I
am sure I missed a few.
   You could have dreamed up 97% of the scenario related and
no one could prove you wrong. This article is typical
Israel-bashing.
