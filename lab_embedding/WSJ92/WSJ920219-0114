Mexico Fund Plans
   An Offering of Rights
Mexico Fund, which focuses on equities traded on the
Mexican Stock Exchange, is hoping to increase its asset base
to better take advantage of investment opportunities provided
by Mexico's surging economy. The fund's assets have grown to
approximately $611 million from $78 million in 1986.
   The subscription price of the new shares has not yet been
determined by the fund. In late trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Mexico Fund shares were quoted at $27.125, up 12.5
cents. Shares of the fund have nearly doubled in price over
the past year.
   The company said Lehman Brothers will manage the offering,
and that the rights will be transferable. The company doesn't
guarantee a market for the rights, but it said Lehman
Brothers "will use its best efforts to sell the rights on the
New York Stock Exchange."
