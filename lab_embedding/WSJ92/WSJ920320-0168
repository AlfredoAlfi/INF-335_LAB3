Pepper...and Salt
I've noticed as the years go by
   The birthday cards I get
   Proclaim that I am better now
   Than when, in fact, we met.
   They lavish on the compliments --
   My looks, my charm and such,
   Yet still I have a nagging doubt
   They doth attest too much.

   I often dream of paid employment,
   But the business world won't hire me --
   And no matter how I mess up here,
   The folks at home won't fire me.
