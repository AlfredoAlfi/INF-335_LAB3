Busch Says Data Question
   Lower Blood-Alcohol Limit
The study, performed by the Traffic Injury Research
Foundation of Canada and presented to law-enforcement
officials in Denver, indicates the average blood-alcohol
level of fatally injured drunk drivers in the U.S. was about
0.17% in 1990, the year for which the data were collected.
The legal limit in most states is 0.10%.
   Herb Simpson, executive director of the research group,
said he thinks the research indicates law enforcement
officials should reallocate their resources and efforts to
catching and rehabilitating the "hard core" drinker, rather
than the "social" drinker. The hard-core drinker, or one with
high blood-alcohol levels, is 200 times more likely to be
involved in a fatal crash than non-drinking drivers, Dr.
Simpson's research found.
   Anheuser-Busch opposes lowering blood-alcohol limits to
0.08% or 0.05%, as is being considered in several states, and
will disseminate the research data in various states where
blood-alcohol limits are an issue, said Stephen Lambright,
vice president at the company.
