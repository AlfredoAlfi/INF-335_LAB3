Park Inns Says It Plans
   To Start Tender Offer
   If Nendels Rejects Bid
"We're preparing to go full speed ahead and take the
matter to the shareholders, regardless of the board's
decision," Mr. Read said. He said details of the tender offer
hadn't been completed.
   Nendels, based in Seattle, said yesterday it is studying
Park's bid and was seeking financial information from the
company. C. Richard Kearns, Nendels president and chief
executive officer, said the board hadn't rejected any bid
from Park.
   Park's offer was made through Aspinone Ventures Ltd., an
investor group that includes Mr. Read, John P. Matlick,
Nendels's former president and chief executive officer, and
John F. Rothman, a Nendels shareholder. The group controls
about 18% of Nendels's 1.25 million shares outstanding, Mr.
Read said. Park signed a letter of intent March 10 to
purchase 22% more of Nendels shares from Clyde Billman, an
Ogden, Utah, investor, he said.
   Each company franchises about 70 hotels in the U.S. and
Canada.
