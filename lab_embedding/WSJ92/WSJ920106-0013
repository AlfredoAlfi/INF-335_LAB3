IBM Wins Injunction
   Against Seagate's Use
   Of Disk-Drive Design
IBM filed its lawsuit last October in the federal court in
Minneapolis, alleging that Seagate, of Scotts Valley, Calif.,
and Mr. Bonyhard misappropriated trade secrets related to
IBM's work on so-called magneto-resistive (MR) heads. Mr.
Bonyhard used to head IBM's effort to develop MR heads and
left last June to take a similar position at Seagate.
   An IBM spokesman said the company so far has spent $200
million over the last 20 years to develop MR heads and the
production techniques to build them. "There's significant
competitive advantage in possessing that knowledge," he said.
   Seagate on Friday referred questions to its chief outside
counsel James DiBoise, in Palo Alto, Calif., who said "we
think the court was incorrect and we intend to appeal as soon
as possible." Mr. Bonyhard couldn't be reached for comment.
   Last month the computer giant became the first company to
bring an MR-based disk drive to market. IBM said it expects
MR technology in the next decade to boost by several times
over conventional systems the storage capacity of personal
computer disk drives.
