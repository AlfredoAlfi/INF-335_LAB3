Continental Air Creditors
   Are Cleared to Sue Lorenzo
The creditors claim the transaction deprived Continental
of an opportunity to sell equity to SAS at a time when the
company needed additional equity. In addition, they claim
that Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker knew, or should have known,
that Continental was technically insolvent when it paid them
about $20 million to buy out their employment contracts.
   The creditors are seeking $180 million in compensatory and
punitive damages from the two men and Jet Capital Corp.,
through which they held most of their stake. Mr. Lorenzo said
the transactions were "appropriate and in the best interests
of Continental."
   Judge Balick also allowed the creditors to seek recovery
of $124 million from the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp. The agency has said it will oppose the creditors'
motion.
