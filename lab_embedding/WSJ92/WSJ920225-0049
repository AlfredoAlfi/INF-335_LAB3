Justice Stevens Undergoing
   Prostate Cancer Treatment
Justice Stevens was found to have cancer of the prostate
during a routine test recently, but the statement didn't
specify when the test took place. A biopsy indicated that the
tumor was limited to the prostate.
   A somewhat unpredictable moderate known for his attention
to factual nuances in cases, Justice Stevens was appointed in
1975 by President Ford.
