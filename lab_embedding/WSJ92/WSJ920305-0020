   Entertainment Plans
   Public Stock Offering
The remainder of the shares will be sold by the Christian
Broadcasting Network, which had owned the channel until a
sale more than two years ago.
   International Family Entertainment officials wouldn't give
specific details about the offering. But industry executives
said they believe the network and its parent could have a
total value approaching $400 million to $450 million. The 10
million publicly traded shares would be part of about 21.6
million common shares oustanding, plus roughly $135 million
in long-term debt that includes instruments convertible into
equity.
   The Family Channel, an ad-supported cable network that
dropped most of its religious programming in favor of
family-oriented entertainment starting in the early 1980s,
said proceeds will be used for producing shows, marketing
campaigns and investments and acquisitions.
   International Family Entertainment is 18%-owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., the U.S.'s largest cable operator.
The Robertson family and company employees own the remaining
stake.
