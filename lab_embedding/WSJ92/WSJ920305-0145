   Radio Band Is Slated
   For Satellite-Based
   Cellular Phone Use
The decision to set aside a dedicated band -- 1610-1626.5
MHz -- for mobile satellite services allows U.S. projects to
move forward. Motorola Inc.'s Iridium unit, TRW Inc., and
Loral Corp. have proposed satellite-based mobile telephone
services. The Federal Communications Commission is expected
to act soon to issue licenses for the new services.
   Iridium, for instance, has proposed a $3.5 billion
personal communications system using 77 low-earth-orbit
satellites. The company plans to begin launching the
satellites in 1994, and the system would be in full operation
about three years later. The company said it will be signing
up other members of an operating consortium and will be
seeking licenses in countries around the world.
