GM Unit Rushes to Tout
   Honor From Motor Trend
The Seville was redesigned for 1992, and the STS version
has a base price of $37,975. The new Seville is strikingly
different from the traditional chrome-laden, cushy-ride
Cadillacs that appealed to older customers. Its curved,
European-style dashboard, smaller size and relatively
chromeless exterior have won younger buyers.
   This is the second time in the award's 40 years that a
Cadillac has won the magazine's top honors for a domestic
car.
   "At Cadillac, we've paid our dues for cars that weren't
worthy to win," said John O. Grettenberger, Cadillac's
general manager. "Seville is living proof that Detroit and
the American auto industry can design distinctive,
fun-to-drive cars."
