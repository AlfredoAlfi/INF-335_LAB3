Marketing  Media:
   Radio Consultant Predicts
   Bleak Year for Industry
Speaking at his annual radio-management conference here,
Mr. Pollack said that the trend toward ever-narrower niche
programming will continue. He predicts a continued decline in
"Top 40" stations and an increase in country stations.
   "Mainstream formats are history: in any market with
competition, you simply can't play everything from rap to
dance to pop," says Mr. Pollack. His advice to the
diminishing band of Top 40 stations: choose the narrower
niche of either all dance and rap music, or cutting-edge,
alternative rock music. "Mainstream" rock and pop acts had
poor attendance in 1991 concerts, he says, and listeners
don't feel passionate about their music. On the other hand,
rap has a passionate following and so does the new crop of
raw underground rock bands.
