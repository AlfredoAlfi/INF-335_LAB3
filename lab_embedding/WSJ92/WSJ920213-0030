International Brief -- Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A.:
   Spanish Aerospace Concern
   To Receive Capital Infusion
According to Casa Chairman Javier Alvarez Vara, INI and
MBB will subscribe to a new Casa share issue. To maintain its
current 2.6% share, MBB will need to invest 1.11 billion
pesetas. If MBB ultimately decides against injecting new
funds, its stake in Casa will be reduced to 0.69%, Mr.
Alvarez Vara said.
   With debt of 131 billion pesetas and capital of 16.20
billion pesetas, Casa needs fresh cash to strengthen its
balance sheet and position itself for a possible alliance
with a foreign aerospace company, Mr. Alvarez Vara said.
   For 1991, Casa expects to post a net loss of seven billion
pesetas.
