Business Brief -- Benguet Corp.:
   Philippine Mining Concern
   Posts 64% Drop in '91 Net
Dennis Belmonte, president and chief operating officer,
said revenue dropped as a result of declines in production
volume and metal prices. The company also suffered from the
temporary stoppage of operations at one of its mines, which
was affected by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June.
Regular shipments from the mine resumed in December.
   The company also said its Antamok Gold Project, which was
built at a cost of $60 million, started commercial operations
on Jan. 1.
