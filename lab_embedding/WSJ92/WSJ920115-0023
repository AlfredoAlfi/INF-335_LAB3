Business Brief -- Chicago Board of Trade:
   Mortgage-Backed Contracts
   Are Temporarily Suspended
The exchange plans Project A as an alternative to pit
trading for selected futures and options contracts. "It will
be almost like a bulletin board and will be used for
low-volume contracts," an exchange spokesman said.
   Exchange members both on and off the CBOT floor will be
able to enter orders for contracts traded on Project A into
computer terminals. The computer then will automatically
match the order with a comparable order from another trader.
   The mortgage-backed contracts, which track the performance
of the secondary mortgage market, are ideal for Project A
because they traditionally have traded steadily but in small
volume, the spokesman said. Another contract that may be
traded on Project A is the CBOT's proposed scrap steel
futures contract.
