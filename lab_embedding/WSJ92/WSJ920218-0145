Coopers  Lybrand
   Reaches Settlement
   In MiniScribe Case
But Houston lawyer Joseph D. Jamail, who represented the
plaintiffs, said, "My clients are well pleased with the
settlement." The Texas jury had found that his clients lost
almost $13.5 million, plus $7 million in potential earnings.
   The settlement doesn't cover the other two defendants in
the case, MiniScribe's investment banking firm, Hambrecht 
Quist and its former chairman, Q.T. Wiles.
   The settlement came after Coopers filed a motion asking
state District Judge Roy Engelke of Galveston to set aside
the jury verdict, which Coopers had called "a vastly
excessive and unconscionable punitive award."
   As part of the settlement, Judge Engelke signed an order
setting aside the verdict, which he described as "not
supported by sufficient evidence."
   In a news release, Coopers hailed that order as a
vindication of its argument that it was itself a victim of
massive and collusive fraud by MiniScribe officials.
   But Mr. Jamail called the order perfunctory, saying "only
after I had the check in my pocket" did he agree to sign the
order written by Coopers.
   But a Coopers spokesman said the accounting firm would
never have agreed to the settlement without the judge's order
setting aside the jury's verdict.
