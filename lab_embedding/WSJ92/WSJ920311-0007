Larry Kimbell, senior vice president for the WEFA Group in
suburban Philadelphia, said the rise reflects a greater
willingness by both heavy industry and service-oriented
companies to lay off workers in order to trim fat. "It just
shows that if you get out the hatchet, you can raise
productivity," Mr. Kimbell said. "But it's the diametric
opposite of job security."
   Productivity in the manufacturing sector rose at a 1.4%
annual rate in the fourth quarter, matching its increase for
the full year. It rose at an annual rate of 3.8% in the third
quarter. Initially, productivity in manufacturing had been
estimated to have climbed at a 1.5% pace for the fourth
quarter and 1.4% for all of 1991.
   Non-farm business output grew 0.6% in the fourth quarter,
after a 1.6% third-quarter jump. In the third quarter,
non-farm business productivity rose at an annual rate of
3.8%.
   The revised figures show that productivity for all
businesses, including farming, grew at a 2.2% annual rate in
the fourth quarter and 0.2% for the year. While the 1991
figure remained unchanged, the fourth-quarter growth rate
initially had been pegged at 1.6%.
