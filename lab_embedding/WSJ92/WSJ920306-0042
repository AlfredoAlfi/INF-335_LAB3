Business Brief -- AM International Inc.:
   Salomon Is Hired to Assess
   Possible Sale of Company
In the company's second quarter ended Feb. 1, AM reported
a loss of $6.5 million and said that backlog at the end of
the quarter dropped significantly. AM expects a loss for
fiscal 1992 because it "sees no indication" that the graphics
markets or the global economy is improving.
   Last October, AM suspended the quarterly 50 cent dividend
on its $2 convertible exchangeable preferred stock to avert
any potential violation of a covenant for its senior
subordinated debentures.
