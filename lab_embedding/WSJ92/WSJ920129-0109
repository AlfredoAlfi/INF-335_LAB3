Business Brief -- Thyssen AG:
   Firm Says Quarterly Profit
   Fell, Sees Trend Continuing
"We most probably will have a lower profit than the
previous year," the chairman said, but he said it is
"certain" that results will be "clearly positive."
   Thyssen's fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
   Consolidated sales in the first quarter rose 8.3% to 9.17
billion marks ($5.69 billion) from 8.47 billion marks a year
earlier. The company said the gain was due in large part to
big deliveries from its Blohm  Voss shipbuilding unit and
its Thyssen Nordseewerken offshore equipment unit.
