International:
   British Airways, KLM Sue
   Sabena to Recoup Money
A Sabena spokeswoman said the Belgian airline has been
unable to reimburse the funds because of delays in its
restructuring efforts. "We intend to pay it back as soon as
possible," she said.
   fficials from both British Airways and KLM said they
expected to receive the money without the legal action
reaching a conclusion, but felt the move necessary as a
precaution. The lawsuits were filed separately in Belgian
Commercial Court.
   A combination of forces led to the venture's collapse. In
July 1990, the European Community Commission raised
objections to the linkup, fearing it would inhibit
competition at Brussels airport. But the final blow came
later that year. In November, Pierre Godfroid took over as
chairman of Sabena and began to reevaluate his airline. Mr.
Godfroid began a restructuring plan that required a
recapitalization far beyond the injections planned by the
British and Dutch airlines. The two minority partners pulled
out of the deal and Sabena World Airlines subsequently
reported an operating loss of 7.2 billion francs for 1990.
