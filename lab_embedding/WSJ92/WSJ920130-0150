Information Resources
   Sees Strong Growth;
   Stock Triples in Year
They also expressed confidence that IRI will continue to

   Neither executive would comment on 1991 earnings. Nor
would they narrow the unusually wide range of estimates on
Wall Street.
   Analyst James Dougherty of County NatWest is at the low
end, estimating 58 cents for the year, with 16 cents in the
fourth quarter. He also questions whether the stock's runup
is supported by earnings. Rita Spitz at Wm. Blair  Co. in
Chicago is more bullish, putting 1991 earnings at between 65
and 70 cents. That spread reflects her uncertainty about the
fourth quarter, where, she says the signing of one or two
major clients could result in a big swing.
   For the first nine months, IRI reported record earnings of
$9.4 million, or 42 cents a share, on revenue of $148.8
million. For all of 1990 the company earned $2.8 million, or
15 cents a share, on revenue of $166.7 million. Those figures
include a loss equal to three cents a share on discontinued
operations and another loss of seven cents from changes in
software revenue accounting.
