Letters to the Editor:
   A Move to Reclaim
   Abandoned Miners
This program is no longer sustainable for the current
contributing companies. The funding base continues to
decline, yet everyone agrees retirees should continue to get
benefits. We believe Sen. Rockefeller's legislation --
requiring current and formerly contributing companies to be
responsible for their own retirees, and joining with the rest
of the industry to pay for these retirees whose companies no
longer exist -- to be a fair solution.
   Ten years ago, the entire coal industry was assessed a fee
to reclaim abandoned mines. It is neither unprecedented nor
inappropriate to enact an industry fee to reclaim our
abandoned miners. This bill is an industry solution to an
industry problem and will not cost taxpayers one cent.
