   Concern Sues AMB in Bid
   To Get More Voting Rights
AGF accused AMB of blocking it from exercising voting
rights commensurate with AGF's 25% shareholding in AMB.
State-controlled AGF recently built up its stake in AMB
without AMB's consent.
   AMB argues that the majority of AGF's shareholding is in
restricted registered shares, which must first be entered in
the company's share register before any voting rights can be
conferred. Which shares get entered in the register is
entirely at the discretion of AMB's management board, an AMB
spokesman said.
   Following the collapse late last year of what AMB called
"exploratory talks" between the two companies, AGF has
continued to buy AMB shares, while AMB's management has
consistently rebuffed the French suitor.
