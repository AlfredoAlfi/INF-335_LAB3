Credit Ratings
ROHR Inc. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the
Ba-1 subordinated debt rating of the Chula Vista, Calif.,
company on review for possible dowgrade. About $265 million
of debt is affected. The ratings agency said the review was
prompted by concerns about Rohr's business outlook and its
previous announcement that it expects to be indicted as a
result of a federal investigation of aircraft-component
testing practices at one of its plants. Rohr, a maker of
nacelle systems for the aerospace industry, said it plans to
meet with the ratings agency soon to discuss the matter.
