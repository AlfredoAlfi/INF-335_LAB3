Texas Utilities Given
   Some Breathing Room
   On Scrubbers at Plants
"We are pleased with the board's decision and will fund
the study as required," said a Texas Utilities spokesman.
   If the study shows conclusively that the sulfur dioxide
belching from the four units is a problem, then the utility
would have to reduce emissions at each site to comply with
the Texas regulation limiting sulfur dioxide emissions to 1.2
pounds for each one million British thermal units by the year
2000, the agency said. Board engineers estimate two of the
units emit 1.76 pounds each per million BTU, while the other
two emit 2.4 pounds each. The Texas requirement is stricter
than the federal Clean Air Act, which requires reduced
emissions on a systemwide basis and not site by site.
   Compliance would mean installing scrubbers at a cost of at
least $150 million, said the spokesman, with annual operating
costs of another $150 million or so a year. Texas Utilities
would have faced such costs immediately had the Air Control
Board chosen to call for full compliance by 1996 or required
90% reduction by 2000. Those two options were considered.
