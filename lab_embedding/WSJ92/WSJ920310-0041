Business Brief -- Niagara Share Corp.:
   Firm Agrees to Be Acquired
   For Scudder Growth Shares
Robert J.A. Irwin, president of Niagara Share, said the
fund has about $220 million in assets, about 50% in cash and
a net asset value of just over $15 a share. The fund has
slightly more than 14 million shares outstanding. "A fund our
size is just too small," Mr. Irwin said. "It is hard for a
closed-end fund to bring in new money."
   Following the share exchange, Niagara Share would make a
liquidating distribution of Scudder Growth and Income Fund
shares to its shareholders in exchange for their Niagara
Share common stock.
   Niagara Share officials said shareholders should benefit
over the long term from the lower expense ratio of the
Scudder fund.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Niagara Share stock
closed at $14.625 a share, up 12.5 cents.
