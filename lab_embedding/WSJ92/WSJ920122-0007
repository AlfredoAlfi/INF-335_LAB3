Cuomo's New York Budget
   To Cut Welfare, Payroll
Gov. Cuomo said his budget would also close a $938 million
deficit for the current fiscal year -- more than the $875
million deficit that had been forecasted -- through $407
million in spending cuts and $531 million in borrowing. The
budget plan is 6% larger than the prior year's budget, though
after subtracting $17.85 billion in federal funds, state
spending would only creep up 2.8%.
   He also repeated a call for an $800 million "Jobs for the
New, New York" bond act for infrastucture investments.
   Gov. Cuomo presents his budget plan amid a recession, loss
of jobs and a budgetary stalemate with the state's
legislature.
   Republican Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino, who has
opposed several of the governor's budget plans, said the
latest budget does little to slow the growth in Medicaid and
welfare, and still relies too heavily on new taxes and
assessments on hospitals, nursing homes and other groups.
