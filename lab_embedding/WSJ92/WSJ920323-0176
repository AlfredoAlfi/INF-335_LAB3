   Wordstar Signs
   Letter of Intent
   To Acquire Delrina

WordStar, an early leader in word-processing software, is
attempting a turnaround after years of dismal results. It is
obtaining two promising applications that take advantage of
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows extension to DOS, the software to
control the basic operations of most personal computers.
   Delrina, which had sales of 7.7 million Canadian dollars
(US$6.4 million) for the six months ending Dec. 31, sells a
family of electronic forms and a program called WinFax that
makes it possible to send and receive faxes while working in
any Windows applications.
   Ron Posner, who will remain as WordStar's chief executive
officer, said he expects the deal to close by June 1. He said
Delrina gives WordStar strong offerings in two Windows niches
that aren't dominated by large software concerns.
   Presently, WordStar is making little headway in the
crowded word-processing market, where Microsoft and
WordPerfect Inc. have an overwhelming presence. Yet the
company has relatively strong sales outside of North America
where Delrina's products aren't well known.
   Mr. Posner said WordStar may change its name following the
completion of the deal to reflect Delrina's role and the
company's new emphasis on supplying what he called "document
management" software.
