   Searle Receives FDA Approval
Maxaquin, known generically as lomefloxacin HCl, is the
"first oral antibiotic {available} to reduce the incidence of
infections associated with the post-operative period of
trans-urethral surgery," said a Searle spokesman. He declined
to forecast sales, but said that "we anticipate the product
will achieve a good acceptance."
   Searle licenses the drug from Japan's Hokuriku Seiyaku,
and has world-wide marketing rights except in Japan, Taiwan
and a few countries in Eastern Europe.
