Business Brief -- Canguard Health Technologies Inc.:
   Firm Asks Court to Dismiss
   Suit Over Parkinson's Drug
Vancouver-based Canguard announced in November its plans
to seek regulatory approval for its Parkinson's disease
treatment. Deprenyl Research, which has Canadian rights to
deprenyl, a Parkison's drug developed by Chinoin
Pharmaceutical  Chemical Works of Hungary, filed the suit in
December, seeking the injunction and unspecified financial
damages.
   Canguard and its partner, Pharmascience Inc., Montreal,
said they haven't infringed the patent Deprenyl holds on the
process used to manufacture the drug, marketed in Canada as
Eldepryl.
