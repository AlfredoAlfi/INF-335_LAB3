   Pelican Offices, RTC Says
First Commerce will assume all of Pelican's insured
deposits, totaling $1.48 billion, and will buy $695.5 million
of the failed institution's total assets of $1.35 billion.
   The RTC will advance $1.17 billion to First Commerce and
will retain about $652.1 million of Pelican's assets. The
agency expects to recoup some of its advance through the sale
of assets; the ultimate cost to the taxpayer is estimated at
$445.9 million.
