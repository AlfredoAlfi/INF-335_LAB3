Ex-AP Executive
   Settles SEC Charges
   Over Insider Trading
The suit is part of a continuing investigation of the
Waldbaum deal. It names Robert Toomey, 51 years old, of Glen
Ridge, N.J., who is a former vice president of AP's Michigan
group, and William Merrigan, 46, of Pittstown, N.J., an
executive who reported to Mr. Toomey.
   At the time it filed the lawsuit, the SEC announced that
Mr. Merrigan agreed to settle the suit by disgorging profits
and paying interest totaling $88,000. Mr. Merrigan, who
settled without admitting to any wrongdoing, also will pay a
civil penalty of $59,000.
   The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Merrigan made about $65,000
by purchasing Waldbaum stock before news of the deal with AP
was made public. It also alleges that Mr. Merrigan avoided
losses on his Shopwell stock by selling it before the public
knew that that deal had fallen through. The deal, however,
was revived and completed later in 1986. In both cases Mr.
Toomey is alleged by the SEC to have passed the information
to Mr. Merrigan.
   "Mr. Toomey did no trading," his attorney, Elliot G.
Sagor, said. "We have not settled since Mr. Toomey did not
pass along any information with the expectation that anyone
would trade on it."
