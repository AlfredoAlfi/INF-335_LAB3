International Brief -- Akzo N. V.:
   Dutch Chemical Group Says
   1991 Net Income Fell 13%
"The issue for Akzo is simply whether profits have
bottomed out in 1991. And if we're seeing a turnaround in
quarterly profits, that's obviously good news," noted
Alisdair Nisbet, analyst with UBS Phillips  Drew Securities
in London. As the effects of Akzo's restructuring plans come
on line, profitability should continue to improve gradually,
analysts said.
   But the company itself was reluctant to voice any concrete
hopes for an upturn. The most positive comment Chairman
Aarnout Loudon would make was to say that the company's
proposal to pay out an unchanged dividend of 6.5 guilders
"expresses a measure of confidence" in the performance in
1992.
