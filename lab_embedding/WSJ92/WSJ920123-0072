Business Brief -- Conner Peripherals Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Profit Sank
   72% Due to Weak Demand
Conner said it had been hurt by the continuing effects of
world-wide recession and increasing competition, which have
slowed demand and lowered prices.
   Earnings for the quarter included a gain of about $11
million from the sale of one of its two production plants in
Malaysia, which was entirely offset by charges from
previously announced layoffs and its production move to
Malaysia from Singapore.
