Business Brief -- Chattem Inc.:
   Firm Expects to Post Rise
   In Net of 46% for Fiscal '91
For its fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, 1991, Chattem
expects to report net income of about $1.1 million, or 26
cents a share, compared with net income of $504,000, or 13
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to about $30.7
million from $21.2 million.
   Per-share earnings reflect a 3-for-1 stock split that took
effect Sept. 3, 1991.
   Chattem, which makes health and beauty-care products and
specialty chemicals, saw fiscal 1991 sales rise to about
$100.7 million, up 19% from $84.4 million the previous year.
The increase resulted largely from the strong performance of
the company's consumer products area, aided by growth in its
chemicals area, said Robert E. Bosworth, executive vice
president and chief financial officer. The only shadow on the
results was cast by Chattem's international sales, about $13
million of the total, which fell slightly below expectations,
Mr. Guerry said.
