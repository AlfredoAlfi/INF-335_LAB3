   TV Unit Signs Agreement
   With Witt-Thomas-Harris
The production company, formed by Paul Junger Witt, Tony
Thomas and Susan Harris, is known for hands-on involvement
with their shows and independence from the studios that
finance them.
   The agreement takes effect July 1, when
Witt-Thomas-Harris's agreement with Disney expires, but the
company will continue to produce four series for Disney, as
well as prepare a reconfigured "Golden Girls" for network
television.
