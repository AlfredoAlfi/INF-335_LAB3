Consolidated's Emery
   Sets Deal With DHL
   In Effort to Cut Costs
Once the agreement takes effect March 1, Emery said it
would close its existing European hub and feeder-aircraft
operation in Maastricht, the Netherlands, canceling all
contract flights both within Europe and a once-daily flight
to Europe from New York. Emery said seven of its employees
will be transferred to Brussels from the closed Netherlands
hub while about 20 others will be fired.
   Emery officials didn't have an estimate on how much they
would save from the move, the latest in a series of efforts
by management to restore solvency to an operation that has
been unprofitable since Consolidated acquired it in 1989.
Among other things, Consolidated has trimmed the losses by
abandoning Emery's high-cost overnight letter business and
focusing on shipments exceeding 50 pounds.
   The shift to heavy freight lessened considerably Emery's
competition with DHL, which focuses on small-package
delivery, and as a result the two companies said their new
arrangement presents no conflict. For Emery, the move cuts
the costs of maintaining expensive aircraft operations while
continuing a presence in Europe, and for DHL it means
increased business.
