Marketing  Media:
   Sony Expected to Aim
   New Record Label
   At Children's Market
Sony's new label closely follows the launch of a new
children's label from the Bertelsmann Music Group, BMG Kidz,
which will enter into joint ventures with children's audio
and video companies.
   Sony's artists include folk singers Pete Seeger, Tom
Chapin and Tom Paxton as well as Rory, a female entertainer.
   Linda Morgenstern, formerly head of Random House's
children's music series, will oversee Sony Kids' Music.
   Sony couldn't be reached for comment, but the company
scheduled a news conference for tomorrow morning to announce
the launch of the label.
   According to a person close to the company, Sony is
scheduled to release its first product by March 10. The
products will be available in toy and book stores as well.
   With Sony now joining the ranks, virtually every record
company has a children's label. Sony and others are trying to
get a foothold in the lucrative market that is clearly
dominated by 36-year-old Walt Disney Co.'s record division.
Last year, the label boasted four gold albums (selling more
500,000 units) and one platinum album (selling more than one
million units), "Beauty and the Beast."
