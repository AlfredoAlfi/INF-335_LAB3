Baytank Pleads Guilty
   To Charges of Violating
   Environmental Laws
The company and the three men had previously been tried on
these charges in 1988. Although a jury convicted them, the
district court dismissed certain counts and granted a new
trial on other charges. Both sides appealed, and the U.S.
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated guilty verdicts
against Baytank and ordered a retrial for the employees.
   The original indictment charged the company with
negligently discharging hazardous chemicals into a
ship-turning basin near the Gulf Coast.
