Marketing Brief -- Triad Artists Inc.:
   Labor Panel Won't Hear
   Claim Filed by TV Actress
When an agency takes a packaging commission, it receives a
percentage of the profits of a TV series, rather than the
usual fees tied to individual clients' earnings. Some have
charged that the commissions create a conflict of interest
about who the agency actually is representing.
   A spokesman for Ms. Arnold called the commission's action
"only a technical ruling relating to the narrow issue of
venue." He said the actress was "extremely encouraged" about
the ultimate result.
