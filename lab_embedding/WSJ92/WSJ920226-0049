Business Brief -- Encor Inc.:
   Oil and Gas Concern Says
   It May Default on Debt
The Calgary, Alberta, company attributed its poor outlook
to declining revenue and an erosion of its asset base. It
blamed last year's deterioration of the natural-gas market, a
stronger Canadian dollar and price differences between light
and heavy grades of crude oil.
   Encor reported a 1991 loss of C$75.6 million, or 58
Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$269.6 million. A year
earlier, the company had a loss of C$58 million, or 47
Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$313.6 million.
