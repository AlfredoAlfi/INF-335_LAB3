Business Brief -- National Gypsum Co.:
   Creditors Ask for Trustee
   To Oversee Reorganization
As expected, creditors also filed a reorganization plan at
odds with that of management. Among other things, creditors
said their plan calls for present and all future asbestos
claimants to receive 100% of insurance proceeds of
asbestos-related litigation and 100% of the stock of National
Gypsum's Austin Co. subsidiary. They would also get up to
$17.5 million in cash and four-year warrants to purchase as
much as to 3% of National Gypsum's common stock.
   National Gypsum officials couldn't be reached immediately
for comment.
