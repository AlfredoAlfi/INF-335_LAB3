MICC Investments Share Offer
About C$80 million of the proceeds were to have been used
by MICC to repay obligations to Central Capital, which has
been negotiating with its creditors to reschedule its debt
after missing a principal repayment of C$214 million in
November.
   Stanley Beck, vice chairman of Central Capital, said he
still expects the creditors to agree to a debt rescheduling
despite the cancellation of the subsidiary's share flotation.
"It's not a deal breaker," he said.
   All the companies are based in Toronto.
