Orthwein Will Buy
   51% of New England
   Patriots From Kiam
An attorney for Mr. Orthwein said he will pay $23.4
million for Mr. Kiam's 51% ownership stake and assume the
Patriots' $45 million in team debt. The attorney said Mr.
Orthwein will negotiate with the Patriots' 49% owner, Fran
Murray, over a $40 million buy-out agreement that Mr. Kiam
was unable to honor. The deal appears to value the Patriots
at more than $100 million.
   Both Mr. Orthwein and Mr. Murray, a Philadelphia
businessman, are involved in an effort to get an expansion
franchise for St. Louis, which has been without a football
team since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Ariz. Mr. Orthwein
said he doesn't plan to move the Patriots to another market,
but he said that, "I will not be the Patriots owner
indefinitely."
   Mr. Orthwein, whose mother was a member of the Busch
family that founded Anheuser-Busch Cos., brewer of Budweiser
beer, was chairman of the advertising firm D'Arcy-McManus 
Masius. He is now chairman of Huntleigh Asset Partners L.P.,
a private investment firm.
