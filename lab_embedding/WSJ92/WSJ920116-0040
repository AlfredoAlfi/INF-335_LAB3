Business Brief -- Crane Co.:
   Charge Totaling $23 Million
   To Be Reported on Benefits
Crane, like many other U.S. companies, said it decided to
catch up now with accrued liabilities for projected retiree
benefits rather than wait until 1993 when a new accounting
rule on the benefits, called FASB 106, becomes mandatory. In
late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Crane's stock was quoted at $26, up 37.5 cents.
