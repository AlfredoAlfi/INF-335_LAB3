Business Brief -- A.H. Belo Corp.:
   Special Gain of $3.2 Million
   To Be Posted This Quarter
The company said it settled the claim in January and
recently reached an agreement on the distribution of the
proceeds. In the first quarter last year, the company had a
loss of $1.9 million, or 10 cents a share, largely because of
increased costs and reduced advertising due to the Persian
Gulf War.
