   Sony Corp. to Begin Selling
   5.2 Ounce Tape Recorder
The sound quality isn't quite as good as other digital
formats, but the Scoopman is the lightest at 5.2 ounces,
battery included. Overall, the Scoopman measures 2.1 inches
by 4.4 inches by 0.9 inches.
   The price tag is $800 and it will go on the market Feb. 21
in Japan and at a later date overseas, Sony said.
   As in regular digital audio tape, the Scoopman recorder
uses a spinning head that records a series of lines on a
tape, but it traces each line several times during playback.
The digital information from the tracings is combined in a
semiconductor memory that permits high-quality playback even
if each tracing isn't completely accurate, Sony said.
   That allows the new tape recorder to use a much simpler
tape alignment and loading system. Sony officials say its
integrated circuits contain the equivalent of 1.8 million
transistors.
