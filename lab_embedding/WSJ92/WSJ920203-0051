International:
   Japan Opens Investigation
   Into Possible Bid-Rigging
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The dango system, which is a long-established custom in
Japan's construction industry, has been a prime target of
U.S. trade negotiators. They say the system makes it almost
impossible for outsiders to enter Japan's lucrative
construction market.
   In a series of Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments
Initiative talks, Japan agreed to U.S. demands that it
increase penalties and facilitate legal action against the
dango system. The commission has never filed a criminal
complaint against companies for participating in dango.
   A spokesman for one of the contractors involved, Taisei
Corp., conceded that such a club existed, but he said it was
only a "friendly association" and didn't engage in illegal
activity. Other company spokesmen declined comment, saying
they would await the results of the FTC's investigation.
