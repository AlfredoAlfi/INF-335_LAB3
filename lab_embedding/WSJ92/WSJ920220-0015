Business Brief -- Boeing Co.:
   Work Force Cuts of 4.2%
   Are Planned as Orders Slip
Boeing was affected by the cancellation of certain missile
programs and cutbacks in Northrop Corp.'s B-2 bomber program,
on which Boeing was a subcontractor. Boeing also said this
month it will slash its production of 737s to 14 a month from
21.
   The company currently employs 104,000 in its home state
and 156,500 companywide. Reductions this year will come
through a combination of layoffs and attrition, the company
said. A companywide hiring freeze, which took effect last
October, will continue indefinitely, it said.
