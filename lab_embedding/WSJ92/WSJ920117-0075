Business Brief -- Zurn Industries Inc.:
   Fourth-Period Profit Is Put
   At 50 to 55 Cents a Share
Mr. Schofield blamed the weak sales and earnings on slower
power-plant construction activity and the "continuing impact
of a weak economy, particularly on our manufacturing
business."
   But he said he's encouraged by Zurn's recent closing of
$155 million of orders for four power-generation plants,
which makes Zurn's backlog for fiscal 1992 about 50% higher
than the backlog it began with this fiscal year. "This will
provide the foundation for solid future growth," Mr.
Schofield said.
