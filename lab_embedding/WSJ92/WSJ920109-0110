Economy:
   Consumer Borrowing
   Was Flat in November
   After October Spurt
Auto loans outstanding, which represent more than a third
of all consumer installment credit outstanding, declined by
$952 million, or at a 4.2% annual rate. Revolving credit,
which includes credit cards, grew by $1.01 billion. That
represents an annual growth rate of 5.2%, substantially
slower than in the two previous months. Loans for other
purposes also fell.
   The figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. They
don't include increasingly popular home-equity credit lines.
   The Fed said that consumer loan interest rates were down a
bit, though not as much as other interest rates. The average
rate on four-year auto loan from a bank was 10.61% in
November, down from 11.06% in August, for instance. Financial
subsidiaries of the auto makers were charging 10.79%, down
from 12.4% in August. But credit-card interest rates remained
steady at 18.19% in November, barely declining from 18.24% in
August.
