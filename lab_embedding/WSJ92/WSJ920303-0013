Marketing  Media:
   Imasco's Hardee's Unit
   Restores Roy Rogers Menu
"We're finding that the Roy Rogers trademark is very
powerful," a Hardee's spokesman said. "It's an institution
and the consumer perceives it to be a cut above fast food."
   Consumers in the New York and Philadelphia markets will be
surveyed to determine whether to proceed with conversions or
settle on a hybrid restaurant. Accordingly, Hardee's is
testing three versions of signage, one of which features the
Roy Rogers name but notes that the store sells Hardee's'
hallmark breakfast.
   Separately, Ad Week magazine yesterday reported that
Hardee's is considering naming Jordan, McGrath, Case 
Taylor, New York, to handle advertising for Roy Rogers units
as a separate account. Ogilvy  Mather, Hardee's' primary ad
agency, picked up the Roy Rogers business after the chain's
purchase.
   Hardee's, a unit of Imasco Ltd. of Montreal, is considered
the third largest hamburger chain in the U.S., behind
McDonald's Corp. and Burger King Corp., a unit of Grand
Metropolitan PLC. Hardee's operating profit last year fell
35% to $40.3 million.
