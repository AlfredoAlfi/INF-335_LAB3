Senate Confirms Greenspan
   To Second Term at the Fed
The action comes amid criticism from some senators that
the chairman has mismanaged the central bank's response to
the recession. The criticism, however, wasn't strong enough
to pose a threat to his candidacy.
   The Senate also approved the nomination of J. Carter Beese
to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
