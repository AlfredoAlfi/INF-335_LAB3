fell to #2.6 million from #15.6 million. A #5.3 million drag
on profits caused by W.H. Smith's travel and television units
also was removed from the balance sheet.

pence a share from four pence a share.
   The company said its namesake news, book and stationary
stores performed well, as did its Waterstone's book stores
and its office products outlets.
