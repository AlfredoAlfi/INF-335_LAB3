Rating Agencies Plan
   To Take `Hard' Look
   At Ontario's Finances
"A lot of what's happening now was anticipated last year
when we lowered the Ontario rating two notches," Mr. Streeter
said. But he added that the U.S. economic recovery hasn't
picked up any steam, a factor which could affect Ontario's
own financial prospects. In addition, Moody's noted that
control of the deficit "will require more than budgetary
spending caps" which Mr. Rae proposed in a televised speech
Tuesday night.
   Moody's cut Ontario's rating from triple-A in May after
the introduction of the socialist governing party's first
budget, which projected a C$9.7 billion deficit for the
current fiscal year.
   Toronto's Dominion Bond Rating Service also reaffirmed its
own rating of Ontario's debt, but said the province's fiscal
performance is weaker than its credit rating would indicate.
The rating agency said it also expects to conduct a full
credit review following the release of the provincial budget
for the new fiscal year.
