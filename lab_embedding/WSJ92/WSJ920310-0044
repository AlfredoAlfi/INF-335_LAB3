Revco D.S. Creditors
   Vote to Approve Plan
   For Reorganization
Revco said the reorganization plan will become effective a
month to six weeks after being confirmed by the court. When
it takes effect, cash and securities will be issued to
creditors.
   Revco stock, however, may begin trading by the end of the
week on a when-issued basis, meaning the shares will trade
before they are issued.
   Revco stock could initially sell for about $10 a share,
but some estimates are as high as $12. Analysts are basing
their stock-price projections on the current price of Revco's
senior subordinated notes. In recent weeks, Revco bond prices
have risen more than 15%, largely the result of aggressive
buying by Goldman Sachs and of Revco's improved third-quarter
results, said Mark Schnitzer, an analyst with Dabney/Resnick
and Wagner Inc.
   Robert White, an attorney for bank creditors, said of the
vote, which was completed last Friday: "All the creditor
classes are happy because their returns are very significant
and way above what a lot of people might have anticipated six
months ago, largely because the company's performing very
well."
