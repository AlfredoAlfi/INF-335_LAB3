   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The spokesman said IHI will contribute about 5% of
development costs, with Rolls-Royce contributing 50%-60%.
Other partners will contribute the rest, he said.
   The two companies have already worked together on less
powerful engines that have been used on McDonnell Douglas and
Airbus Industrie passenger jets.
   The spokesman said Rolls-Royce already has orders from
Thai Airline for the new engine.
