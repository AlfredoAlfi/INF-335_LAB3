Who's News:
   Marsh  McLennan
   Names Top Officers
   At Insurance Unit
Messrs. Holbrook and Sinnott succeed Robert Clements, 59,
as chief executive, and Mr. Wroughton succeeds him as
chairman. As previously reported, Mr. Clements was named vice
chairman of the parent; Frank J. Tasco is the chairman.
   "Co-presidents and co-chief executives are not so
typical," Mr. Sinnott said, "but the way that we've worked
together, it happens to be a natural evolution. If you put
two people who hadn't worked together in the same roles, it
might be difficult, but not here."
   Mr. Sinnott said he and Mr. Holbrook have worked in the
same New York offices of Marsh  McLennan for nearly 30
years, and worked closely for the last 15.
   "It was made plain that this was not set up to be some
type of horse race. The job was presented to us as a
partnership. There is no plan for just one president, or just
one chief executive in the foreseeable future."
   He added that "Mr. Wroughton will work with us, but he'll
be in London, as it is a very large portion of the
operations. All the operations will report to the chief
executives as in a normal fashion, not the chairman, but the
three of us will be a collegial team."
   Marsh  McLennan Cos. also provides management consulting
and employee-benefits services through its William M. Mercer
Inc. unit, and reinsurance services.
   Separately, Edward G. Pringle, 50, and Vikesh Mahendroo,
39, were named directors at William M. Mercer, increasing the
Mercer board to 15 members.
