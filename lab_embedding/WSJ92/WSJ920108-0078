   Sales at BizMart Unit Rose
   55% in Four-Week Period
James Berk, president of Intelligent's consumer retail
group, said the increase "may be attributed in part to our
customers buying more computers and computer-related
merchandise as gifts." He added that its traditional office
products enjoyed double-digit sales growth.
   BizMart, a fast-growing chain of computer stores purchased
by Intelligent Electronics last June, operates 72 stores in
the western U.S., 44 of which were included in the sales
figures.
