Politics  Policy:
   How Poll Was Conducted
One registered voter, 18 years or older, was selected from
each household by a procedure to provide the correct number
of male and female respondents. The results of the survey
were minimally weighted by age to assure that the poll
accurately reflects registered voters nationwide.
   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters with
telephones had been surveyed using the same questionnaire,
the findings would differ from these results by no more than
2.6 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups is larger.
