Bush Receives Boost
   From Kohl Remarks
   On Foreign Policy
After Mr. Bush answered, Mr. Kohl said that while he
didn't want to "interfere" in U.S. elections, "if an American
asked my opinion . . . I would tell him that the destiny of
peoples is being decided on the foreign policy front."
Regarding such developments as the fall of the Soviet empire,
Mr. Kohl said, "Had President George Bush not proved to be
such a strong leader over these past years, obviously these
dramatic changes would not have taken place in the world."
   On the global trade issue, the two men reiterated their
commitment to bringing a successful conclusion to the current
round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. But they didn't give any details.
   Last week, government officials in Germany had indicated
that Chancellor Kohl was going to bring to the U.S.
agriculture proposals that could break the deadlock over
GATT. But U.S. trade officials characterized those proposals
as general, and added that no top U.S. trade officials
attended the meetings.
   "The issues are too political to be resolved at the
{trade} official level," said a government trade negotiator.
"And they're too technical to be resolved at the
heads-of-government level."
