Lifetime Hoan Says
   It Will Post 14% Rise
   In 4th-Quarter Sales
Milton L. Cohen, Lifetime's chairman and president, said
he is "very comfortable" with analysts' full-year net income
estimates of $1.07 a share, which takes into account a
recently announced 10% stock dividend. Before the stock
dividend, the estimate came in at $4.8 million, or $1.18 a
share, compared with the company's 1990 pro-forma earnings of
$2.7 million, or 89 cents a share. Mr. Cohen said sales
should approach $55 million.
   Lifetime Hoan, which has no debt, said it doesn't have any
immediate plans to sell additional shares or to issue any
debt.
   But the company hasn't emerged from 1991 entirely
unscathed by the recession. Mr. Cohen said the company's
fourth-quarter expectations also include a $100,000 charge
for accounts receivable related to R.H. Macy  Co.'s recent
bankruptcy-law filing. Macy is a major retailer of Lifetime's
products, accounting for about 3% of total sales.
