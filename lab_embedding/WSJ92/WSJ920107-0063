   Comsat Says Wussler
   Is Resigning as Head
   Of One of Its Units
The 55-year-old Mr. Wussler, a former president of CBS
Sports and CBS Television Network, said the change in
strategy made him believe it was time to "return to
traditional companies" engaged in television programming and
distribution. The executive, who joined the company two and a
half years ago, also said the imminent departure of Comsat
Chairman Irving Goldstein, who is taking the job of director
general at international satellite communication consortium
IntelSat, contributed to his decision to resign.
   The Video Enterprises unit acquired a majority stake in
the Denver Nuggets basketball team two weeks after Mr.
Wussler joined the company. Mr. Wussler said the investment
isn't yet profitable but had "turned around dramatically."
The pay-per-view business, he said, is "breaking even."
