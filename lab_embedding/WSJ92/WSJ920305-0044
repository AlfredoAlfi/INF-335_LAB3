Business Brief -- NationsBank Corp.:
   Bank Will Pay $40 Million
   To Be an Olympic Sponsor
The sponsorship, which is expected to be announced today,
is one of the early indications of a marketing coup for the
Atlanta Olympics committee, which says it hasn't yet begun
formally soliciting corporate sponsors.
   Billy Payne, president and chief executive officer of the
Atlanta committee, says he plans to solicit sponsorships from
about 60 companies starting next month, but already several
companies have expressed interest in sponsorship.
   Neither organization would confirm the sponsorship.
