Business Brief -- Nynex Corp.:
   New York Consumer Board
   Seeks Lower Phone Rates
A spokesman for New York Telephone, a unit of Nynex Corp.,
said that the company "just had layoffs for the first time in
100 years and remains among the lowest-earning phone
companies in the country." For 1991, the company's return on
equity was 10.3%, well below the authorized 12.2%, the
company said.
   The Consumer Protection Board estimated that New York
Telephone would earn a 14.9% return on equity this year and
14.4% in 1993, under current rates. Mr. Kessel petitioned the
state Public Service Commission to cut the company's allowed
return on equity to 11.2% and asked for a hearing April 7 to
review the petition.
