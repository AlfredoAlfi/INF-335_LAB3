   In Talks on Vaccine
   For Treating HIV
Immune Response is a biopharmaceutical concern engaged in
developing products for treatment of HIV infection and such
other autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis.
   Immunization Products Ltd., a joint venture between Immune
Response and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, is conducting clinical
trials of the HIV therapeutic vaccine on humans in the U.S.
The trials are scheduled to be completed later this year. The
Primary objective is to support a product license application
for 1993 and to secure Food and Drug Administration approval
for commerical marketeting of the HIV vaccine, Immuine
Response said.
   The Immune Response vaccine is based on a scientific
approach first suggested by Dr. Jonas Salk, a founder of
Immune Response and developer of the Salk polio vaccine. Dr.
Salk proposed using whole but inactivated AIDS viruses to
inoculate people already infected. Where other researchers
use genetically engineered or synthetic virus proteins, Dr.
Salk chose to use live viruses killed with gamma radiation.
