   Arthur Sulzberger Jr.
   As Its New Publisher
Mr. Sulzberger Jr., who had been deputy publisher since
1988, will continue to report to his father. He inherits a
newspaper that has been remade and refocused in design and
coverage in recent years and that faces stiff economic
problems. The recession in the New York area has sent ad
lineage plummeting, prompting the paper to offer staff
buy-outs and impose layoffs last year to reduce costs.
   "He has the challenge of bringing back the profit level
the Times once knew. It's still the pre-eminent paper, but he
has the difficult task of changing the paper for the 21st
century," said Kenneth T. Berents, an analyst at Alex. Brown
 Sons.
   The younger Mr. Sulzberger was groomed for his ascension
during most of his career. He started outside the company in
1974 as a reporter at the now-defunct Raleigh (North
Carolina) Times. In 1976, he became a reporter in London for
the Associated Press. In 1978, he joined the New York Times
as a reporter in Washington, then went on to hold various
jobs in ad sales, corporate planning and production.
