Business Brief -- Nippon Mining Co.:
   Pretax Loss of $3.9 Million
   Is Expected for Fiscal Year
The company also expects a group net loss of 12 billion
yen, as opposed to net income of 11 billion yen forecast in
June of last year. Profit came to 5.32 billion yen in the
preceding fiscal year.
   Nippon Mining said the downward revision is the result of
sharp drops in metals prices. The slump in the U.S.
semiconductor market has been especially detrimental, the
company said.
   Sales for the group are now projected to total 1.07
trillion yen, below the originally expected 1.15 trillion
yen, and below the previous fiscal year's 1.206 trillion yen.
