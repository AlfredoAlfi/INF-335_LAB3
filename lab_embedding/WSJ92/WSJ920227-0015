International Brief -- Honda Motor Co.:
   Quarterly Pretax Earnings
   Fell 24%; Sales Rose 2.8%
Sales were 1.045 trillion yen, up 2.8%. The gain was made
mainly on the back of strong motorcycle sales in Asia and
sales of new automobile models, the company said. However, it
said pretax profit fell because the yen was stronger during
the quarter compared with the like period a year ago, and
operating expenses grew at a faster rate than sales.
   Auto sales rose 4.1% to 873.70 billion yen, although in
terms of volume, auto sales slipped 3.7% during the
three-month period to 467,000 units.
   A spokesman at Honda said the company's predictions for
group net income and sales for the full fiscal year ending
March 31 are unchanged from those made in January. Net income
is seen rising 5.1% to 80.10 billion yen, while sales are
forecast at 4.528 trillion yen, up 5% from the previous year.
