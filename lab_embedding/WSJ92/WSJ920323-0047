Sun Sportswear Hires
   Firm to Help Devise
   Ways to Boost Value
David J. Taylor, Sun's secretary, said the company's stock
"does not reflect its continued earnings and superior balance
sheet." For the fourth quarter, usually a weak period for the
company, Sun posted a loss of $165,000, or three cents a
share, on revenue of $14.1 million.
   Mr. Sabey has been under some financial pressure since his
Frederick  Nelson department store chain sought protection
in September under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The chain is being liquidated. Kevin James, Sun's vice
president, finance, said there was no connection between Mr.
Sabey's problems with Frederick  Nelson and the sportwear
maker's decision to explore new business strategies.
   Sun said it doesn't plan on making any decisions about its
future until it receives recommendations from NationsBank,
which Mr. James said would take four to six weeks. The
company added it has received no merger proposals.
