   Prices of HDTV Sets
   Sink as Sharp Creates
   A Cheaper Version

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Japanese electronics makers generally agree that HDTV
won't become popular until the sets fall below one million
yen, but most have said they don't expect to achieve that for
several years.
   Sharp said it was able to reduce the price by simplifying
the complex circuits that convert HDTV broadcast signals into
a form that can be shown on a TV screen. It also developed
new highly integrated semiconductor chips that combine many
previous chips.
   A Sharp spokesman said the company plans to make 3,000
sets a month.
   HDTV images have much finer detail than current
televisions. The sets must process large amounts of picture
data.
