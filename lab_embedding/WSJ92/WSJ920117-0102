Business Brief -- General Motors Corp.:
   Talks on Sale of 50% Stake
   In Korea Venture Confirmed
Daewoo Motors, formed in 1984, was supposed to serve as a
manufacturing base for GM in Asia. However, the car assembled
there, the Pontiac LeMans subcompact car, has been plagued by
quality problems and poor sales in the U.S.
   "GM and Daewoo are exploring the possiblity of Daewoo
buying out GM's interest in {the venture}, subject to the
negotiations of acceptable price and other terms," GM said in
a brief statement. The two companies aren't "very far along,"
in their talks, a GM spokesman added. GM said it would
continue to supply parts to Daewoo Motors.
