   Will Stay in the Pot
   Of Founder, Plan Says
Mr. Copeland's plan calls for the bank group, led by
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, to be owed about $258
million after the company emerges from bankruptcy protection.
The group currently is owed about $280 million in principal
and interest. Merrill Lynch would receive only $2 million in
cash and release from certain claims against it only if it
agreed to the plan. Otherwise, Merrill Lynch wouldn't receive
anything. Mr. Copeland, however, would continue to own all
the company's stock.
   Under Mr. Copeland's plan, trade creditors would receive
about $12 million, or about 92 cents on the dollar, while
another $2 million would be reserved to settle litigation and
pay other unsecured claims. Copeland's preferred shareholders
would receive 50 cents a share for their stock.
   In contrast, the bank group's plan called for the bank
group to continue to hold an undisclosed amount of debt and
to receive all stock in the company. That plan calls for Mr.
Copeland to receive royalties equal to about $3 million a
year for his ownership of certain recipes; however, he
wouldn't own any of the company.
