Oil Firms Plan 1.3% Rise
   In Outlays, Survey Finds
Companies are basing their budgets on an average oil price
of $20.40 a barrel and an average natural gas price of $1.62
per thousand cubic feet. Those prices are slightly above
today's spot market quotes.
   In addition, the survey says, companies will shift more of
their budgets to development projects and away from
exploration. Furthermore, because of the prolonged weakness
in natural gas prices, energy concerns will shift more of
their focus to oil projects.
   The survey also found that for the first time a majority
of companies view buying reserves as a better option than
drilling for them. A record 72% are actively looking to
purchase reserves, primarily oil, Salomon said.
