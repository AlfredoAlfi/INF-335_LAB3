TCI Chairman Magness
   Had a Brush With BCCI
As this newspaper recently reported, the two executives
borrowed $500,000 from London-based Capcom and invested it in
a futures-market brokerage firm controlled by Capcom. That
firm was later expelled from the Chicago Board of Trade for
engaging in what the exchange termed "reckless and
unbusinesslike dealing."
   In 1988, Capcom was convicted of laundering drug money.
After the firm was indicted on the charge, Messrs. Magness
and Romrell swiftly cut all ties to it and maintain they were
duped into the investment and knew nothing of the company's
affairs.
