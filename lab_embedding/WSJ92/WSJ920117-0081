International:
   Western Germany's Retail Sales
The sales trend has been uneven since August, when a
one-year 7.5% income tax surcharge as well as higher levies
on cigarettes, heating oil and gasoline that took effect July
1 began pinching consumers pocketbooks.
   Overall, only five of the nine product categories tracked
by the agency showed both nominal and real rises in retail
sales in November from a year earlier.
   Retail sales in a couple of key sectors of the economy
suffered declines in both real and nominal terms. Sales of
motor vehicles, parts and tires fell a real 6% and a nominal
3%, while those of electro-technical equipment and musical
instruments were off a real 4% and a nominal 3%.
