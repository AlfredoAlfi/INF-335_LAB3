Business Brief -- Imcera Group:
   Holders Sue Drug Producer,
   Charge It Withheld Data
Imcera said it hadn't yet seen the suit and had no comment
on it.
   The announcement about the plant, operated by Imcera's
Pitman-Moore subsidiary, came Feb. 17 after inspectors from
the Food and Drug Administration cited deficiencies in the
plant's manufacturing.
   After the announcement, the company said it was no longer
"comfortable" with a $1.65-a-share annual earnings estimate
by analysts. It cited "continued pricing pressure" on the
feed-ingredients business at the Pitman-Moore unit. The suit
alleges that Imcera knew about the FDA investigation when it
said it endorsed the analysts' earnings estimate for the
fiscal year ending June 30. That optimism, the suit alleges,
pushed up the stock.
