Business Brief -- International Corona Corp.:
   Exchange of Stock Is Barred
   For Dundee Shareholders
The restructuring left Corona's gold assets intact but
transferred the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company's
interests in oil and gas, industrial minerals and merchant
banking to Dundee, based in Toronto. Corona holders then
received new shares in both companies.
   Under the share exchange proposal, Dundee, which currently
owns about 30% of Corona's stock, offered a portion of these
shares to investors who didn't want to retain a stake in
Dundee. Some holders, mainly gold funds, had been concerned
that they wouldn't be able to sell their Dundee shares in the
market.
