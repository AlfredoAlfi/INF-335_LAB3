Business Brief -- Teledyne Inc.:
   Unit Submits Documents
   Requested by Grand Jury
A spokesman for the diversified manufacturing concern,
based in Los Angeles, declined to discuss other details of
the case. It wasn't clear why the grand jury is
investigating, and no indictments have been handed up.
   In the filing, Teledyne said it "does not possess
sufficient information to determine whether {the company}
will sustain a loss as a result of the investigation, or to
reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss."
   The Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical unit makes unmanned
airplanes and airframes for the Army's Apache helicopter. The
other Teledyne affiliate involved in the investigation is
Teledyne Ryan Electronics, a maker of navigation radar
systems.
