BankAmerica Will Trim
   As Many as 12,000 Jobs
Analysts have speculated that the job loss from the
proposed merger could reach 20,000 or more. BankAmerica said
most of the jobs to be cut will be in California. BankAmerica
has said it expects the merger to cut annual operating
expenses by $1.2 billion within three years.
   BankAmerica hasn't said how many employees it expects to
have when the merger is completed. However, the two banks now
employ a total of 91,000 workers. In addition to the 12,000
jobs BankAmerica says it expects to lose through the merger,
the bank could lose as many as 4,400 through branch
divestitures.
   BankAmerica has promised to shed some 220 branches in five
Western states under an agreement worked out this month with
the Justice Department. Industry analysts estimate that the
average bank branch employs between 10 and 20 workers,
although some of those positions would be retained by
acquiring companies.
