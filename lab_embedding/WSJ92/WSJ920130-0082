Henley Group Holders
   File Suit Challenging
   Recapitalization Plan
The plan is subject to approval by Henley's board,
shareholders and bankers. The company has retained Merrill
Lynch  Co. to evaluate the plan. If the plan goes forward,
it would be completed this summer, and Henley Group would
cease to exist.
   A Henley spokesman said the suit is "routine litigation
and totally without merit."
