Korea Set to Develop
   A Plan for Opening
   Its Financial Markets
In a meeting of senior economic policy makers, presided by
Assistant Finance Minister Lee Hang Kyun, the government
decided to draw up a three-stage market-opening plan to be
completed within the year, officials at the Finance Ministry
said. The plan will detail when and how government
regulations on foreign-exchange transactions, capital
transfers, interest rates and other financial activities
would be lifted, they said.
   Foreign institutions have complained that tight government
controls on financial activities undermine their business
performance.
   The first stage of the plan, to be drawn up by the end of
March and implemented by the end of next year, will call for
the lifting of regulations on foreign-exchange transactions,
officials said. The second phase will be mapped out by late
June for implementation by 1996, and the third phase by late
December for implementation after 1997, they said.
