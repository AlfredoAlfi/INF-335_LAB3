Business Brief -- Student Loan Marketing:
   Court Dismisses Claims
   Of Falsely Inflated Assets
As previously reported, the suit filed in 1990 alleged
that Sallie Mae, the nation's principal purchaser of student
loans, committed fraud by buying invalid student loans to
inflate assets and drive up its stock price. The former
employees worked in Sallie Mae's loan servicing center in
Kansas. Sallie Mae said at the time that the suits were
groundless and that the former employees offered not to file
the suit in return for a cash settlement. It said it rejected
the move.
