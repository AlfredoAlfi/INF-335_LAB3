International Brief -- Delhaize `Le Lion' S.A.:
   Stake Totaling 4.6% Is Sold,
   Raising About $123 Million
Delhaize, which operates supermarkets in Belgium and owns
about 44% of the U.S. supermarket chain Food Lion Inc.,
bought the shares on the market for a total of about 2.7
billion Belgian francs in 1989. The company said then that
the shares were earmarked for a possible partner. A spokesman
said yesterday that Delhaize decided to sell the shares
because it still hadn't found a partner, though the idea of
teaming up with another European supermarket chain hasn't
been abandoned.
