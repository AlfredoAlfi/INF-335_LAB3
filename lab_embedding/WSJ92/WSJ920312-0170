Brazil's Inflation Slows
Foundation director Juarez Rizzieri said prices in
February rose more slowly in all sectors of the economy
except transportation and rents.
   Brazil has promised to reduce inflation to 2% a month by
December. The target is part of an economic plan with the
International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $2.1 billion
stand-by loan.
