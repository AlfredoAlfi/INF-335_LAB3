U.S. Is Challenging
   Magnesium Imports
   From Canada, Norway
Until the final ruling is issued, the U.S. Customs Service
will require a cash deposit equal to the alleged unfair price
advantage on all magnesium imports from Canada and Norway.
For Norsk Hydro Canada Inc. and other Canadian companies
except for Timminco Ltd., whose dumping level was determined
to be insignificant, the dumping margin was set at 32.74%.
The dumping margin for Norsk Hydro AS of Norway and all other
Norwegian companies was set at 8.26%.
   In 1990, magnesium imports from Canada totaled $49
million, and those from Norway totaled $11 million.
   The Commerce Department began an investigation into the
case in September after receiving a petition on behalf of the
domestic industry.
