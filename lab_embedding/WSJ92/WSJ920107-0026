Credit Ratings:
   S&P's Credit Downgrades
   Hit Record Levels in 1991
The debt of Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., General Motors
Corp. and their related entities accounted for $250 billion
in downgrades, nearly half of the dollar volume of corporate
debt downgraded.
   S&P said the recession's effect on the finances of state
and local governments was largely responsible for the
downgrade of eight states in 1991, including California,
which accounted for 34% of the total municipal debt
downgraded. Despite their problems, most municipal credits
are still in the investment-grade category, the rating agency
said.
   The credit quality of corporations continued to slip in
1991. The average rating for U.S. companies is double-B, a
non-investment-grade credit rating.
   "The financial sorcery so prevalent in the merger and
acquisition transactions in the 1980s in reality held no
magic power," said Leo O'Neill, president of S&P Ratings
Group.
