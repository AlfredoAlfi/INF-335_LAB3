Technology:
   Molecular Biosystems
   Named in Patent Suit
   Concerning Test Kits
"This is clearly a violation of our patent," said Thomas
A. Bologna, president of Gen-Probe, because the Molecular
Biosystems kits target RNA. "This is a key technology for us.
It's in all of our products," said Mr. Bologna. Gen-Probe is
a biotechnology concern that went private when it was
acquired in 1989 by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan.
   But Molecular Biosystems President Vincent Frank denied
that, saying the kits target DNA. "We plan to defend
ourselves against this allegation," he said, stressing that
the kits, which are sold to clinical laboratories, comprise
less than 1% of Molecular Biosystem's annual revenue. Mr.
Frank said Molecular Biosystems, a biomedical concern, has
notified Gen-Probe that it believes one of Gen-Probe's
products is a patent infringement. It is considering its own
lawsuit, Mr. Frank said.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Molecular Biosystems stock closed at $29.75, down
$1.25.
   Both companies said they have been in discussions over the
issue for months. Gen-Probe seeks in its lawsuit to recover
Molecular Biosystems' profit from the sale of the kits, a
figure Gen-Probe has yet to determine, plus treble damages.
