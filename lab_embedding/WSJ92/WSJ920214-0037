Honda, Backed by Canada,
   To Appeal Customs Ruling
While the back duties are a tiny portion of Honda's sales,
the Customs ruling is important because it could compel Honda
as well as Toyota Motor Corp. to increase the North American
content of cars produced in this continent.
   Mr. Whitlock charged that a recent Customs Service audit
of Honda Civics imported from Honda's Alliston, Ontario,
plant "changed the rules" by disqualifying various components
in those vehicles from being classified as of North American
origin. Cars traded between the U.S. and Canada must have at
least 50% North American content to qualify for duty-free
treatment under the U.S.-Canadian free-trade accord.
   The Canadian government, stepping into this politically
sensitive quarrel, asked the Bush administration for
"consultations" on the ruling under a dispute-settling
provision of this accord.
