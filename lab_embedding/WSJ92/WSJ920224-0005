Japan Vehicle Output
   Fell 1.5% in January,
   Second Drop in a Row
As long as economic growth remains slow in Japan and
abroad, this general downtrend will continue, the association
said. It said that Japanese consumers are hesitant about
spending, and that interest rates are still high enough to be
a factor in deterring potential buyers.
   In the latest reporting month, production of passenger
cars slid 1.3% from the year-earlier period to 766,612 units,
with output of small cars dropping 10.6% to 494,099 units.
But production of medium-sized to large-sized cars rose 33.5%
to 210,458 units.
   The association said small-car sales are particularly
vulnerable to the economic slowdown and high interest rates,
while wealthier consumers buying larger cars aren't as
hesitant about spending. The industry group has repeatedly
said that the long-term trend is for Japanese consumers to
buy bigger cars.
   Truck output in January declined 2.4% to 263,105 units.
Production of mediumsized trucks dropped 3.7% to 94,723 units
while that of small-sized trucks climbed 2.5% to 93,360
units. Mini-truck production fell 6.4% to 75,022 units.
   Bus production increased 25% to 3,910 units, with
large-sized buses registering a 26.7% gain to 1,649 units and
small-sized buses a 23.8% rise to 2,261 units.
