Business Brief:
   Three Institutions
   Acquire $1.25 Billion
   Of FarWest Deposits
Northeast Savings, Hartford, Conn., purchased $186.9
million of deposits from four branches, while International
Savings Bank, San Diego, got $41.7 million of deposits from
one branch. The 25 acquired offices are to reopen today.
   The three acquiring institutions paid a total of $3.7
million in premiums to acquire the deposits, and purchased
$265 million in assets from FarWest. The RTC will pay off
about $530 million of FarWest's insured brokered and
money-desk deposits, as well as $120 million of insured
deposits from three branches that won't reopen.
   The agency will advance an estimated $983.4 million to the
acquirers and retain about $1.48 billion of FarWest's assets.
The RTC expects to recover some of the advance by selling the
assets, and estimated the transaction will ultimately cost
the government $831 million.
