Farm Credit System
   Says Profit Rose 23%
   In the Fourth Quarter
The net interest margin -- essentially the difference
between the interest a lender pays on deposits and interest
it receives from borrowers -- was bolstered in part by the
replacement of higher-cost debt with lower-cost debt during
the year, because of normal refinancings of maturing debt and
one bank's repurchases of higher-cost debt in late 1990.
Additionally, reduced loan-pricing pressures helped the
margins, the system said.
   The system, which received a federal bailout in the
mid-1980s after being driven to the brink of insolvency by
the agricultural sector's slump, said the credit quality of
its loan portfolio continues to improve, in part because its
borrowers are benefiting from relatively high levels of farm
cash income in recent years.
