ATT Asks for Law
   On Long-Distance
   Sales by Baby Bells
In his testimony, Mr. Allen asserted that the Justice
Department "has lost its memory and its compass" and that it
can't be trusted to uphold the restrictions on the Baby
Bells. He cited requests for consent decree waivers-which
received Justice Department support-that could give the Bells
some latitude to enter the manufacturing and long-distance
businesses.
   The chairman of the panel, Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas),
indicated that legislation may be introduced soon. But what
provisions would be included is uncertain.
   For the first time, ATT has joined a coalition of
newspapers, consumer groups, manufacturing groups and
information providers who have called for comprehensive
legislation that would curb the Bells' ability to enter new
markets.
   Last summer, the federal court here allowed the Bells to
enter the information services business. Since then,
newspaper groups and information providers have been pushing
for legislation that would bar the Baby Bells from owning the
content of computerized information services they carry over
their networks.
