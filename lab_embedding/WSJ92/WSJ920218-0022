GenRad Inc. Reports
   Loss of $5.3 Million
   For Fourth Quarter
Domestic demand for the company's equipment "has been
depressed since mid-1989, but the international market had
remained relatively strong," said GenRad spokesman Raymond F.
McNulty, who noted that about 55% of the company's revenue
now comes from overseas buyers. "In the third quarter of
1991, though, the international market started to soften and
that has hurt us."
   In the past two years, GenRad has posted losses. In fiscal
1991, the company had a loss of $39.1 million, or $2.22 a
share, which included a third-quarter restructuring charge of
$23 million for severance, write-downs and reserves for
excess facilities in the weak Silicon Valley real-estate
market. In 1990, GenRad had a loss of $21.1 million, or $1.22
a share, which included a gain of $5.1 million and a charge
of $10 million for restructuring and write-offs. Revenue was
$156.4 million in the just-finished fiscal year compared with
$179.3 million in fiscal 1990.
   Mr. McNulty pointed out that parts of GenRad's balance
sheet have not been weakened. Cash and cash equivalents were
$15.5 million at year's end, up from $12.9 million at the end
of 1990.
