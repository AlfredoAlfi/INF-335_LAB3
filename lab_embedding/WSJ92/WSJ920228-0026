Business Brief -- Courtaulds Textiles PLC:
   Year's Pretax Profit Rose
   4.7%, Aided by Cost Cuts
The fabric company's results were in line with market
expectations, but its chief executive officer, Martin Taylor,
was downbeat in his comments on business conditions.
   "The slight improvement in U.K. market conditions last
autumn hasn't come to much," Mr. Taylor said, "and the
volatility of the U.S. dollar is a source of uncertainty. We
are not assuming that the trading environment will become
more helpful to us during 1992."
   Mr. Taylor was more positive on the company's performance.
"Courtaulds Textiles is continuing to weather the recession
well," he said. "The 1991 results show the benefits of prompt
action to cut costs and of a vigorous approach to
working-capital management."
   Operating profit in 1991 was #53.2 million, compared with
#53.4 million in 1990, which benefited from #400,000 in
associated earnings.
