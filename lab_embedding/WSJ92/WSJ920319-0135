Pepper...and Salt
Out sailing I hear talk of sheets
   That don't go on a bed,
   And I get references to shrouds
   That are not for the dead,
   And then there are the painters
   Without an artistic hope.
   After all this I only wish
   They'd call a rope a rope.

   As the Germ Turns
                                                                                                       

   The symptoms gradually unfold --
   The misery's begun.
   I hope it's just a common cold,
   And not a special one]
