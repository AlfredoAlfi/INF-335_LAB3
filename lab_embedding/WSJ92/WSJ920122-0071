Marketing Brief -- Meredith Corp.:
   Fiscal Second-Period Profit
   Declined 53% to $4.7 Million
The latest net more than doubled the year-earlier profit
from continuing operations of $1.6 million. Those results
were hurt by a $6 million reserve, related to a pending legal
settlement.
   Meredith said the quarter benefited from "significant
improvement" at its book group, as well as a strong showing
by its direct mail operations, where results were bolstered
by restructuring.
   Those bright spots were offset in part by a decline in
advertising pages and newsstand sales for the company's
Ladies' Home Journal magazine, as well as by "soft national
and local advertising revenues" at its broadcasting business,
the company said.
