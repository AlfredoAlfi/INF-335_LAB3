   Seek-Destroy Mission
   Against HIV Bearers
No, the greatest economic cost comes from lost
productivity. According to a federally funded study published
in the January 1987 Public Health Reports, 1985 saw $3.9
billion in lost productivity due to illness and death from
AIDS, as opposed to medical costs of $630 million.
   Despite the greater medical costs involved, no employers I
know of are also seeking medical data that will enable them
to exclude, or even fire, people with heart disease, diabetes
or cancer. Mr. Clark's piece is another demonstration of
society's obsessive, irrational seek-and-destroy mission
against people with HIV. Employers should be looking for ways
to keep people with HIV alive, well and in the work force --
not drive them out.
