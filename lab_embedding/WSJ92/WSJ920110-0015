   Arjo Wiggins Mill Expansion
A company spokeswoman in London said she didn't know
whether the expansion would create new jobs.

the leading U.S. producer of thermal facsimile paper. The
company is 39% owned by France's Arjomari-Prioux S.A., which
itself is being absorbed by French food group Saint Louis
