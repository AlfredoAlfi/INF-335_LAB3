Ten Japanese Firms to Pay
   U.S. in Bid-Rigging Case
The bid-rigging scheme was uncovered by Air Force
investigators after contracting officials noticed a
suspicious pattern of bids submitted by the Japanese
companies.
   Only two firms, NEC Information and Daimei Denwa Kogyo,
received contracts to operate and maintain telecommunications
equipment. The others submitted high bids to ensure that NEC
Information would win most of the contracts, the Justice
Department said.
   Besides Daimei Denwa Kogyo, the other firms involved in
the settlement were: Nippon Comsys Corp., Toyo Denki Tsushin
Kogyo Co., Sanwa-Daiei Electric Construction Co., J-Cos
Corp., Shinko Tsushin Kensetsu, Ikeno Tsuken Co., Daiwa
Tsushin Kensetsu Co., Daiko Denshi Tsushin Co. and Fujitsu
Business Systems Ltd.
