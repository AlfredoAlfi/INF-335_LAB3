Business Brief -- Thomas  Betts Corp.:
   Profit for Fourth Quarter
   Fell 13%; Improvement Seen
For the year, earnings were flat at $48.4 million, or
$2.84 a share. The 1990 results included a restructuring
charge of $9 million, or 43 cents a share. Sales for the year
were off 5% to $566.4 million from $599 million.
   Kevin T. Dunnigan, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the recent acquisition of FL Industries Holdings Inc.,
another maker of electrical products, should put Thomas 
Betts's 1992 sales over $1 billion. He said profitability
should accelerate in the next several years with the
increased efficiency resulting from the acquisition.
