Two Ex-Stockbrokers
   Arraigned on Charges
   Of Securities Fraud
Ms. Dedeaux, 38 years old, admitted that she diverted more
than $2 million from the accounts of 13 customers by
preparing false documents that purported to authorize
withdrawals. The money was later deposited into accounts
controlled by Ms. Dedeaux, said assistant U.S. attorney
Harriet M. Rolnick.
   Thomas J. Nolan, attorney for Ms. Dedeaux, called the plea
"a step toward rehabilitating the situation" involving her.
   Separately, Craig F. Newhouse answered a federal
information accusing him of fraudulently inducing customers
at PaineWebber Inc., which is a unit of PaineWebber Group
Inc., and Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. to invest $965,000
in a company in which he had an ownership interest. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Christine E. Cleveland said Mr. Newhouse is
slated to enter a guilty plea on two counts of securities
fraud April 13.
   Mr. Newhouse, 43, allegedly failed to disclose his
interest in American Time Inc., Marina Del Rey, and is
accused of falsely telling customers that stock and notes
issued by the company were recommended by PaineWebber.
   His lawyer, H Thomas Fehn, said Mr. Newhouse "has
cooperated completely with the government's investigation and
has agreed to plead guilty to the two charges set forth."
