International:
   Japan to Decide in March
   On Allowing Rice Imports
Top government officials have been hinting recently that
Japan was preparing to accept tariffication to help bring the
GATT talks to a successful conclusion. Over the weekend,
Kyodo News Service quoted unnamed government sources as
saying flatly that Mr. Miyazawa would accept tariffication.
The report couldn't be confirmed.
   Japan has always insisted that rice is a staple food and
that self-sufficiency must be maintained for security
reasons.
