   AMA Offers Plan to Cover
   HIV-Positive Physicians
The AMA plan pays a lump sum immediately after an insured
doctor tests positive for HIV. Practicing physicians can
apply for payments of $500,000, $250,000 or $150,000;
resident physicians are eligible for $250,000 or $150,000;
and medical students can apply for $50,000.
   The association's AMA Insurance Agency Inc. unit
test-marketed the insurance plan in 14 states beginning last
June. The AMA said the plan is currently available in all but
six states.
