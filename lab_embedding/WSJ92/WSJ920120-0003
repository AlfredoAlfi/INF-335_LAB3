   Of Magazine Group
Mr. Packer currently owns the 66 magazine titles through
his private company, Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd. The
magazine titles include Australian Women's Weekly, Woman's
Day, the Bulletin, People Australian Business Monthly, Cleo
and Mode.
   Ord Minnett Securities Ltd., broker to Consolidated Press,
distributed the prospectus to funds managers and investment
companies Friday, with strict confidentiality requirements.

comment.
   The magazine sale follows several other asset sales by Mr.
Packer in the past 12 months. If it goes ahead, the proceeds
from asset sales will be in excess of A$1 billion. The asset
sales program has fueled speculation that Mr. Packer is
looking for another major acquisition, and attention has
focused on media assets owned by the Maxwell group in
Britain.
   Consolidated Press's profit, before interest and tax, for
the year ending June 30 is projected to be A$112.4 million,
up 22% from A$92.4 million last fiscal year. Consolidated
Press forecasts a dividend of 29.8 cents a share.
