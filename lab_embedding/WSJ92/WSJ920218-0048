Capitol Bancorp's Weiner
   Convicted of Racketeering
The two counts of racketeering pertain to Mr. Weiner's
involvement, by virtue of hiring the collectors, in a larger
loan-sharking operation that the collectors were part of.
Also, the counts involve Mr. Weiner allowing that scheme --
which lent $2.5 million to 400 borrowers at rates as high as
7% a week -- to operate from premises he owned.
   Mr. Weiner is free on $5,000 bail pending sentencing April
30.
