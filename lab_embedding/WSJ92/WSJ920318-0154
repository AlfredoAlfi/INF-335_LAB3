Sun City to Report
   Earnings of $91,000
   For Fiscal 4th Period
Last year, the company also acquired three smaller food
service businesses, and, Mr. Avchen said, "because we became
a little more aggressive in the food service marketing
business . . . we were able to get a much better return on
our sales."
   For the year, Sun City expects to report net income of
$350,000, or 23 cents a share, compared with a loss of
$353,000, or 22 cents a share, the previous year. Revenue
declined 3% to $68 million from $70.5 million. Earnings for
the 1992 fourth quarter and year include a nonrecurring loss
of $47,088, or three cents a share, from disposition of
business assets. In addition, fiscal 1991 earnings were
restated to reflect a 3-for-1 stock split on July 26, 1991.
   As of Jan. 31, the company had 1,555,000 shares of common
stock outstanding, compared with 1,580,000 shares a year
earlier (1,053,000 shares before the split).
   Avchen said Sun City is considering acquiring other small
food service companies in the current fiscal year in an
effort to expand its geographic presence along the East
Coast, as well as its product lines and customer base.
