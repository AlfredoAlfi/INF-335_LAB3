Credit Ratings
HOSPITAL CORP. OF AMERICA (Nashville, Tenn.) -- Standard 
Poor's Corp. said it raised its ratings on Hospital Corp.'s
senior unsecured debt to single-B-plus from single-B-minus
and on subordinated debt to single-B-plus from triple-C-plus.
The rating agency also said it removed the ratings from
CreditWatch, where they were placed June 19, 1991, with
positive implications. SP said Hospital Corp.'s implied
senior secured debt rating is double-B. Meanwhile, SP said
the rating for the subordinated debt of HealthTrust Inc.-The
Hospital Co., which is guaranteed by Hospital Corp. on a
senior unsecured basis, is raised to single-B-plus from
single-B and removed from CreditWatch. The changes affect
approximately $1.9 billion of debt. SP said proceeds from
various transactions and asset sales have contributed to a
significant reduction in the debt burden assumed with
Hospital Corp.'s $5.1 billion leveraged buy-out in March
1989. But the rating agency said that, while credit measures
have improved, funds from operations still provide relatively
thin coverage of fixed charges.
