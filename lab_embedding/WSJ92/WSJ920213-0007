Letters to the Editor:
   Orthodox Church
   In Czarist Russia
-- The Russian Orthodox Church has never been a driving
force of Russian imperialism; in fact, the very concept of
"Russian Orthodox chauvinism" constitutes a curious oxymoron.
Perhaps the greatest tragedy of that church, both in czarist
and in Soviet times, has been its timidity and its inability
to stand up forcefully to political manipulation and
religious persecution. Unlike Western Roman Catholicism,
Russian Orthodoxy is based more on introspection (kynosis)
than on institutional action. This quality has cost the
church dearly.
   -- Speaking out against "the evils of Western culture" is
not somehow unique to Russian Orthodoxy. Most mainstream
churches, notably the Roman Catholic Church, routinely
condemn the supposed moral degradation of Western
civilization, and generally take strong positions on issues
common to our culture: pornography, abortion, extramarital
sex, etc. The historical peculiarities of Russia lend these
issues an "East vs. West" perspective, not the Russian
Orthodox Church itself.
