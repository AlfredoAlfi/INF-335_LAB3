International Brief -- Fuji Bank:
   Bank Issues Sharply Lower
   Estimate of Fiscal Year Net
In the prior fiscal year, which ended in March 1991, Fuji
Bank reported pretax profit of 205.91 billion yen, net profit
of 119.61 billion yen and revenue of 4.132 trillion yen. If
the revised predictions prove accurate, Fuji Bank would see
fiscal 1991 pretax profit fall by 32% from a year earlier,
and net plunge 75%. Revenue would decline 8.0%.
   For the prior fiscal year, Fuji Bank reported a decline in
pretax profit of 31% from the year before, and a 19% decline
in net. Revenue climbed by 15%.
   A spokesman said the bank lowered its projections because
it decided to add about 100 billion yen to a taxable reserve
account for protection against bad loans. In particular, the
reserves will likely be needed because of the forged
documents allegedly issued by a former Fuji Bank branch
manager in one of last year's prominent financial scandals.
The manager was fired when the bank said he issued fraudulent
receipts for deposits, which associates then used as
collateral to gain financing elsewhere.
