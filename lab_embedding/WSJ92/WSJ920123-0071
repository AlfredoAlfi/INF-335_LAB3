Letters to the Editor:
   Mobutu Thugs Master
   Of a Circus of Death
On Dec. 4, the day President Mobutu's mandate came to an
end, large street demonstrations were expected. They did not
occur because leaders of the opposition instructed people not
to leave their homes, knowing they would be massacred in the
streets. Had blood flowed, the U.S. government might have
come out strongly against Mr. Mobutu's violent repression of
the population. The fact is that the Bush administration
continues its silent observation as Zairians are subjected to
slow death rather than a fast one at the hands of Mr.
Mobutu's thugs.
   I find it difficult to understand why President Bush fails
to appreciate that his personal silence in the face of the
Zairian tragedy perpetuates this tyranny.
