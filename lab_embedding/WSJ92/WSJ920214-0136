   Special to The Wall Street Journal
In 1993-94, the demand will rise 2.4% to 367.79 million
kiloliters, compared with 1.0% a year earlier.
   The projections were made based on the assumption that
Japan's gross national products will grow 3.0% in 1992-93 and
3.4% in 1993-94, compared with 3.6% for the current fiscal
year.
   The institute also predicts that crude oil prices will
average $19 a barrel in fiscal 1992 and $20 a barrel in
fiscal 1993, while the currency exchange rate will stay at
127 yen against the U.S. dollar in 1992-93 and at 126 yen in
the following year.
