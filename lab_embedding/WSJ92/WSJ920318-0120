Builders Who Paid
   Kickbacks Must Build
   Homes for the Poor
"A taste of jail" for the men would "accomplish almost
nothing," said Judge Barry at the sentencing. "I envision
this (sentence) as making a difference in people's lives."
   The four builders had all pleaded guilty to paying a total
of more than $200,000 in kickbacks to William Spagnoli,
former senior vice president of City Federal Savings Bank in
Newark, in exchange for project loans.
   The sentencing arrangement was proposed by Eric Breslin,
an attorney for builder Frank DiMisa, of Rumson, N.J. The
other builders are Mr. DiMisa's two partners at McCampbell
Development Corp., Harry Kantor, of Holmdel, N.J., and Victor
Losquadro, of Freehold, N.J.; and Ronald Acquavia, of
Holmdel.
   In addition to fines and probation, Judge Barry sentenced
Mr. DiMisa to four months of full-time work with the
organization, followed by another 1,100 hours over the next
two years. Mr. Acquavia was ordered to put in two months
full-time, plus 700 hours. The other two were directed to
work 400 hours each.
