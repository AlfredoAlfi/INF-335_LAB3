   Real-Estate Portfolio
   Has Solid Foundation
TIAA's mortgage does include a provision requiring the
payment of additional interest, but only from increases in
rent during the latter part of the loan term. Silverstein
Properties retains 100% of the ownership of Seven World Trade
Center.
   With regard to Mall of America, this project is expected
to open on schedule in August 1992. TIAA's extensive market
and financial analysis and stringent underwriting criteria
indicate that Mall of America is a well-conceived,
economically sound project that will perform favorably over a
long-term investment horizon, which is suitable given the
project's scope. Furthermore, TIAA's outstanding commitment
to Mall of America is an equity position, not a permanent
loan, as your article reported. When funded, the project will
not be subject to any debt financing.
   The vast majority of TIAA's $20 billion in mortgage and
real-estate investments are current in their debt service,
and generating anticipated attractive yields. On an overall
basis, TIAA's mortgage and realestate portfolio currently
yields better than 9.5%, a very respectable return given the
current interest-rate environment.
