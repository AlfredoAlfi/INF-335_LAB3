Seibels Bruce Group
   Agrees to Be Acquired
   By Lincoln National
Seibels will be merged into Lincoln's American States
Insurance property-casualty unit. Under terms, Lincoln said
it will pay about 55% of the purchase price with Lincoln
shares, with the rest in cash.
   The planned acquisition is subject, among other things, to
signing of a definitive pact, regulatory clearance and
approval by Seibels shareholders.
   Seibels had a 1991 loss of $21.2 million, or $2.76 a
share, after adding $18.4 million to its loan-loss reserves
in the fourth period "as the result of an actuarial review."
Following that move, plans to raise $20 million by selling a
stake to an investment group led by Randolph Updyke were
scrapped.
   Yesterday, Seibels said it had also "mutually agreed" to
end a separate stock-purchase agreement, under which Policy
Management Systems Corp. had been expected to provide a $5
million cash infusion by purchasing shares at $7.25 apiece.
   Also, "in light of the pending merger," Seibels said, it
now won't pay a dividend for the quarter ending March 31; it
had been paying out nine cents a share quarterly.
