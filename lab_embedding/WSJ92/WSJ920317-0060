Business Brief -- Nu-Med Inc.:
   Sharply Wider Loss Posted
   For Fiscal Third Quarter
The company also said it can't pay debenture interest of
$5.3 million due this month, and is in the process of
obtaining financing to make the payments within the 30-day
grace period. The financing would be subject to the sale of
some psychiatric facilities. Nu-Med warned if it can't get
the financing, it has no alternate source.
   Nu-Med also said it won't pursue the previously announced
public offering of stock of its PsychGroup Inc. subsidiary
"because of market conditions," but instead is negotiating to
sell part of it.
