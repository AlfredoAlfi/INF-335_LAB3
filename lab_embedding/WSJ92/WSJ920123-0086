Letters to the Editor:
   Sweet Scent of Profit
   Is Blooming Abroad
For U.S. growers to bemoan competition in the home market
without alluding to their role in the export market is akin
to the Big Three auto makers crying the blues over unfair
competition from Japanese car makers without ever mentioning
their own overseas operations and sales.
   In mathematics there are two sides to every equation. This
also holds true in economics, where one must consider both
exports and imports. "Where have all the flowers gone?" Some
have gone to the export market.
