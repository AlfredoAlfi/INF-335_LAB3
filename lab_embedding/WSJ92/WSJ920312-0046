Service Merchandise's
   Two Former Officials
   Indicted for Scheme
The indictment alleges that the defendants generated false
invoices, mostly for purported security services, and
obtained payments, which went to Mr. Levy. Attorneys for both
men said their clients will plead innocent to the charges.
   Service Merchandise, which has been cooperating in the
two-year investigation, said it expects "a significant part"
of the loss from the alleged scheme to be covered by
insurance.
   Last week, Noble L. Brymer, a former consultant to the
company, was charged with one count of conspiracy for
submitting false invoices for security services as part of
the scheme. Mr. Brymer is expected to plead guilty and
cooperate with the government's case, the U.S. Attorney's
Office in Nashville said. Mr. Brymer's attorney, Vincent
Wehby, confirmed that "an early resolution" of the case is
expected.
