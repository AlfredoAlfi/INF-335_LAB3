Business Brief -- Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd.:
   Net Increased 30% in 1991,
   But Pretax Profit Declined
However, the Japanese maker of tires and sporting goods
said pretax profit slipped 1.7% to 11.55 billion yen from
11.75 billion yen because sales weren't able to keep up with
growing costs amid a slump in the global tire market.
   The company predicted that the tire market will remain
difficult during the current year, but said it expects pretax
profit in 1992 to climb 3.9% to 12 billion yen, with net
falling 17% to 6 billion yen and sales rising 6.1% to 270
billion yen.
   In 1991, the company's tire division posted sales of 163.6
billion yen, an increase of 1.3% from the previous year's
level. Because of healthy demand for such items as golf and
tennis equipment, sales of sporting goods rose 7.5% to 70.18
billion yen, Sumitomo said.
