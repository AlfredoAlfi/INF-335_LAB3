International Business Brief -- TDK Corp.:
   Pretax Profit Dropped 23%
   In the Fiscal Third Quarter
Slowing consumer demand in both Japan and abroad caused
sales of recording media to drop 5.3% to 49.65 billion yen
from a year earlier, while sales of electronic materials and
components declined 4.4% to 90.83 billion yen, the company
said. Overseas sales dropped 4.7% to 68.29 billion yen and
accounted for 49% of total sales.
   A TDK spokeswoman said the company expects pretax profit
for the year ending March 31 to be about 20% lower than the
$40 billion yen forecast in November. The earlier estimate
represented a decline of 11% from the prior year's profit.
   Sales, however, are expected to be "only slightly lower"
than previous forecasts, the spokeswoman said.
