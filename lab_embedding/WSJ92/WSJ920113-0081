   A `Significant Loss'
   In Fourth Quarter
The interior furnishings and building products
manufacturer declined to discuss the effect of the charge on
1991 annual results. It will report final fourth-quarter and
annual earnings Jan. 27.
   In 1990, fourth-quarter earnings were $4.7 million,
resulting in no per-share earnings after payment of preferred
dividends. Yearly earnings were $141 million, or $3.12 a
share, on 38.9 million shares outstanding.
   An Armstrong spokesman said about half of the $16 million
pertains to the closing of three "non-core" businesses that
he refused to identify. Other significant items contributing
to the loss include severance payments and early retirement
incentives in those businesses and others, and the company's
inability to use its foreign tax credits because of the
anticipated loss.
   In the first nine months, Armstrong's earnings fell 56% to
$60.2 million, or $1.23 a share, from a year-earlier $136.3
million, or $3.10 a share. Sales fell 3% to $1.87 billion.
