   Texas Concern Settles Suit
   Over Its Self-Tender Offer
When it converted to a corporation from a partnership last
year, the cafeteria concern promised to buy back two million
of its Class A shares for $4 a share by last September.
However, it ran into financial problems and never began the
tender offer.
   The company, based in Lubbock, Texas, said it believes it
could have defended itself in the lawsuit, but decided to
settle because of the cost and management commitment required
to litigate. The company also said the self-tender offer
remains a "continuing obligation" of the company.
