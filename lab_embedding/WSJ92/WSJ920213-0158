Addington to Sell Kanawha Unit
Addington said proceeds from the transaction, as well as a
related sale of $8.5 million in certain coal mining
machinery, will more than offset an expected $10 million net
write-off in the fourth quarter for the closure of
Addington's western Kentucky coal mining operations. In the
1990 fourth quarter, Addington had a net loss of $2.4
million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $63.5 million.
   Pittston also agreed to buy as many as 1.8 million tons of
coal from one of Addington's mines in West Virginia for a
purchase price of $27 a ton through 1994. In addition,
Addington agreed to purchase about 2.3 million tons of coal
from one of Pittston's mines in eastern Kentucky through
February 1996 at a price of $25 a ton, with a 3% price
escalation each year.
   Addington said it has also entered into an option
agreement with Marion Mining Co., Marion, Ill., for the sale
of its southern Illinois Mining Co. subsidiary. Terms weren't
disclosed.
