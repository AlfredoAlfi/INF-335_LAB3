Twin Nuclear Reactors
   Are Shut by Baltimore
   Gas  Electric Co.
Because of moderate temperatures, the company's other
plants have been able to generate sufficient power to cover
the shortage. But if demand increases, the company said, it
may have to buy power from utilities in Maryland,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
   The Calvert Cliffs plant has had two extended shut-downs
since 1988, and the company currently is in litigation about
whether customers should absorb the higher costs of power
purchased from other utilities.
