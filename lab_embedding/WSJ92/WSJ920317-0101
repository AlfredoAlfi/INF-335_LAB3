Transit Employees'
   Strike Halts System
   In the Pittsburgh Area
On Saturday night, the Port Authority offered the workers
a one-year contract, which would have expired November 30.
The contract would have would raised hourly pay as much as 63
cents an hour to $16.28 and continued the benefits provided
under the previous three-year contract, which expired last
Nov. 30. The workers, represented by Local 85 of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, rejected the offer. About 96% of
union members voted to strike.
   A union spokesman said the Port Authority had turned down
several union proposals. The Port Authority last week
rejected a state fact-finder's recommendation, which the
transit agency said would have cost it $75 million. A
spokeswoman for the Port Authority, which has a $210 million
annual operating budget, said wages for its transit operators
are in the top decile in the nation.
   The last Pittsburgh transit strike, in 1976, lasted five
days.
