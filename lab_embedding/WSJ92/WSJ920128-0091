Letters to the Editor:
   Da Vinci Book Review
   Insults Gays, Lesbians
More seriously, he implies that homosexuality is a moral
failing. Following a two-paragraph discussion of da Vinci's
sexuality, Mr. Holt begins the next paragraph with, "A rather
more serious moral failing. . . ." To imply that
homosexuality is a moral failing is an insult to da Vinci's
exuberant sexuality and to all gay men and lesbians.
   I expected better from your publication, and hope not to
see such lapses in the future.
