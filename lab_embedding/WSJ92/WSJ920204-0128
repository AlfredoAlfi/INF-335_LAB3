   Jobs Exported to Japan
   Along With Our Logs
There was a time when national forests supposedly were
managed on a sustained and multiple-use basis. After all,
these lands belong to all of us who like to hike, camp, fish,
hunt and enjoy the solitude of nature. Then, of course, there
are the original inhabitants -- fish, mammals and birds -- to
consider.
   The Reagan administration deemed that national forests
should be used mainly for timber production and the Bush
people are in lock step with that philosophy. Overcutting the
forests means that old-growth timber disappears faster,
forcing old-growth mills to close and lay off workers.
   We should be more than a colony for Japan. Instead of
sending it our natural resources we should be sending it our
finished goods. Loggers can retrain for the resulting mill
jobs.
   Our forests are not wood factories. Other species besides
loggers depend upon their natural bounty. Man is only a
steward for the future. We need to protect the future by
preserving the present.
