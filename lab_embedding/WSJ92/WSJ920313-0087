Postal Service Acted
   Illegally in Trimming
   Hours, Board Rules
The case arose from an order by Congress that the Postal
Service find $430 million in savings in the two fiscal years
beginning Oct. 1, 1987. The agency responded by cutting post
office window hours, closing some offices on Saturdays and
eliminating Sunday mail collections and processing.
   The NLRB ruled that even though savings were mandated by
Congress, the Postal Service labor contract required that
cuts in work hours had to be bargained with the union. The
board reversed a ruling by an administrative law judge, who
agreed with the agency's contention that the congressional
action meant that collective bargaining wasn't required.
