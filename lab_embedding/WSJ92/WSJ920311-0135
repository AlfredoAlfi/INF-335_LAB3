Letters to the Editor:
   A `Master Race'
   Bears Watching
-- The Japanese have long considered themselves to be a
"master race." As for their competitive instincts, they are
well-developed. And make no mistake -- the Japanese will do
whatever it takes to be No. 1.
   -- The Bush administration's attempt to downplay the
recent insults of top Japanese officials proves it still does
not grasp the situation. To show charity toward Japan is to
fail to take that nation seriously. The U.S. is in serious
peril of becoming a nation of low-paid, unskilled workers who
have no choice but to work in the menial jobs for which Mr.
Miyazawa believes we are qualified. Our top priority, above
defense and the environment, should be better education and
job training. The only way we can hope to compete is by
creating an even better trained work force that produces
superior goods and services.
