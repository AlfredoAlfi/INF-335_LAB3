Business Brief -- Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co.:
   Insurer Eases the Guidelines
   Governing Hardship Funds
The company said it will contact approximately 1,200
people whose hardship applications were previously denied in
order to give them an opportunity to reapply under the new
rules.
   Distribution of Mutual Benefit's funds were partially
frozen in July after state insurance regulators seized
control of the ailing insurer. Since then, policyholders have
been unable to withdraw their funds, with the exception of
hardship cases. Mutual Benefit had continued to pay death and
health benefit claims and regular annuity payments.
