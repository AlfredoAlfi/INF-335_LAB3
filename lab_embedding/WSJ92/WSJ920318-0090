International Brief -- Petrogal S.A.:
   Panel Accepts Total's Offer
   In Company's Privatization
The successful bidders have nine months to acquire an
additional 26% of Petrogal at the same share price, gaining a
51% stake. Petrogal controls 55% of the Portuguese retail
market for oil products. The Franco-Portuguese consortium was
the only bidder for Petrogal, Portugal's biggest commercial
enterprise.
   Industry Minister Luis Mira Amaral said the sale was
successful, but market sources said the lack of competition
for Petrogal dashed government hopes that competing bidders
would push up the price.
