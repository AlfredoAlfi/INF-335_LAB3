   From North Carolina
OSHA assumed authority for some important parts of the
state program in the wake of a fire in September that killed
25 poultry-plant workers in Hamlet, N.C. OSHA now handles new
worker health or safety complaints and complaints referred by
state officials. The federal agency also monitors state
investigations of catastrophes, including any accidents that
involve worker fatalities or the hospitalization of five or
more workers.
   North Carolina is one of 25 states and territories that
run state occupational safety and health programs under
delegated authority from OSHA. The federal agency directly
regulates programs in other states.
