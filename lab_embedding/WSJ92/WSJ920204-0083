Business Brief -- McGraw-Hill Inc.:
   Fourth-Period Net Fell 12%
   As Slump in Ads Continued
The information and publication services segment, the
largest business unit, reported a 33% drop in operating
profit for the quarter and a 35% drop for the year.
McGraw-Hill attributed the decline to the continued weakness
in advertising, construction and computer markets.
   Operating profits for educational and professional
publishing were down 27% for the year, reflecting the
postponement of a legal series, cutbacks in library funding
and growing white-collar unemployment. The company reported
gains in its financial services segment, where profits were
up 17%, and its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill joint venture. Profits
for the broadcast unit dropped 23% in the year.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
McGraw-Hill shares rose 12.5 cents to $58.875.
