Business Brief -- Centocor Inc.:
   Firm Is Exercising Option
   To Buy Out Some Partners
Centocor Partners II was formed in 1986 and raised $55
million to fund development of Centocor's products, HA 1A, or
Centoxin, to fight toxic blood infections, and cancer imaging
agents.
   Centocor had announced in December 1990 that it intended
to exercise its options to purchase Centocor Partners II and
another research and development partnership for imaging
products. It took a $115.5 million charge in the 1990 fourth
quarter for acquired research and development of the
partnerships. The charge included the $12.4 million
distribution, so there will be no current charge against
earnings, a Centocor spokesman said.
