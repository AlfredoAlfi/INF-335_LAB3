Employers Who Retaliate
   May Face Treble Damages
Earlier efforts by the workers to secure back pay
backfired. After complaining, they collected some $3 million
in back wages in 1990 but were allegedly coerced by the
company to return the checks. Those who refused were fired
and shipped back to China. Such alleged retaliations are
subject to treble damages, the court ruled, in a Fair Labor
Standards Act action.
