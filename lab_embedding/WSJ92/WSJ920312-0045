International:
   Five Foreign Groups Win
   Malaysian Phone Contract
Despite increasingly sharp criticism from
telecommunications industry executives and political critics
over alleged favoritism and interference in the tender
process, Datuk Anwar said the government's selections won't
be reversed as long as the five foreign-led groups comply
with conditions specified in the letters of intent.
   Among the ministry's conditions are that four of the
groups must match Ericsson's low bid and that all the
equipment must be mutually compatible. Datuk Anwar said that
neither the government nor Telekom Malaysia Bhd., Malaysia's
recently privatized and publicly listed telephone company,
would bear any expense in adapting the five groups' equipment
to each other or to the existing telephone system.
