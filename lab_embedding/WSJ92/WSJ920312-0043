will suspend sales of government-owned cheese and nonfat dry

   Meanwhile, the department projected this year's citrus
crop at 11.8 million tons, up 7% from last season's crop and
up 1% from last month's forecast. Orange production was
projected at 8.72 million tons, up 2% from the Feb. 1
forecast and up 11% from last season.
