Pepper...and Salt
I've eaten all my vitamins From
   A right through to zinc,
   I've eaten everything I should
   Except the kitchen sink.
   So what you see before you
   Is the best that I can be,
   And if you have complaints with that,
   Then blame heredity.

   Idle Options
                                                                                                       

   Some advocate active retirement,
   "Schedule each day -- employ it]"
   There are also sensible souls who say,
   "Why not relax and enjoy it?"
   -- George O. Ludcke.
