Marketing  Media:
   Disney's `Fantasia' Posts
   Record Home Video Sales
Disney originally shipped 9.5 million "Fantasia" videos
and disks to retailers, then received orders for nearly five
million more. "What's significant is that all the other big
titles have had returns," with companies shipping more
videocassettes than retailers could sell, said Tom Adams, a
video analyst with Paul Kagan Associates media research firm
in Carmel, Calif. "But instead of returns, Disney got
reorders."
   Bill Mechanic, president of Disney international
theatrical and world-wide video operations, said, "While we
don't know we won't get returns, there was a management of
the process so we knew we would be judicious in everything we
did." Mr. Adams estimates the revenue to Disney from
"Fantasia" cassette sales at more than $200 million.
