Business Brief -- Quadra Logic Technologies Inc.:
   Company Will Adopt Plan
   To Shield It From Takeover
Terms of the plan are similar to those adopted by other
Canadian corporations in recent years. The plan must be
ratified by the company's shareholders at the annual meeting
scheduled for April 28.
   William Foran, president and chief executive officer of
Quadra Logic, said he isn't aware of any pending or
threatened takeover.
   Shareholders will receive one share purchase right for
each share held on March 17, and will be able to exercise
those rights to buy Quadra Logic shares at 50% of the
prevailing market price if any person or group launches a
takeover bid that isn't a permitted bid, or acquires more
than 20% of the company's stock.
   A permitted bid, under terms of the plan, is one extended
to all shareholders by an investor holding no more than 5% of
the company's stock and which is open for at least 75 days.
