Pittston Posts Loss
   Totaling $67.8 Million
   For Fourth Quarter
A $76 million after-tax charge in the quarter was for
future costs associated with certain idle or closed coal
facilities. Pittston also took a $1.5 million charge for
future health benefits of current employees, a new accounting
that companies must adopt by the end of this year. Also
contributing to the loss was a $1.8 million charge for the
adoption of a new accounting standard for income taxes.
   Excluding the special and accounting charges, the company
would have posted a profit of $11.5 million, or 31 cents a
share.
   For the year, Pittston had a loss of $151.9 million, or
$4.07 a share, compared with a profit of $61.1 million, or
$1.64 a share, in the prior year. Without the charges,
earnings would have been $57.1 million, or $1.53 a share.
Revenue, meanwhile, grew 4.3% to $1.93 billion from $1.85
billion.
   In addition to the charge for coal operations, the 1991
results included a charge of $133.1 million for accrued
retiree benefits and a $10.1 million tax credit. The loss
also reflects an accounting charge of $10 million for current
retirement benefits and income tax obligations.
   Pittston stock was quoted at $17.75 a share, down 12.5
cents, in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
