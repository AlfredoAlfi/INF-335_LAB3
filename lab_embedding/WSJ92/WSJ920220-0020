Business Brief -- Marquest Medical Products Inc.:
   Firm Had Loss for Quarter
   After Being Idled by FDA
Marquest had a net loss of $785,000, or 18 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period, after a $115,000 gain from early
retirement of debt.
   Because it couldn't manufacture or ship many of its
products during the quarter, revenue plunged 93% to $858,000
from $12.2 million, the company said.
