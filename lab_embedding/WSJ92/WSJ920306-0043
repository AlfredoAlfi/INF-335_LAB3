Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 52.2% involved
stock-index arbitrage, up from 28.2% the previous week. In
this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index
options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 47.7% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 38.4% inolved
trading for customers. The remaining 13.9% was executed by
firms using principal positions to facilitate customer
trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all of
their program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers: Kidder Peabody and Nomura Securities.
