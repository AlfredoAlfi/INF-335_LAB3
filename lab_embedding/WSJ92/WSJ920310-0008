Business Brief -- Newhall Land  Farming Co.:
   Ranch Parcel Sale Comprises
   Almost All Quarterly Net
Thomas L. Lee, chairman and chief executive, said the sale
is likely to account for nearly all the net income in the
quarter, as the recession has slowed Newhall's sale of
industrial and residential building sites. For the 1991 first
quarter, Newhall reported net income of $7.9 million, or 21
cents per unit.
   The sale is part of Newhall's strategy of selling off
agricultural ranches that have little or no development
potential, Mr. Lee said.
