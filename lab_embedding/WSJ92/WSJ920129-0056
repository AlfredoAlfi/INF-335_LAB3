Business Brief -- General Development Corp.:
   Adverse Ruling on Funds
   May Delay Reorganization
The company wouldn't estimate how much it had hoped to
reap in compensation, but said proceeds from the system
represent a "principal source of expected cash flow," in the
first two years of the company's plan of reorganization.
   General Development said it appealed the court's ruling.
However, it said if it isn't reversed, the effect of the
order might delay the effective date of its reorganization
plan, which is currently set for March 31.
