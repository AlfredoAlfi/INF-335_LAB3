Business Brief -- Affiliated Publications Inc.:
   Early Retirement Plan Set
   By Company's Boston Globe
About 275 full-time employees may be eligible for the
latest program, the Globe said, but only 57, including 30 in
the editorial department and 27 in the business office, will
be granted buy-outs.
   Under terms of the program, employees may retire if they
are at least 52 years old and have 20 years of service or are
62 with 15 years of service. Employees with 10 years of
service or more may choose to receive a lump sum in cash, the
Globe said.
