   In Plan to Produce Taxol
Taxol, currently in short supply, now is extracted from
the bark of the rare Pacific yew tree. However, this
production method requires killing the tree, and has fueled
controversy over its depletion of old-growth forests that are
home to the Northern spotted owl.
   University of Mississippi botanist Edward Croom and his
co-workers have been surveying many species of ornamental yew
shrubs that now are cultivated in nurseries around the
country. Needles trimmed from such shrubs would yield tons of
renewable biomass that would spare the wild-tree bark.
   The pilot program launched at the University of
Mississippi will initially yield only a small fraction of
drug needed to treat all the cancer patients who might
benefit. But the company's agreement to furnish funding for a
pilot plant should enable scaled-up manufacturing capability
for the future, the university said.
