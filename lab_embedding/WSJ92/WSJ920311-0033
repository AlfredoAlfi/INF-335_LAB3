Daiwa Securities Again
   Is Involved in Arbitration
The case is one of several Daiwa is expected to resolve by
this weekend, according to the spokesman. "There are five or
six more," he said.
   If the reported amount must be paid by Daiwa, analysts
said damage to the company would be limited. In a midterm
earnings report issued in September, Daiwa said it had one
trillion yen in cash and deposits, with current assets
totaling 3.7 trillion yen.
   This would hurt Daiwa's earnings and its reputation, but
the payment wouldn't drive the company under, said Alicia
Ogawa, senior analyst at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.
   Two weeks ago, Daiwa agreed to pay Tokyu Land Corp. almost
3.6 billion yen related to tobashi losses. Tokyu Land is in
the same group of companies as Tokyu Department Store.
   The trading practice, which involves securities repurchase
agreements at inflated prices, is not illegal but has stirred
controversy in Tokyo.
