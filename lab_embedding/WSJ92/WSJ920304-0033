Toronto Exchange Trading
   Halted by Computer Woes
Brokers shifted some of their trades to other exchanges.
Volume on the Montreal Exchange was 12.7 million shares, more
than double the daily average.
   "I don't think any brokers suffered, I think most went to
the Montreal Exchange to trade for their clients," said
Murray Gregga, a senior vice president at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.
   Toronto exchange officials halted equities-floor trading
30 minutes into the session, when traders complained of
garbled and incomplete orders appearing on the floor's
computer screens. The halt affected about 800 stocks traded
on the floor of the exchange. It didn't affect trading of 800
stocks on the exchange's Computer Assisted Trading System or
floor trading of futures and options.
   John Thornton, vice president of markets and market
development for the Toronto exchange, said the trouble was
traced to changes made to computer software over the weekend
as part of a move to eliminate equities-floor trading by
early next year. He said that trading resumed after the
changes were removed from the software.
   "We'll probably sort out the trades by the end of
(Wednesday) but finding out what the problem is with the
program will take a couple of weeks, " said Mr. Thornton.
