Van Dorn Stock Price
   Jumps After New Bid
   By Crown Cork  Seal
In a statement, Van Dorn said Crown Cork first made an
unsolicited bid to buy the company on Dec. 20, but was told
on Monday that neither the company nor any of its divisions
were for sale. It also confirmed a second bid by Crown Cork
yesterday, and said it would consider the bid in due course.
   In its most recent offer, Crown Cork, a major container
maker based in Philadelphia, proposed an acquisition for $150
million, or $18 a share. As part of the acquisition, Crown
Cork said it would sell Van Dorn's plastic molding machinery
business to Mannesmann AG of Germany under an agreement
already in place. Van Dorn also operates a container business
producing cans for such products as processed foods and
paint.
