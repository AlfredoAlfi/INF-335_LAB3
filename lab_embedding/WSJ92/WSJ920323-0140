Regan Asks SEC to Permit
   Critiques in Proxy Material
Only shareholders who have owned at least one-half of 1%
of a company's shares for five years or more would be
eligible to submit a statement.
   Mr. Regan told a corporate governance conference that the
plan would let big shareholders air their concerns in a
public forum. He said his approach is preferable to proposals
that would allow institutions to discuss concerns about
corporate performance in private.
   The proposal would give a company's board the right to
include a response to shareholders' statements in the proxy.
   Mr. Regan suggested that the SEC implement the proposal
for two years and then seek public comment. In particular, he
said, regulators and institutions should look at whether
improving access to proxy statements promotes long-term
investment.
