Business Brief -- Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc.:
   Concern Posts Sharp Rise
   In 4th-Quarter Net Income
"The bank is doing a much better job on credit quality,"
said Frank Anderson, an analyst for Stephens Inc., based in
Little Rock, Ark. "They are whittling away at nonperforming
assets." Nonperforming loans fell 17% to $101 million during
1991, the bank said.
   Recurring losses on real estate loans, a legacy of the
past Texas boom, battered Cullen/Frost in 1990, raising
doubts about its turnaround.
   For the full year, the bank reported net income of
$205,000, or two cents a share. Those results include a
charge of $5.4 million related to settlement of litigation.
For all of 1990, the company had a loss of $8.2 million, or
94 cents a share, in 1990.
