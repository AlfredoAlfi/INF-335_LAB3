   Genital Wart Virus May Be
   Cause of Kaposi's Sarcoma
Doctors found the cancer is 10 times more common in men
with AIDS than in those without AIDS, suggesting some other
infectious agent may be responsible for the disease.
   A team of U.S. doctors reported in two articles in the
Lancet medical journal that they found cell fragments of the
human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes genital warts, in
the Kaposi's tumor tissue taken from patients both with and
without AIDS.
   The finding suggests the HPV virus may be the cause of
Kaposi's sarcoma, presenting doctors with a new direction for
trying to treat or prevent the cancer, the researchers said.
