   Russia in Time Change
Russia moved clocks forward an hour yesterday, bringing
them eight hours ahead of Eastern standard time. Only last
year Russia moved them back an hour to correct what Soviet
authorities said had been a time zone error introduced under
Stalin.
   The latest change aroused bitter complaints in Russia over
the early onset of dark winter evenings and higher energy
costs.
