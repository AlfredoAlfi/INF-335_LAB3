International:
   Miyazawa, Japan's Cabinet
   Meet to Discuss Economy
"The possibility that something epoch in nature would come
out {of the meeting} is very small, given the government's
fiscal situation," said Kazutaka Kirishima, senior economist
at Sumitomo Life Research Institute. Even accelerated
public-works spending, part of the stimulative package, can't
be done all at once, he said.
   Some observers suggested the meeting was held to pressure
the central bank to cut rates. Indeed, most major Japanese
newspapers reported Thursday that the Bank of Japan would cut
the discount rate -- which the central bank charges on loans
to other banks -- by 0.5 or 0.75 percentage point from the
current 4.5% next week.
   The Nikkei Stock Average, which tumbled below 20000 Monday
for the first time in more than five years, continued its
downward spiral Wednesday, falling 153.32 points to 19764.31.
The market's decline has raised worries that Japanese
companies, already hurt by the slumping economy, will have
difficulty raising capital.
