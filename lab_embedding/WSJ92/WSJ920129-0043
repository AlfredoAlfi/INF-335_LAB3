Furon to Restructure
   And Post a Big Charge
   For Fiscal 4th Quarter
J. Michael Hagan, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the six targeted companies have annual sales of about
$42 million, or about 14% of Furon's total volume. Furon
makes components of specialized polymer materials for the
industrial market, and serves several industries including
petrochemical, aerospace, medical transportation and
pollution control.
   The earmarked companies are FO-MAC of Tulsa, Okla.; IER of
Twinsburg, Ohio; Grover Piston Ring of Milwaukee; Structural
Bearings of Athens, Texas; Filtration Products of Houston;
and Reynolds and Taylor of Santa Ana, Calif. Mr. Hagan said
he hopes to have those divestitures completed by the end of
1992.
   The restructuring will leave Furon with businesses that
have proprietary materials or processing technologies that
will likely produce better long-term returns, Mr. Hagan said.
