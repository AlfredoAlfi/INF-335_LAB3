Heritage Media Sets
   New-Share Offering
   To Refinance Note
Heritage said the moves will reduce its interest expense
by about $6 million a year.
   The company, which owns television stations and in-store
advertising companies, said it plans to offer the 4.5 million
new shares at the same time as holders of its eight million
Class B shares swap their shares for four million Class A
shares and after a one-for-four reverse stock split of its
Class A shares. The 4.5 million new shares are Class A
shares.
   Both transactions are subject to stockholder approval at a
special meeting. However, because the Class B shares, owned
by James Hoak, chairman, and James Cownie, a director, carry
10 votes each, the company said it already has enough votes
to win approval.
   After the transactions, Heritage will have about 15
million common shares outstanding, and Tele-Communications
will own about an 8.6% stake in the company. The company,
which had $345 million in debt at year end, also said it
hopes to reduce its debt further in 1992.
   The company said it registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer the stock and Goldman, Sachs 
Co. will lead the underwriting group.
   In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, Heritage shares closed at $3.375, down 12.5 cents.
