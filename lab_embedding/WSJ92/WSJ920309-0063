SEC Plans to Open Offices
   To Assist Eastern Europe
Mr. Breeden said the program is "very much in the interest
of the U.S." He said the U.S. has "the best mousetrap" when
it comes to securities markets, and that helping other
nations set up similar markets will contribute to a stronger
world economy.
   The SEC expects to have its personnel placed in Eastern
Europe this fall.
