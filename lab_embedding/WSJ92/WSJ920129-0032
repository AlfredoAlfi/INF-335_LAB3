Technology Brief -- Storage Technology Corp.:
   Unveils New Device
   For Storing Mainframe Data
The vast amounts of data required by mainframes are stored
on expensive, specialized devices. Storage Technology,
Louisville, Colo., is hoping its new system will undermine
the popularity of existing disk drives in much the way that
networks of personal computers have been cobbled together to
handle jobs that once were the sole province of mainframes.
   Storage Technology said it has orders thus far from more
than 140 customers. The company, which will begin volume
shipments in the second half of this year, said it expects to
build 1,000 to 1,200 systems next year. The systems range in
price from $1.3 million to $3.6 million.
