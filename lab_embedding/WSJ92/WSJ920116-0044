International Brief -- Porsche AG:
   Net Fell 70% in Fiscal '91;
   Continuing Slump Is Seen
Porsche also cut its dividend on preferred shares to 10
marks a share from 13 marks a year earlier. The dividend on
voting shares of the family-owned company was slashed to nine
marks from 12 marks in fiscal 1990.
   Porsche's results were much worse than analysts expected
and again raised questions as to whether the relatively small
company can remain independent.
   "Our main goal isn't profit growth," Mr. Bohn said, but
rather "to keep the company healthy and independent." Mr.
Bohn didn't give a specific profit forecast for either the
current or future years.

   PORSCHE AG's chairman, Arno Bohn, said the German car
maker's main goal isn't "volume growth," but rather to keep
the company healthy and remain independent. Because of a
translation error, he was incorrectly quoted in yesterday's
edition.
