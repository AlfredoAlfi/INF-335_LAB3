Canada's Inflation Index
   Rose 0.2% in February
Bank of Canada Gov. John Crow told reporters that the
country is "on track" to meet the inflation reduction targets
set a year ago by the central bank and the federal Finance
Department.
   The inflation reduction targets call for a gradual slowing
in the rise in the consumer price index over the next four
years. The ultimate goal is zero inflation, or price
stability. "We remain committed to meeting" the targets, Mr.
Crow said. The country's inflation rate is currently one of
the lowest among industrial countries.
   Before adjustment for seasonal factors, the consumer price
index in February was up 0.1% from January and up 1.7% from a
year earlier. In January the index was up 1.6% from a year
earlier, the smallest such rise in 21 years.
