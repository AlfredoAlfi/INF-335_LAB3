Goldman Sachs to Pay
   $8.7 Million to Settle
   West Virginia Case
A Goldman Sachs spokesman did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
   West Virginia has now received $28 million in out-of-court
settlements from seven of the nine securities firms,
including $15 million last year from Salomon Brothers.
   Rudolph DiTrapano, a Charleston lawyer representing West
Virginia, said the remaining litigation against Morgan
Stanley  Co. and Chase Securities Inc., a unit of Chase
Manhattan Corp., is scheduled for trial in Charleston on
March 23.
   In 1986, the state investment pool was the envy of the
country, with a return of 13.8%, almost double what other
states were generating. But the investments resulted in
high-volume trading and dealing in options, which the state
claims are illegal methods for investing public monies
because they're too risky. The nine firms were responsible
for $100 million of the $231 million loss, state officials
said.
