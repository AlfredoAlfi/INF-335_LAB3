Sunshine Mining Co.
   Told to Pay Damages
   To Former Partner
Sunshine Mining executives said they will seek a new
trial, and if that fails, they will appeal the verdict. An
attorney for the Boulles said if Sunshine appeals the judge's
ruling, the brothers will appeal the decision on punitive
damages. "The conduct of Sunshine Mining Co. through their
officers reflects their attitude toward the business world,
and they have to answer for it," said Mark Nacol, attorney
for the Boulles.
   Sunshine said that it doesn't believe the judgment will
hold up on appeal, so that it will have no material impact on
the company's liquidity or operations. But if the judgment
isn't reversed, it will weigh heavily on Sunshine, which is
struggling because silver prices have fallen below the cost
of producing silver. The company is considering filing a
prepackaged bankruptcy petition for its Sunshine Precious
Metals Inc. unit, if 95% of its holders of Sunshine Precious
Metals silver-indexed bonds don't accept an exchange offer.
The company said 74% of the bonds have been voted in favor of
the prepackaged bankruptcy.
