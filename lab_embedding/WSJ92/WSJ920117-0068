Marketing  Media -- Walt Disney Co.:
   Pact Set for the Purchase
   Of 50% of TV, Film Studio
The agreement doesn't include any television rights or
other "software," a Disney spokesman said. The entertainment
giant is interested in the property because it needs more
sound stages, he said. The CBS/MTM studios, which cover 39
acres, include 20 sound stages.
   Completion of the sale also hinges upon TVS's MTM
Entertainment Inc. unit continuing to use the facility to
make certain television programs. TVS said it hopes to
complete the sale "in the next 135 days."
