Federal Judge Dismisses
   Civil Claim Against BCCI
The complaint includes an unusual number of named
defendants -- 56 -- ranging from Price Waterhouse, BCCI's
auditors, to WPP Group's Hill  Knowlton, which once provided
public relations advice to the bank. BCCI Holdings
(Luxembourg) S.A., the bank's holding company, as well as
several affiliates, directors and customers were also named.
   Judge Marshall demanded, for instance, that the complaint
distinguish between the separate partnerships that comprise
the Price Waterhouse organization; that it "identify the
time, place and contents" of each of many misrepresentations
alleged in the suit, and that it detail "who received income
derived from the pattern of racketeering activity" that is
alleged in the suit.
   Perhaps most significantly, the judge appeared to question
whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue at a time when
BCCI's carcass is still being carved up for the benefit of
creditors.
   The Milberg Weiss partner handling the case wasn't
available for comment. The judge gave the plaintiffs 20 days
to file a beefed-up complaint.
