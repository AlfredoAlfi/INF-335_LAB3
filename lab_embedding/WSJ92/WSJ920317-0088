Homestake Is Offering
   International Corona
   $130 Million of Credit
The company also faces longer-term financing pressures
that could strain its already debt-heavy balance sheet. These
include the cost of developing its rich Eskay Creek gold
discovery in British Columbia, which is expected to begin
production in 1994.
   However, Corona's prospects appeared brighter by the end
of last week when it announced its agreement to be acquired
by Homestake, a San Francisco gold-mining company. Corona
expects Homestake will more easily be able to pay for
developing Eskay Creek.
   Corona said the new line of credit also will enable it to
draw up to US$62 million in additional funds under an
existing credit facility. It said the Homestake offer of
credit will continue until the end of this year and isn't
dependent on the acquisition.
