Letters to the Editor:
   Big Board's Problem
   With Foreign Listings
Rather than reconcile their accounts, foreign companies
shun the U.S. public markets, and U.S. investors are denied
investment opportunities. Unless the Securities and Exchange
Commission permits the NYSE to list the securities of foreign
companies without reconciliation, U.S. investors will
continue to lose out.
