Technology Brief -- Dell Computer Corp.:
   Computer Maker Will Sell
   New Line in Price Clubs
Dell said the move is part of its strategy to sell through
select mass-market outlets to reach small businesses and
people with home offices who want low-price computers. The
company also sells Dell computers through CompUSA Inc., a
chain of computer superstores, and Staples Inc., a chain of
office superstores.
   Price Clubs, owned by Price Co., San Diego, are gigantic
warehouse-like outlets aimed at small businesses that sell
relatively few items at very low prices.
