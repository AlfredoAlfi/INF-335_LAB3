Pepper...and Salt
We're colorizing old movies
   And remixing old records these days,
   As formerly precious old relics
   Now change in mysterious ways.
   This trend has grave implications,
   For unless it quickly ceases,
   We'll soon see museums promoting
   Their "new and improved" masterpieces.

   False Starts
                                                                                                       

   From davenport to our front door,
   If measured in delays,
   Are three "We must be goings"
   And four "Oh, by the ways."
   -- Frank Walsh.
