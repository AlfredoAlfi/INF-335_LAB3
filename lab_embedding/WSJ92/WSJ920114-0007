Business Brief -- Action Staffing Inc.:
   Loss of $12 Million Posted
   For Year; President Resigns
The company's president, Lawrence E. Jones, 50 years old,
couldn't be reached for comment. The company declined to
comment about a possible successor.
   Action Staffing said revenue climbed 22% for fiscal 1991
to $211.1 million. The loss for the year, however, was due
largely to workers compensation costs and group
health-insurance claims in excess of company projections. In
fiscal 1990, the company reported net income of $752,621.
   The company's commercial financing unit, Kent Holdings
Ltd., also reported a loss for the year of $2.3 million,
stemming from its investment in Great Oaks Financial Corp., a
Boca Raton, Fla., insurer that was seized by the state in
December.
