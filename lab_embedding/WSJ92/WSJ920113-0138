   Ratners, in Shake-Up,
   Picks New Chairman,
   Suspends Its Dividend
The expected boardroom shake-up followed a lackluster
Christmas season at Ratners, which operates 1,000 stores in
Britain and about 1,000 stores in the U.S. But it wasn't
helped when Mr. Ratner made a speech that disparaged one of
the products sold by the chain, a sherry decanter, as "total
crap." In Britain, Ratners is a mass-market jeweler
specializing in relatively inexpensive items.
   Ratners expects "break-even" operating profit for the year
ending Feb. 1, down from a profit of #134.2 million a year
earlier. Last year, Ratners had net income of #69 million on
sales of #1.1 billion.
