Law:
   EPA to Review
   National Standard
   For Ozone Smog

If the standards change, states will have to implement the
revised allowable ozone levels in the air pollution plans
they are required to formulate under the Clean Air Act.
   The agreement, which was signed by U.S. District Judge
John R. Bartels of New York City, comes in a case brought by
the American Lung Association and other environmental and
health groups, as well as five state attorneys general. The
environmental groups sued the EPA last year demanding a
review of the ozone standards which have not changed since
1979. The environmental groups believe the standards are
outdated and need to be tougher.
   "We're confident that the evidence does indicate the need
to revise the standards," said Ron White, environmental
health director of the American Lung Association.
   Martin Baker, an attorney at the New York law firm Stroock
 Stroock  Lavan, which represented the environmental
groups, said, "the EPA has been stonewalling."
   Henry V. Nickel, an attorney for a consortium of 60
electrical utilities, said his clients oppose Judge Bartels's
order because it doesn't allow the utilities the right to ask
for additional time to comment on any proposed change in
standards. Judge Bartels denied a request by the utilities to
intervene in the case and they are appealing that ruling.
   "There's a lot of new information on ozone out there,"
said Mr. Nickel of the Washington office of Hunton 
Williams. He said that not all of the data has been
thoroughly reviewed and that the utilities may need more time
to develop a position on ozone standards.
   Attorneys for the EPA could not be reached for comment.
