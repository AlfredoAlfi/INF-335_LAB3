Business Brief -- Japan Airlines:
   Carrier Unveils 4-Year Plan
   For Its Domestic Expansion
The airline said the plan will allow JAL to handle an
expected increase in competition by the mid-1990s as the
expansion of Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports and the
opening of the New Kansai International Airport come on line.
   JAL aims to raise operating revenue to 1.6 trillion yen
($12.53 billion) by 1996, with an average increase of 6% a
year. In the fiscal year ended March 1991, operating revenue
came to 1.119 trillion yen.
   For the period between April 1992 and March 1996, the
company expects domestic passenger traffic to grow 9% a year,
international traffic to rise 6% a year and cargo-mail
business to rise 4% a year.
   JAL said it expects the airline market to recover from its
current stagnant stage by late 1992 or early 1993.
