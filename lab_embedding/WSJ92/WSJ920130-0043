GM to Post Charge
   Of Under $3 Billion
   For the 4th Period
The fourth-quarter charge will further depress what is
expected to be a financially dismal quarter for the auto
maker. Analysts had expected the company to post a loss of
between $532 million and $750 million for the quarter, before
any charge.
   GM disclosed more details about the charge in its SEC
filing related to a proposed sale of preference Class C stock
that could be converted into shares of its Class E Electronic
Data Systems Corp. shares.
   In December, GM said it plans to close 21 additional
factories, cut 74,000 jobs and slash capital spending over
the next four years. GM still hasn't said what plants will be
closed when.
   By taking the charge in the fourth quarter, GM can begin
1992 with a clean slate. Company executives have said they
want to be able to at least break even this year, after two
straight years of losses.
   In the 1990 fourth quarter, GM had a loss of $1.6 billion,
or $2.89 a share, on revenue of $29.9 billion.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, GM fell
$1.625 a share, to $32.75.
