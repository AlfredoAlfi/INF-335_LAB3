Pall Corp. to Report
   Increase in Earnings
   For Fiscal 2nd Period
The 1991 results are restated to reflect the company's
3-for-2 stock split paid Dec. 27 to shareholders of record
Dec. 4.
   In the year-ago second quarter, before restatement for the
split, Pall reported net of $16.7 million, or 29 cents a
share, on revenue of $163.7 million.
   For fiscal 1991, before restatement, Pall posted earnings
of $79.9 million, or $1.38 a share, on revenue of $657
million.
   Mr. Hardy said the target of $715 million in sales for
fiscal 1992 "looks okay." For the second quarter, he expects
percentage revenue growth in the "low teens." However, this
growth rate will come excluding $12.6 million in year-ago
revenue made during operation Desert Storm and a 2.5%
reduction in sales caused by exchange rates.
   Mr. Hardy also said the company's health-care segment
"continues to exceed our expectations," but fluid-processing
is a "little down" compared with last year because of
recessionary pressures.
