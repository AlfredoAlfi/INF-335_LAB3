Continental Air to Sell Assets
Continental said the LaGuardia assets duplicated its
Newark, N.J., airport operations. In addition, the sale to
USAir frees Continental from about $200 million of financing
obligations for the new LaGuardia terminal.
   Continental said December traffic rose 11.2% to 3.6
billion revenue passenger miles from 3.23 billion a year
before. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger
flown one mile. Load factor, or percentage of seats filled,
rose to 64.9% from 59.1%. For 1991, revenue passenger miles
increased 5.8% to 41.44 billion from 39.18 billion in 1990.
The 1991 load factor rose to 62.6% from 60.4%.
