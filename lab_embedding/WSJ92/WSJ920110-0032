   US Sprint Expands Service
   To Former Soviet Union
However, Sprint calls beginning today will travel directly
to each republic while ATT calls, with the exception of
those to Armenia, must be routed through Moscow and use
operator assistance to reach their destination.
   Sprint is getting some help. The unit of United
Telecommunications Inc., Westwood, Kan., will send its calls
from the U.S. to a switching facility in St. Petersburg.
There the calls will be forwarded to other automatic
switching centers in the republics via facilities run by
IDBT of Rockville, Md., a unit of IDB Communications Group,
Inc., a Los Angeles satellite services company.
   "ATT is probably working on a similar agreement with the
former {Soviet} republics," a Sprint spokesman said. "But we
have an application to expand by an additional 43 circuits
over the Intelsat {International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization} network, and being first gives us a window of
opportunity" to lure new customers.
   While an ATT spokesman said the company is "always
looking to improve service," he wouldn't comment on the
company's strategy for reaching republics other than Russia
and Armenia.
   MCI Communications Corp. is seeking similar expansion, a
spokesman said.
