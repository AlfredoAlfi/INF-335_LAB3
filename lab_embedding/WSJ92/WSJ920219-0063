Business Brief -- Tandy Corp.:
   New, Low-Priced Computer
   Features Latest Technology
The spokesman said Tandy will continue to offer new
technologies, such as multimedia computers and pen-based
machines, while pursuing a parallel strategy of producing
more inexpensive, plain-vanilla boxes. The shift reflects
intense price and product competition in the personal
computer market and follows similar efforts by makers like
Compaq Computer Corp. to reduce prices and make functional,
run-of-the-mill computers rather than state-of-the-art
machines.
   A Tandy spokesman said its new 4825 SX computer, which
includes a 120 megabyte hard drive but no monitor, will sell
for $1,999 at Radio Shack stores.
