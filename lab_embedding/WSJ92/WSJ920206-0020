Business Brief -- Dresser Industries Inc.:
   Company Plans to Spin Off
   Two Struggling Operations
The businesses to be transferred include refractory
operations, mining equipment, draglines and power shovels,
industrial tools, air compressor operations in France, a 50%
interest in a construction equipment operation in South
Africa, and a 50% interest in the Komatsu-Dresser
construction equipment joint venture.
   Excluding the joint ventures, these businesses had revenue

to a subsidiary, which will then be spun off to shareholders
in a transaction expected to be tax free.
