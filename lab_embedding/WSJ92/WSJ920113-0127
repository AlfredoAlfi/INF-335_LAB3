   Travelers Corp. Says
   Mulvihill Appointed
   To Health Policy Post
"The direct involvement of medical professionals within
insurance companies is beginning to occur more often," Dr.
Mulvihill said. "It is helpful to have inside health
professionals wrestling with the issues" of quality health
care and cost control.
   He said Travelers's standards for medical management and
quality measurement serve as models in the industry and that
"not only in insurance, but in workers' compensation areas,
disability, and occupational and preventive medicines, there
is an increasing number of medical professionals getting
involved." He added, "insurance companies are recognizing
that these individuals have something to contribute as they
try to do the best for their customers."
   Dr. Mulvihill received his doctorate from the Harvard
School of Dental Medicine. At Travelers he will work with a
team of physicians, other health care professionals and
insurance executives to develop new managed health care
programs, in addition to recruiting additional medical staff
for the insurance company.
