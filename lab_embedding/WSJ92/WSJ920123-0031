Enterprise:
   Franchise-Buying Receives
   Good Marks in Owner Poll
Some 23% earned between $50,000 and $100,000, 26% earned
between $100,000 and $300,000, and 11% earned $300,000 or
more. (Some 14% of the owners didn't disclose their income.)
On average, the owners had invested $147,570 to obtain their
franchises, Gallup found.
   Franchisee satisfaction is generally high, according to
the poll, which was released here by its sponsor, the
International Franchise Association, a franchiser trade
group. While 47% of respondents characterized their
businesses as "very successful," only 2% described them as
"very unsuccessful." Only 6% of respondents described their
working relationships with the franchiser as "poor," Gallup
said. Profit has met or exceeded expectations for 56% of the
respondents, Gallup found. But the amount of work required
has exceeded the expectations of 82%.
   On the other hand, three-fourths of respondents said that,
with hindsight, they would invest in the same franchise
business again, and franchisees appeared happier than U.S.
workers in general, Gallup said: Only 39% of workers in a
separate poll said they would repeat their job experience.
