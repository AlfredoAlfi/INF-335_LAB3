Associate of HUD Ex-Chief
   Pleads Guilty in Tax Case
According to a plea agreement released yesterday, Mr.
Singletary admitted to law enforcement officials that in 1985
he failed to report income from the Center for Resource
Development. He faces a maximum penalty of five years'
imprisonment for the felony count.
   Under the agreement, Mr. Singletary will "provide full
cooperation" to the investigation by independent counsel
Arlin Adams, according to a statement released by Mr. Adams's
office.
   In testimony before the House employment and housing
subcommittee, former HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary DuBois
Gilliam said that Mr. Pierce had directed him to "help Sam
Singletary get some funds." Mr. Gilliam was convicted of
accepting gratuities and conspiring to defraud the government
in connection with the HUD scandal.
   Mr. Singletary's guilty plea fueled speculation that Mr.
Pierce may be indicted. But Paul Perito, Mr. Pierce's lawyer,
denied that Mr. Pierce did anything illegal or "untoward" to
assist the grant.
