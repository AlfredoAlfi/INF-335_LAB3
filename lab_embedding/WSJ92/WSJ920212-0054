Ex-Marathon Holders
   Are Offered $3 Million
   By Donaldson Lufkin
Last December, a U.S. magistrate judge recommended that
USX and DLJ pay 12,000 Marathon shareholders a total of $409
million because of the late acceptance of shares in the
tender offer. Most of the payment was to be made by USX; the
DLJ settlement is about $250,000 less than its portion of the
damages as calculated by the magistrate. The magistrate's
finding also included about $194 million in interest, but the
DLJ settlement does not include any proportional interest
costs.
   A spokeswoman for DLJ, which is a unit of Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the U.S., said the firm had no comment.
   USX has asked U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in New York
to review the magistrate's finding. She will also hold a
hearing next month on the proposed settlement with DLJ.
