Business Brief -- Wachovia Corp.:
   Interest Rate Is Lowered
   On Credit Cards to 9.4%
With one of the lowest rate cards available, Wachovia is
gambling it can take market share away from other big issuers
without hurting its profit margins. Some banks have argued
that lowering rates would draw riskier customers who may have
a higher chance of defaulting on their card payments.
   Industry experts, however, caution that lower-rate cards
are more difficult to obtain because the issuing bank is more
selective than issuers of higher rate cards.
