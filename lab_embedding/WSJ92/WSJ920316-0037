Business Brief -- Titan Corp.:
   Air Force May Terminate
   Linkabit's Satellite Contract
The company said the satellite terminal contract had
experienced unspecified cost overruns. If the contract is
terminated, any impact on Titan's financial results could be
partially mitigated by reserves already taken for completion
of the contract.
   Titan said it intends to defend itself vigorously, but
added that the ultimate impact on its financial condition
cannot be determined. Company executives could not be reached
over the weekend to comment. Titan stock closed at $4 Friday,
down 12.5 cents in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
