   Firm Announces Results
   Of Its Fraud Investigation
The company also said that its investigation had
determined that a previous official of the unit, who resigned
in June 1991, "was responsible for these accounting
overstatements and misstatements." The company said it had
filed a lawsuit against the former employee, whose name a
company spokesman declined to disclose, alleging, among other
things, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud.
   The company's delayed 1991 annual meeting of shareholders
has now been scheduled for April 7, MMI Medical said.
