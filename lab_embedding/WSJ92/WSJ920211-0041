Business Brief -- B.A.T Industries PLC:
   Brown  Williamson to Use
   More Warning Labels Abroad
A spokesman for Brown  Williamson, Louisville, Ky., said
more than 90% of its cigarettes sold overseas already carry
some type of health warning, so its plan would only pertain
to the balance. He said 40% of unit volume is in
international products, representing about a 20% market share
in overseas cigarette sales among U.S. companies.
   The company, a unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries PLC,
said it would begin putting the notices on packs later this
year.
