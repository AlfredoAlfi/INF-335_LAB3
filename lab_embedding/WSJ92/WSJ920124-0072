Technology:
   Liposome Has Pact
   To Work on Vaccine
   With Wyeth-Ayerst
The companies are starting a development program which
will lead to product registration and marketing.
Wyeth-Ayerst, a research-oriented pharmaceutical company
based in Philadelphia, will conduct the development effort.
   In experiments by both companies, animals injected with an
influenza vaccine containing the liposomal adjuvant had much
greater immune responses than those receiving vaccines
without it, the companies said. They said it is believed that
the level of immune response is a good indicator of how well
the vaccine might work in protecting against flu infections.
   Both company's shares were up strongly on the news.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American
Home shares were quoted at $80.375, up $1.625.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Liposome shares
closed at $23.625, up $1.50.
