Business Brief -- Jefferson-Pilot Corp.:
   Dissident Holder Demands
   That Official Return Profit
Mrs. Parsons said that Mr. Soles received the stock award
under an amendment to an incentive plan approved by company
shareholders May 7, 1990, which she contends was approved
after management "lied" to shareholders in the 1990 proxy
statement. She filed a lawsuit alleging proxy fraud July
1991.
   John Still, Jefferson-Pilot's senior vice president for
corporate development, accused Mrs. Parsons of making
"misleading and fatuous" charges. "She's trying desperately
to create controversy out of thin air in her ongoing attempt
to use the courts and the media to discredit and depose
Jefferson-Pilot's management," he said.
