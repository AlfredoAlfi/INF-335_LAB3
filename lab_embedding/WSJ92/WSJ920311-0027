International Brief -- Tokai Bank Ltd.:
   Profit Forecast Is Lowered
   Due to Increase in Reserves
Tokai didn't revise its earlier estimate that revenue will
total 2.65 trillion yen, and said it doesn't plan to change
its per-share dividend of 4.25 yen for the second half and
8.50 yen for the full year.
   The revisions were "largely the result of approximately 50
billion yen being added to the bank's specific loan-loss
provision to cover potential exposure to loans assumed . . .
in connection with the Akihabara affair," Tokai said,
referring to a collateral scandal last summer.
