Edisto Restructuring
   Entails Exchange Bid,
   Consolidation of Units
As part of the restructuring, Edisto said it will
consolidate its oil and gas units, NRM Energy and Edisto
Exploration  Production Co., into a new subsidiary. A
company spokesman wouldn't comment on the effect that the
consolidation of subsidiaries and the financial restructuring
would have on the number of employees. However, he said the
company plans to reduce general administrative costs this
year "a little bit more" than the $3 million announced last
October.
   In addition to these changes, Edisto intends to amend its
certificate of incorporation to increase the number of
authorized common shares to 75 million from 50 million. The
revamping plan also involves an amendment of its bank credit
agreements and the indenture governing the notes.
   The restructuring will go forward if at least 80% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes are tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration date of the exchange offer;
if the stockholders approve the indenture and charter
amendments; and if the bank lender consents to the changes in
the credit agreement.
   Merrill Lynch  Co. will act as manager of the exchange
offer, as well as financial adviser for the restructuring.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Edisto shares closed unchanged at 68.75 cents.
