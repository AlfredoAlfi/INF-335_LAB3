IRS's Award of a Contract
   To ATT Is Reaffirmed
The contract is one of the largest computer contracts ever
awarded by the U.S. and is the third major government
computer contract won by ATT against IBM in as many years.
   The IRS action also is a big win for tiny Pyramid, of
Mountain View, Calif., which will supply about 3,200
high-performance minicomputers potentially valued at hundreds
of millions of dollars. All told the ATT-Pyramid team will
supply 50,000 work stations along with minicomputers and
communications network equipment to link the gear. "Obviously
we're delighted," said an ATT spokesman.
   In Bethesda, Md., a spokesman for IBM said: "We find it
difficult to imagine how the IRS can justify paying {so much}
more for ATT's solution when all the bidders satisfied the
requirements." He said IBM has the option of filing another
protest, and "we certainly won't rule out that possibility."
