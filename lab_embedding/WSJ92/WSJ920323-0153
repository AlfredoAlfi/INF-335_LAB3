   Only Way to Cure
   Real-Estate Values
2) If Prof. Macey believes real-estate values go down when
interest rates go up, he is probably the only one in the
entire industry who does not recognize that inflation raises
the value of real estate and in inflationary times we have
high rates. He also failed to mention that when the
government seizes and liquidates banks, their average losses
have been 30% of gross assets.
   The only way to cure the real-estate asset value is time
and good management.
