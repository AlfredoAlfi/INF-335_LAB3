   Net Loss of $18.2 Milllion
   Posted for Fiscal 3rd Period
The Fairfax, Va., provider of environmental and other
professional services said the charge reflected operating
losses and sale prices for disposed businesses. The charge
also provides a financial buffer against any other losses or
lower-than-expected sale prices for the remaining three
discontinued businesses -- Edgar Dunn Group, Phase Linear
Systems and Health  Sciences Research.
   "The reserve addition, despite its immediate impact on our
financial results, will help put the restructuring behind us
and allow us to focus" on continuing businesses, said James
O. Edwards, chairman and chief executive officer.
   ICF shares nevertheless dropped on the news, falling 75
cents to $8 in national over-the-counter trading.
