Business Brief -- Price Communications Corp.:
   Concern Reaches Agreement
   On Preset Reorganization
Under the plan, holders of its subordinated debt would get
94.5% of Price's common, current shareholders would keep 3.5%
and management would get 2% on completion of the
reorganization. Current management would remain, with the
president, Robert Price, receiving a three-year employment
contract.
   A group led by Apollo Investment Fund L.P. and James
Finkelstein would purchase 75% of New York Law Journal

million in cash, assumption of $40 million of Price's $45
million in bank debt outstanding and forgiveness of about $24
million of subordinated debt held by the investor group.
