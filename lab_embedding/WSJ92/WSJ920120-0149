Treasury Tax Chief Gideon
   To Leave at Month's End
Mr. Gideon has been at the Treasury since 1989. He helped
craft the tax elements of the 1990 deficit-reduction law as
well as the tax proposals President Bush will unveil later
this month. He and Mr. Graetz recently completed a major
study of ways to integrate corporate and personal income
taxes.
