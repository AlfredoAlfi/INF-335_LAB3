Merrill Lynch to Manage
   Funds for NBA Players
NBA players make an average salary of close to $1 million
a year, triple the salary of a decade ago. But many athletes
have a history of frittering away their money -- or having it
stolen through fraud -- before they hit middle age.
   The players have agreed to set aside part of their
salaries for the pre-pension fund, which is starting out with
$22 million and is to grow to as much as $200 million within
four years. When a player leaves the league, he will get
fixed monthly payments in the form of an annuity. All NBA
players will contribute part of their salaries to the fund, a
step that the players approved last year. Players can also
make voluntary contributions to the fund.
   Although Merrill's gross revenue from the contract over
the four years might be less than $3 million, according to
people familiar with the deal, the firm gets the chance to
build relationships with some of the world's richest athletes
and their families.
