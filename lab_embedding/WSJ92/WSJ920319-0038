Business Brief -- American Maize-Products Co.:
   Corn Refiner Is Sued
   Over List of Shareholders
Eric Steinkraus, also a Maize stockholder, last month
filed a derivative and class action suit, claiming, among
other things, that American Maize turned down a good faith
offer by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. to acquire the company.
Both suits were filed in Portland, Maine. American Maize,
based in Stamford, Conn., is incorporated in Maine.
   American Maize officials couldn't be reached for comment.
The company has denied it received an offer from
ArcherDaniels.
   Philip Steinkraus says he wants the list to communicate
with other shareholders regarding the election of directors,
to be held at the annual meeting April 24.
