Business Brief -- VRG Groep N.V.:
   Profit Jumped 28% in 1991
   Due to Extraordinary Gain
Sales declined slightly to 3.14 billion guilders from 3.17
billion guilders.
   VRG's profit rise came on an extraordinary gain of 28
million guilders from the sale of Scaldia Papier. In 1990,
the company had an extraordinary gain of 1.5 million
guilders.
   Without the extraordinary items, the company's profit fell
12% to 57.1 million guilders from 65 million guilders.
   However, VRG issued an optimistic forecast for 1992,
stating that it expects sales to rise at all three of its
major divisions. The company said profit from ordinary
activities should also rise if the price of paper stabilizes
and the office systems market recovers.
   VRG's 1991 dividend was unchanged from 2.75 guilders in
1990.
