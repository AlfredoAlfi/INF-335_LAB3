Amex, Chicago Merc
   To Sell Products Tied
   To SP 'MidCap 400'
The Amex said it will trade index options on the MidCap
400. The Chicago Merc said it will trade futures and options
on futures on the index. Both plan to launch the MidCap 400
products Feb. 13.
   The two exchanges said the Securities and Exchange
Commission has approved the Amex's options and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission is expected to approve the Merc's
futures and futures options by Feb. 11. The exchanges said
they were granted an exclusive license in September to trade
derivative instruments on the SP MidCap.
   Separately, New York's Commodity Exchange said it filed
applications with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
trade futures, as well as options on futures, based on the
"Eurotop 100" index. The index tracks 100 companies in nine
European countries.
   The Comex said it reached a licensing agreement with the
European Options Exchange in Amsterdam, which trades the
Eurotop 100 index and controls rights to the index. Comex
said members of the New York Futures Exchange will also be
able to trade the Eurotop contracts. It said it expects the
contracts to begin trading by the fourth quarter.
