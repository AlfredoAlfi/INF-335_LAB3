Pepper...and Salt
Old Golf is a paradoxical game,
   As we learn the longer we play;
   By the time we can afford to lose balls,
   We can't hit them that far away.
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Food for Thought
                                                                                                       

   My recipe for eating right
   Is summed up by this thought:
   If foods list things you can't pronounce,
   They're better off not bought.
   -- Harriet Cooper.
