Japan's Export Contracts Fall
It was the seventh consecutive month in which import
contracts declined from year-earlier levels and the third in
a row in which exports contracts fell.
   The council said export contracts fell mainly because of
declines in those made for machinery and metals, while falls
in import deals for chemicals and metals put a significant
drag on the import sector.
   Except for a 0.3% increase in textile export contracts to
34.9 billion yen, contracts in every major export category
fell in January.
