KLM Posts Latest Load Factor
KLM reported that in December 1991 it flew 200.9 million
ton/kilometers of passenger traffic compared with the
year-earlier level of 191.3 million ton/kilometers. A ton
kilometer is a measurement that registers the weight of the
passengers flown over the distance they traveled.
   Freight and mail traffic in December rose to 201.5 million
ton/kilometers, compared with 191.4 million ton/kilometers in
December 1990.
   However, the increase in passenger, freight and mail
traffic wasn't able to absorb the higher product capacity
level. KLM reported that in December 1991 product capacity
totaled 588.8 million ton/kilometers, a 7% advance on the
1990 figure of 550.6 million ton/kilometers.
