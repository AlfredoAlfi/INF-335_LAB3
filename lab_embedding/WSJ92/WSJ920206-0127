   Health-Care Costs Add
   $1,086 to U.S. Car Prices
The Michigan study said that the health-care costs of the
Big Three U.S. auto makers could be as much as $500 more per
vehicle than that of their Japanese competitors. For 1990,
that would mean a $4.8 billion cost penalty for the U.S.
industry.
   The trends point to an even tighter squeeze on Detroit's
earnings. Some 44% of the beneficiaries of the Big Three's
health-insurance contracts are retirees, the study said, and
thus don't contribute to production. In time, more than half
of the beneficiaries will be nonworkers. By contrast,
Japanese-owned auto plants in the U.S. employ younger workers
and thus are "years away" from feeling a comparable squeeze,
the study said.
