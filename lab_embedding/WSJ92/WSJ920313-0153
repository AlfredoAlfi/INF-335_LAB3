Toyota Slates Expansion
Toyota anticipates rapid growth of the Thai auto market
and wants to comply with a request made in late 1991 by the
Thai government for support and cooperation in the
development of the country's automobile industry and the
expansion of exports, the spokeswoman said.
   Construction and production schedules of a new plant are
still under consideration. Models to be produced and capacity
have yet to be decided.
