Remaining Defendants
   Settle MiniScribe Lawsuit
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The defendants declined to specify the amount of the
settlement, as did the bondholders' lawyer, Joseph R. Jamail
of Houston.
   As part of the settlement, state district Judge Roy
Engelke of Galveston set aside the verdict handed up Feb. 4,
the first to be returned in the dozen or more suits filed by
stockholders and bondholders against MiniScribe officers,
directors and advisers. Most of those suits are pending in
federal court in Denver. The disk-drive maker, which was
based in Longmont, Colo., sought bankruptcy-court protection
in January 1990 after an internal company investigation found
that senior management "perpetrated a massive fraud" on the
company, its directors and investors.
