Marketing  Media:
   Spelling to Purchase
   Certain TV Rights
   To Films of Carolco
The companies said the transaction would include certain
assumed obligations and the sale of certain receivables tied
to the films. Carolco would be entitled to additional
compensation, the amount of which wasn't specified, after
Spelling deducts certain fees and recoups its advance and
distribution costs.
   Spelling has an exclusive 30-day period to reach a
definitive agreement with Carolco Television Inc., a
subsidiary of Carolco Pictures; the transaction would then be
subject to approval by directors of both companies.
   Spelling is a television program and movie producer and
distributor. Last week its 82% owner, Charter Co. of
Jacksonville, Fla., proposed buying the Spelling shares it
doesn't already own in a stock swap. Charter is controlled by
American Financial Corp. and its owner, financier Carl H.
Lindner, who is also chairman of Spelling. Carolco, a
cash-strapped movie production company, is in the midst of a
financial restructuring that involves a bailout by a group of
foreign partners.
