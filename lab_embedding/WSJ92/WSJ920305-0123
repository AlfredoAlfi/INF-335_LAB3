SEC to Vote on Plan
   By Amex to Launch
   Market for Start-Ups
The Amex Emerging Company Marketplace represents a direct
challenge to the National Association of Securities Dealers'
Nasdaq system, which traditionally has provided a home for
start-up companies.
   The NASD maintains, however, that small companies are
already well cared for by the Nasdaq system. Robert Ferri, a
spokesman for the NASD, said the NASD provides a way for
start-up companies to break into the securities markets.
Moreover, he said the NASD enables them to move on to bigger
markets once their companies become successful without
leaving the Nasdaq system.
   "Where there is a niche for the Amex to fill is unclear to
say the least," he said.
   The success of the Amex plan may depend on whether issuers
believe an auction market is more attractive than the NASD's
electronic trading system. In a statement, Amex Chairman
James Jones said discussions between exchange officials and
potential issuers "revealed there was pent-up demand from
companies who wanted access to the auction market in their
growth stages." Amex officials have said they expect 15 to 20
companies to list on the marketplace on the first day of
trading.
