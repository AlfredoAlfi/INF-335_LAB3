Business Brief -- Ford Motor Co.:
   Incentives to Be Extended,
   Increased Through March 31

incentive program. For example, buyers can now get a $2,000
rebate on the Ford Festiva, a $1,000 rebate on the Ford Probe

a rebate of $400 when they buy one of several Ford or Mercury

   FORD MOTOR Co. is cutting the incentives offered on
certain cars and trucks under a program that continues
through March 31. The discount on 1992 Mercury Grand Marquis
models, for example, will decrease to $500 from $1,000 under
the previous program. In last Thursday's edition, it was
incorrectly stated that Ford boosted its incentives.
