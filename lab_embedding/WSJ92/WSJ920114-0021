International Brief -- Hang Chong Investment Co.:
   Consortium That Acquired
   Hong Kong Firm Collapses
Citic Pacific yesterday offered to buy out the other
investors. The company said that the offer, which is expected
to be accepted, was motivated by its desire to consolidate
control over Hang Chong.
   "They don't see eye to eye on the company's future," said
an individual familiar with the group.
   Citic Pacific is offering 390 Hong Kong dollars (US$50.26)
for each of its partners' Hang Chong shares, or about HK$3
billion, representing a premium of 18% over the consortium's
original HK$330-a-share bid. The consortium paid HK$6.9
billion for Hang Chong, a leader in the colony's lucrative
automobile-distribution market.
