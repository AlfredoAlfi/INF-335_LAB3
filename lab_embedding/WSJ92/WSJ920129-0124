Business Brief -- Chips  Technologies Inc.:
   Deficit of $28.4 Million
   Posted for Second Quarter
Gordon A. Campbell, president and chief executive officer,
said intense competition in the chip market continued to hurt
prices. Last week, Chips said it planned to report a
second-quarter loss "substantially greater" than its
first-quarter loss of $9.9 million, or 73 cents a share. The
company added that it would begin a restructuring plan that
included plant consolidation and a 20% reduction in its work
force.
   For a six-month period, Chips had a loss of $38.3 million,
or $2.81 a share, compared with net income of $461,000, or
three cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 36% to
$76.7 million from $120.6 million.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Chips
shares closed at $11, down 50 cents.
