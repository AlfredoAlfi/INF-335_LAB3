Business Brief -- IPL Systems Inc.:
   Concern Set to Announce
   Pact With XL/Datacomp
Mr. Norton said the agreement with XL/Datacomp, a
subsidiary of Colorado-based disk drive maker Storage
Technology Corp., includes disk arrays and tape data-storage
systems for International Business Machines Corp.'s popular
AS/400 minicomputer, IPL's largest market.
   The Storage Technology unit will resell the IPL products
under its own name and work with IPL on development of future
technology.
   Mr. Norton said the deal also provides for additional
purchases toward the end of the contract. "This agreement
gives us a strong distribution channel while we develop and
implement our own direct sales capabilities," he said.
   He said "sales in the fourth quarter were good and we have
noticed a modest upturn in Europe." But he wouldn't forecast
the results, which are scheduled for release late this month.
