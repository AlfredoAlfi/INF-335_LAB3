Who's News:
   Charles McCormick
   To Resign From Post
   At Spice Company
Mr. McCormick would remain board chairman but wants to
retire by year's end, the spokesman said.
   Mr. Thomas, 60 years old, became chief operating officer
in 1987 and was elected president the following year.
   Mr. McCormick took over as chairman and chief executive
officer in 1987, and the company has thrived under his
command. McCormick has rid itself of sluggish divisions,
built new corporate offices in suburban Baltimore and
repackaged its retail products.
   During his tenure, sales jumped from $1.08 billion in 1987
to $1.4 billion last year, and net income leaped from $30.6
million to nearly $81 million.
   The spice, flavoring and condiment giant, based in Sparks,
Md., reported Monday that earnings were up 17% in its fiscal
first quarter, compared with the same period last year.
   Earnings rose to $17.3 million, or 21 cents a share, in
the quarter ended Feb. 29. That was up from $15.2 million, or
18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Analysts attributed the increase to strong performances in
the company's retail and overseas markets. McCormick also
sold its frozen chicken business, which proved less
profitable than expected, in November.
