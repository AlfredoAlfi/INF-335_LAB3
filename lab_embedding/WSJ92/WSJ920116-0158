MCN Expects '92 Net
   To Increase by 50%
   From '90, '91 Levels
If the weather returns to normal this year, the company
will earn about $2 a share from its gas distribution business
and another 20 cents a share from non-utility operations, Mr.
Coppola said. The company supplies natural gas to more than
one million customers scattered across Michigan, with about a
third of its gas sold in Detroit, he said.
   Directors are likely to consider a dividend increase next
May if this turns out to be a normal winter, Mr. Coppola
said. The company's current dividend is 41 cents quarterly,
or $1.64 a year, with the last increase in the 1990 fourth
quarter.
   Officials of the company were in Cleveland to talk to
securities analysts.
   Capital expenditures for 1992 will be about $140 million,
with $130 million of that invested in the gas utility
business, Mr. Coppola said. About $35 million of that
investment will be to develop an underground gas storage
facility. Capital spending in 1991 was about $155 million.
   The company is considering a public bond offering during
the current quarter, he said, but hasn't decided how large
the offering would be. Proceeds would be used for refunding
some maturing debt and for the capital spending program, he
said.
