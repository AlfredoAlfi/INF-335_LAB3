Technology Brief -- T Cell Sciences Inc.
   Biotechnology Firm Reaches
   Agreement With AB Astra
Under the accord, Astra will pay T Cell about $15 million
over 30 months as research milestones are reached, T Cell
said. The initial phase of the collaboration will involve
preclinical and preliminary clinical studies of the products,
the company added. T Cell said it expects more than $1.5
million of revenue from Astra through the third quarter of
fiscal 1992, ending today.
   Astra may additionally invest as much as $17 million over
several years following the initial phase of the
collaboration, T Cell said. Astra also may either fund or
perform half of the additional development of jointly
developed products, the company said.
   T Cell said that under the agreement, Astra has exclusive
world-wide marketing rights to products based on the
technology covered by the agreement, except for marketing
rights in North America for rheumatoid-arthritis products,
which T Cell retains. T Cell said it also retains world-wide
manufacturing rights for the products and will receive a
percentage of Astra's sales of them.
