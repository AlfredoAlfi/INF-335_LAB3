BankAmerica, Pressed
   By Regulators, Plans
   Bigger Deposit Sale
The sales will be a windfall for the bank's smaller
competitors who are successful bidders, allowing them to gain
huge chunks of market share. Potential bidders have been said
to include U.S. Bancorp, Portland, Ore.; First Bank System
Inc., Minneapolis; Washington Mutual Savings Bank, Seattle;
and Wells Fargo  Co., San Francisco.
   BankAmerica's actions could result in the sale of about
140 branches, people familiar with the bank said. But even at
the larger proposed amount, the spinoffs would barely make a
dent in the combined bank's $156 billion deposit base. The
bank said there could be a further revision of the plan, but
in any case, the terms of the merger agreement with Security
Pacific, based in Los Angeles, haven't been affected.
   The acquisition of Security Pacific, valued at $4.5
billion, is expected to be completed in the spring.
   Donald Crowley, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette  Woods Inc.,
San Francisco, said the plan's revision was expected. "The $4
billion I viewed as their opening ante," he said.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
BankAmerica shares were quoted at $36.375, down 25 cents.
