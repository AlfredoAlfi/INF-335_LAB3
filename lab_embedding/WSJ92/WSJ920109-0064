Grafton Group Unit
   Will Soon Eliminate
   107 Canadian Stores
The company has until Feb. 15 to prepare a plan to cut the
size of the unit by eliminating unprofitable stores.
   Grafton-Fraser said 525 jobs will be lost due to the
closures. It said 25 stores will close next week, and two
retail chains, Madison and Bimini, will shut down completely.
Further store closings could lie ahead as the restructuring
proceeds, Grafton-Fraser said.
   Grafton Group also is seeking a buyer for its Maher Inc.
shoe retailing chain. And it is cutting the number of
Seiferts women's apparel stores it owns and operates in the
U.S.
