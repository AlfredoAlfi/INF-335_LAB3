Credit Rating Brief -- Penn Central Corp.:
   Debt Ratings Are Placed
   Under Review by Moody's
Moody's will review Penn Central's remaining operations --
insurance, defense service operations and smaller
manufacturing and energy businesses -- to see if they'll
generate enough cash to pay the company's debts.
   A Penn Central spokesman said he wasn't surprised by the
review. But, he said, "we will attempt to structure the
spinoff in such a way that {the debt} continues to be an
investment-grade security."
   Moody's said it will also review how the spinoff would
affect Cincinnati-based Penn Central's balance sheet and
ability to meet its debt obligations.
