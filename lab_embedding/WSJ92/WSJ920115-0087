Notable  Quotable
A Western consortium is currently at work modernizing the
phone system of Moscow. One of our Freeman contributors
recently spoke with a member of the consortium, who told him
that Moscow's original phone system was installed prior to
1906 by Swedish engineers working for the czarist government.
When our contributor asked him what proportion of Moscow's
current telephone system dates back to before 1906, he
replied, "At least 90 percent."
