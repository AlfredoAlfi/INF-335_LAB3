International:
   Maxwell Creditors May Get
   Only Partial Policy Payout
Mr. Maxwell died at sea Nov. 5 under circumstances that
haven't been clarified. His family contends his death
resulted from a heart attack that caused him to fall from his
yacht and drown. Arguing that this amounted to an accident,
they called for the full #20 million to be paid on his
insurance policy. But an independent pathologist acting for
the insurers said he found no evidence to support the
hypothesis of accidental death.
   Following the collapse of Mr. Maxwell's business empire,
the companies concerned, including Mr. Maxwell's flagship,
Maxwell Communication Corp., are in the hands of
court-appointed administrators. Acting in the interests of
creditors, the administrators are eager to recover as much as
possible from the insurance policy. Price Waterhouse,
administrators for Maxwell Communication, is taking legal
advice, a spokesman said.
   Mr. Maxwell's insurers contend the burden of proof
regarding a possible accident lies with the Maxwell companies
and have offered a partial payment as a compromise.
