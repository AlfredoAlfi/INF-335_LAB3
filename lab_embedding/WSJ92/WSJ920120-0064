Business Brief -- Adolph Coors Co.:
   Beer Sales in '91 Reached
   Record 19.5 Million Barrels
Coors said its increases came from growth in Coors Light
and Keystone Light sales. The Golden, Colo., company also
expanded its international distribution and introduced three
new brands.
   The company didn't project earnings for the fourth quarter
or the year, but said its earnings for 1991 would "be
affected by increased costs associated with capacity
expansion, advertising, property abandonments and
administrative overhead." Earlier, Coors announced it is
reducing its staff by about 60 people, mainly in
administrative areas.
   Separately, Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported its sales volume
dropped in 1991 by 0.5% to 86 million barrels from about 86.5
million barrels. The company said it expects to report record
earnings for 1991 in spite of the decrease. Both Anheuser and
Coors reported increases in market share, Coors to 10% of the
U.S. beer market and Anheuser to 44.1%.
