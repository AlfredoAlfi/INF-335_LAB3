Blockbuster's Bid
   To Acquire Cityvision
   Gains 50.21% Support
Blockbuster, the largest U.S. video-rental chain, added
that the offer has been extended until Feb. 12.
   The narrow margin of support, said a Blockbuster
executive, may be explained in part by a campaign recently
launched by two Cityvision shareholders against Blockbuster's
bid. The two holders criticized the offer as too low and
urged fellow shareholders to vote them in as Cityvision's new
board.
   The two holders, however, never made a competing financial
bid. For that reason, said Blockbuster's treasurer, Joseph
Burke, the company expects holders of almost 90% of
Cityvision stock to approve the bid by Feb. 12.
   "Now that it's obvious there's not a competing offer,
there will be more interest," Mr. Burke said. Since
Blockbuster has won majority support, he expects other
stockholders will sign on more readily.
   Although Blockbuster originally planned to complete the
acquisition with approval of holders of 90% of shares, the
company said it will now close the transaction whether or not
that many shareholders approve. The company said it expects
to complete the acquisition by March.
