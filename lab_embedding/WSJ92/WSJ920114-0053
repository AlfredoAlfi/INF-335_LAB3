TransCanada Project
   Will Be Reconsidered
   By Agency in Canada
In a previous ruling, the board denied TransCanada
PipeLines' request to build the 20.6-kilometer (about
12-mile) extension, saying the proposed pipeline's markets
could be better served through "less expensive and
environmentally superior means" by expanding the company's
existing Niagara Line.
   The board said its decision to review the ruling follows a
decision by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulation Commission
that approved the Empire State Pipeline project. TransCanada
PipeLines is a gas pipeline concern based here.
