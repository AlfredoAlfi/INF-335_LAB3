Pepper...and Salt
Good old American know-how
   Means pride in all that we do,
   But let's not underestimate
   Good old American know-who.

   Time races by
   From day to day.
   It speeds right along
   Its own merry way.
   But two words, I find,
   Slow its rapid ride:
   That's when my dentist
   Says, "Open wide."
