Business Brief -- Nova Corp. of Alberta:
   Stelco Unit Awarded Job
   For Large-Diameter Pipe
The pipe will be supplied by Stelco's Welland Tube Works
in Ontario and Camrose Works in Alberta.
   Although Nova said it expects one of the two pipeline
projects to drop out, it said the lead-time required for pipe
manufacture made it necessary to award the contract as soon
as possible. Both projects say they expect to begin gas
supplies on Nov. 1, 1993.
   Costs associated with the pipe order and other components
of the proposed pipeline projects are covered by irrevocable
letters of credit arranged between Nova and the two project
sponsors.
   Stelco is a steel manufacturer based in Hamilton, Ontario.
