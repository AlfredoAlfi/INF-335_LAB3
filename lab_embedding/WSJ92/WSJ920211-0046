Business Brief -- Morrison Knudsen Corp.:
   Company Gets Rail Car Job
   With Value of $155 Million
The company, which has seen profitability decline in its
main engineering and construction business, has been working
to increase its rail transit volume. Last month, Morrison
Knudsen won a $380 million contract to provide rail cars for
a commuter system in Illinois, and last year, the company was
selected to build a $1.1 billion rapid transit system in
Honolulu.
   Morrison Knudsen's order from the California Department of
Transportation is for rail cars that will be used by
commuters throughout the state. The contract is unrelated to
last month's decision by the Los Angeles County
Transportation Commission to cancel a $121 million contract
awarded to a unit of Sumitomo Corp., in favor of plans to
spend transit dollars domestically.
