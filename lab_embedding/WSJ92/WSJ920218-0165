Pepper...and Salt
At night when I can't sleep,
   Instead of counting sheep,
   I start composing poems in my head --
   But by dawn's early light
   The great rhymes have taken flight
   And I end up with verse like this instead.
   -- George O. Ludcke.

   Fired Up
                                                                                                       

   When someone hands me a card marked
   "Consultant," I'm curious to know
   From what job he or she was let go,
   And as a resultant
   Became a consultant.
   -- Peter Friedman.
