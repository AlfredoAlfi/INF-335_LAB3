Bowater Moving Headquarters
"It no longer makes organizational sense to maintain two
overlapping headquarters functions," said Anthony P. Gammie,

pulp and paper operations were moved to South Carolina in

   The Darien headquarters employs fewer than 70 people. The
transfer is expected to be completed next year.
