Business Brief -- Comcast Corp.:
   Cable TV Firm Completes
   Purchase of Cellular Systems
Previously, Comcast agreed to pay $550 million either all
in cash or cash and some stock, and to issue preferred stock
with a $450 million liquidation preference and an 8%
cumulative dividend. Terms of redemption of the preferred
were similar to the terms of the zero-coupon notes.
   Comcast officials noted that the combination of its
cellular properties, mainly in New Jersey and Delaware, with
the Metromedia properties will bring together adjoining areas
serving a total population of 7.3 million. In addition to the
Philadelphia area, Metromedia has cellular systems in New
Brunswick and Long Branch, N.J.
