Business Brief -- International Telecharge Inc.:
   New Credit Line Is Used
   For Payment to Chairman
Under a previous agreement, Mr. Haan, who recently bought
33% of Telecharge's stock for $4 million and helped it
acquire the Telesphere assets, was to receive a royalty of
10% of the net operating revenue from Telesphere's customer
base.
   The company said the royalty prepayment was made partly
because Mr. Haan pledged $5 million as added security for the
credit line.
