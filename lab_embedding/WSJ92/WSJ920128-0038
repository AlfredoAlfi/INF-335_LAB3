Business Brief -- Sharp Corp.:
   Japanese Firm Discussing
   Apple Computer Ventures
Officials at Apple Computer's Japanese unit declined to
comment on the talks.
   The Sankei Shimbun, a Japanese daily, reported that Sharp
was particularly interested in gaining a foothold in the
growing multimedia sector, in which Apple Computer has a
lead. For Apple, Sharp's leading technology in liquid crystal
displays would expand the U.S. company's business
opportunities, the newspaper said.
