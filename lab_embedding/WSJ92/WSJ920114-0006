Who's News:
   Glauber Is Leaving
   Treasury Post to Take
   Position at Harvard
Mr. Glauber, who has served as undersecretary since May
1989, played a major role in writing legislation to overhaul
the savings-and-loan industry. He also guided the development
of capital requirements for government-sponsored enterprises
and the enactment of proposals resulting from the Brady
Commission report on the 1987 stock market crash.
   Most recently, Mr. Glauber helped reshape the Treasury
auction process in the wake of the Salomon Brothers Inc.
scandal, and has helped push the Bush administration's
banking proposals in Congress.
   The Treasury didn't say who will succeed Mr. Glauber, but
Jay Powell, assistant secretary for domestic finance, is said
to be a leading candidate.
