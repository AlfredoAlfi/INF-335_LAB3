Business Brief -- GenCorp Inc.:
   Company Expects to Make
   Profit in Fiscal 1st Quarter
For the 1992 first quarter, Mr. Reynolds said, sales of
Aerojet aerospace parts should be flat, and a recent
announcement about defense program cancellations won't affect
first-quarter sales. Sales at the company's automotive and
polymer products units are also expected to rise, he said.
   The Fairlawn, Ohio, company cited long-term growth
opportunities in so-called smart weapons, Strategic Defense
Initiative programs, automotive vehicle sealing and vibration
control products, latex coatings, wallcovering and tennis
balls.
