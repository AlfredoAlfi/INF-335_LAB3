Several Groups Show
   Interest in Making Bid
   For First Capital Life
Thomas Sutton, Pacific Mutual chairman and chief executive
officer, was involved last year with an unsuccessful offer by
an insurance industry group for Executive Life Insurance Co.,
another failed company seized by California regulators.
   First Capital creditors also "hope to make a bid" for the
company but haven't yet submitted a letter of intent, said a
spokesman for the creditors committee.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. has already put
forward a plan to inject $50 million into First Capital Life
and to guarantee the full value of policyholders' accounts,
among other terms. Shearson, which has a 28% stake in the
parent company, is a unit of American Express Co.
   John Garamendi, California insurance commissioner, has
expressed support for the plan but has said the department
would give other interested parties a chance to top that bid
before an April 10 deadline. In the meantime, prospective
bidders who meet certain criteria will be allowed to review
confidential First Capital Life information, the department
spokesman said.
