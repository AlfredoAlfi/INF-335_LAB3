International Brief -- Union Bank of Switzerland:
   Net Income Rebounded 34%
   In 1991 From a Weak 1990
The profit increase came despite a 31% rise in
depreciation, valuation adjustments and provisions for losses
to 1.7 billion francs from 1.3 billion francs. The bank
benefited from more interest income, bigger interest-rate
differentials and more securities-trading income. Dividends
held unchanged at 135 francs per bearer share and 27 francs
per registered share.
   Net interest income rose 23% to 3.3 billion francs from
2.69 billion francs. Profit from trading in securities,
foreign exchange, bank notes, precious metals and interest
bearing instruments grew 44% to 1.27 billion francs.
   UBS executives said further profit improvements were
expected this year from trading and sales activities,
portfolio management and interest-related business.
