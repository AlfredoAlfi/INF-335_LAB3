Business Brief -- Sport Supply Group Inc.:
   Company Ends Discussions
   Over Possible Acquisition
Sport Supply, which is 27%-owned by BSN Corp., didn't
disclose what it paid for the rights from MacGregor Sports
Product Inc., Simpsonville, S.C. It said it expects the
agreement to generate about $5 million in added revenue in
1992 and $10 million or more in future years as it converts
the "vast majority" of its 5,000 manufactured and distributed
sports products to the MacGregor brand.
   The company said its fourth-quarter revenue was flat
because of fewer shipping days and a weak economy, but it
said it believes recent analyst projections of earnings of
$1.10 a share and revenue of $60 million in 1992 are "in the
range of acceptability." It said it expects to report 1991
results in about 10 days.
