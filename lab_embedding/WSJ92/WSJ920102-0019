Business Brief -- Northeast Utilities:
   Company Urges Proceeding
   With Purchase of Utility
In September, Northeast said that a previous FERC ruling
could derail the $2.3 billion acquisition. Regulators in
Connecticut and New Hampshire said the ruling appeared unfair
to their ratepayers who had paid for building the
transmission lines.
   Northeast said it "expressed caution on the particulars"
of the revised FERC staff proposal. But it said those issues
could be resolved "on a case-by-case basis following the
merger proceeding, when NU will be filing transmission
tariffs."
   In December, the boards of the two utilities extended
their merger agreement to April 30. Under PS New Hampshire's
bankruptcy reorganization plan, the deal had been set for
completion by Dec. 31.
