Business Brief -- TCBY Enterprises Inc.:
   Frozen-Yogurt Retailer Has
   $1.4 Million Quarterly Loss
The company said its selling and administrative expense
rose by $1 million, or 8%, during the quarter, largely
because of an increase in company-operated stores.
   For the year, TCBY had net income of $8 million, or 31
cents a share, a drop of almost 60% from $20 million, or 75
cents a share, in fiscal 1990. It said revenue fell almost
15%, to $128.9 million from $151.3 million, largely because
store additions slowed, reducing its revenue from initial
franchise fees and equipment sales.
