Amex Agrees to Delist
   Continental Airlines Stock
"It is incumbent upon us and the exchange to protect
investors, particularly the small investor, from price swings
in an issue that is destined to be withdrawn," a Continental
spokesman said. Even though Continental's plan for
eliminating common shares had received plenty of notice,
investors were still buying and selling the stock.
