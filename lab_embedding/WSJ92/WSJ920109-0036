Bush to Seek Tax Cuts Offset

   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Although the 1990 budget law forbids such maneuvers,
administration officials recently have been arguing that such
a move would preserve "fiscal discipline." President Bush
himself has made clear that he wants any peace dividend to
finance either tax cuts or deficit reduction. Some Democratic
leaders of Congress, in contrast, want to spend the money on
domestic programs.
   In a statement issued jointly with the Japanese prime
minister, President Bush affirmed his commitment to reduce
the U.S. budget deficit "over the medium term," a phrase that
allows for an increase in the deficit this year.
