Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 36.9% involved
stock-index arbitrage, up from 33.3% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 33.5% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 45% involved
trading for customers. An additional 21.5% was executed by
firms using principal positions to facilitate customer
trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most of their
program trading for their own account, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities and First Bos- ton.
