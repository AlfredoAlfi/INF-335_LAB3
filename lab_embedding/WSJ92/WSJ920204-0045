   Wellcome Says Drug Shows
   Results in Early HIV Stage
The British company said the findings support the use of
Retrovir, known clinically as zidovudine and used to combat
some effects of the human immunodeficiency virus, "at an
earlier stage of HIV infection," broadening its use and
potential market.
   Wellcome said any wider application would still require
regulatory approval, so the trial results won't have an
impact on the company's current revenue. Still, the
announcement sent the pharmaceutical concern's shares surging
24 pence to #11.74 ($20.97) in late trading on London's stock
exchange.
   In the clinical trials, Wellcome said, preliminary results
showed the probability of the disease progressing after two
years of treatment was 28% for recipients of a placebo but
only 14% for those treated with Retrovir. A full analysis of
the drug trials "is expected to confirm these findings,"
Wellcome said.
