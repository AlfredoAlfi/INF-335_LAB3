Credit Ratings
CORNING Inc. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
lowered to single-A-2 from single-A-1 its long-term debt
ratings of this Corning, N.Y., specialty glass, ceramic
products and telecommunications concern, affecting $470
million in debt. But the rating agency confirmed Corning's
Prime-1 short-term rating for commercial paper. Moody's said
the downgrade stemmed from potential erosion in the value of
Corning's 50% investment in Dow Corning Corp. and the
vulnerability of Dow Corning's dividend, which runs at about
10% of the company's cash flow. Dow Corning, a joint venture
involving Corning Inc. and Dow Chemical Co., is defending
itself against potentially significant product liability
litigation in relation to its silicone breast implant
products.
