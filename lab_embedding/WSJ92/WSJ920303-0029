Business Brief -- Vishay Intertechnology Inc.:
   Malvern, Pa., Firm Acquires
   19% Stake in Roederstein
A Vishay spokesman said Roederstein currently is breaking
even on operations, but is having short-term liquidity
problems and is working to restructure its bank debt. It
hired Vishay to advise it, and at the same time agreed to
sell the stake, he said.
   Vishay also makes electronic parts, such as resistors,
sensors and capacitors. Last week, it completed the purchase
of the tantalum capacitor and thick film businesses of
Sprague Technologies Inc. for $120 million, financed with a
line of credit.
