Panama Pays Arrears
   On Loans From IMF
   And the World Bank
Separately, the International Monetary Fund announced that
Panama has paid off $253 million in overdue financial
obligations to the IMF. As a result, the agency said it
restored Panama's access to its financial assistance.
   Panama has requested an IMF standby credit for its
economic program for 1992 and 1993 and other financial
support, the IMF said. Panama had been declared ineligible to
use IMF general facilities on June 30, 1989.
