Credit Ratings:
   Enserch Corp. Ratings
   On Debt, Preferred
   Lowered by Moody's
Moody's downgraded Enserch senior debt to Baa-2 from
Baa-1, its subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2 and
preferred stock to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Enserch's Prime-2
short-term debt rating was confirmed, and its shelf
registration rated (P)Baa-2.
   The ratings service said it expected low prices and weak
demand for gas will continue to lessen profitability in the
Dallas company's oil and gas exploration and production
business, preventing significant improvement in debt
protection measurements. Moody's added, however, that
Enserch's credit quality will be supported by the stable
performance of its gas transmission and distribution system,
and by the declining risk profile of its engineering and
constructive segment.
