Business Brief -- BTR PLC:
   Firm May Sell Its Interest
   In Hawker Siddely Canada
Based on current prices on the Toronto stock exchange,
BTR's entire Hawker Siddeley Canada stake would be valued at
around 118 million Canadian dollars (US$98.5 million).
   BTR has been trying to digest its acquisition last year of
Hawker-Siddeley Group PLC, a U.K. engineering group, which
cost #1.5 billion ($2.56 billion) and included the Canadian
business.
   Also, BTR said it agreed to sell its 24% stake in the
Australian timber products group Bunnings Ltd. for the
equivalent of #17.8 million. It said the buyer was West
Farmers Ltd., based in Perth. The Bunnings stake was acquired
as part of the Hawker Siddeley acquisition.
