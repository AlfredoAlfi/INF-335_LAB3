Scandinavian Insurers
   To Keep Discussing
   Possible Merger Pact
"The parties agreed not to comment, at the present time,
on the matters under discussion," the statement said. But
that wording still signaled progress, analysts suggested,
considering the staunch public opposition previously mounted
by Skandia's chief executive, Bjoern Wolrath, against any
such merger proposal.
   People familiar with the talks said the chief executives
of UNI Storebrand, Hafnia and Skandia reached agreement
earlier this week on the rough outline of a merger plan
spanning both their domestic and international operations.
Such a combined concern would rank among the half-dozen
biggest European insurers measured by premium income.
   UNI Storebrand and Hafnia remain avid suitors -- but it's
still too early to gauge Skandia's ultimate intentions,
people familiar with the talks said. One person suggested
that yesterday's statement had been drafted to allow one or
more of the parties absolute freedom to withdraw at a later
stage with no major consequences. The next scheduled meeting
of Skandia's board, which comes early next month, looms as an
important checkpoint for progress in the merger talks, one
analyst added.
