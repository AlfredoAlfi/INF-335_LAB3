Latest Appeal of Execution
   Is Denied in California
In 1990, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge in California
stayed Mr. Harris's execution after an appeal based on tests
purportedly showing his brain is damaged in a way that
impairs his judgment and causes impulsive, violent behavior.
Mr. Harris's attorneys argued that the evidence showed the
murders weren't premeditated, which would rule out a death
sentence under California law.
   The appeals court later denied Mr. Harris's petition,
prompting an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was
denied last week. A new motion was filed in the California
appeals court based on new evidence that a 1976
electro-encephalogram test of Mr. Harris's brain was faulty.
The test, indicating his brain was normal, was cited by the
circuit court when it rejected his appeal.
   Now that appeal also has been denied. The case moves to
San Diego Superior Court, where Mr. Harris's execution date
is scheduled to be set Friday.
