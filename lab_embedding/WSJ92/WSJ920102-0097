Credit Ratings
CAROLCO PICTURES Inc. (Los Angles) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it reduced its ratings on two classes of
Carolco debt, apparently affecting about $85 million face
value of securities. Moody's said it reduced to Caa from
single-B-2 its rating on the $67.5 million face value of
Carolco's 14% senior notes due 1993. The company also cut to
Ca from single-B-3 its rating on the about $17.1 million face
value of Carolco's 13% senior subordinated notes due 1996.
Moody's didn't give a reason for the downgrades. However,
Carolco announced Monday that it would redeem its 14% senior
notes at prices between 65 cents and 85 cents on the
dollar-lower than earlier expected. Carolco also said its
president and chief executive officer, Peter Hoffman, was
leaving the entertainment company.
