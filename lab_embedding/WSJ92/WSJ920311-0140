Business Brief:
   Fluor Unit Wins Jobs
   Of Over $300 Million,
   Seeks East Bloc Work
After the company's annual meeting here yesterday, Mr.
McCraw also said Fluor is in "detailed discussions" with
several oil and gas concerns looking to build hydrocarbon
projects in Russia and the other former republics. He said
the work could be for so-called "mega-projects," with values
of $1 billion or more. However, he cautioned that the timing
for reaching any such agreements is uncertain, given the
current political climate in the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
   "Our clients are having trouble determining who the
leaders are," he said, adding that "right now, those people
are being very difficult in negotiations with our clients."
Price and the division of profits are major stumbling blocks,
he said. He noted that Fluor is looking for similar projects
in other East bloc countries; the company recently opened an
office in eastern Germany.
   Mr. McCraw said Fluor continues to look for work in
Kuwait, a search it has been pursuing since the Gulf War. A
few weeks ago, Fluor lost a contract competition for refinery
work in Kuwait to Foster Wheeler Corp.
