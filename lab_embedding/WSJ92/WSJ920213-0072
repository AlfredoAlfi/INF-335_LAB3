California Official Offers
   New Plan for Health Care
The commissioner, John Garamendi, can't mandate
health-insurance reforms, which must be enacted by the
Legislature or by California voters in a ballot initiative.
And several competing proposals are already circulating among
legislators, including one backed by the California Medical
Association that may appear on the November ballot.
   The new plan is meant to become "part of the debate" over
health care, said Mr. Garamendi, adding in an interview that
the plan will be sent as a bill to the Legislature next
month. If lawmakers rebuff the plan, Mr. Garamendi said, he
may place it before voters as an initiative.
   Insurer groups expressed skepticism about the
commissioner's plan. "This is a concept that has a lot of
intuitive appeal," said Mark Webb, a lawyer for the American
Insurance Association. "But when you start to look more
carefully at how these services are to be provided, it gets
much more difficult to see the cost benefits the commissioner
is talking about."
