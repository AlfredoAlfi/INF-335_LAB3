Business Brief -- International Corona Corp.:
   Firm Will Pay Homestake
   If Acquired by Third Party
As previously reported, Homestake plans to offer 0.35
share for each Corona share. Corona officials say the offer
values each Corona share at 6.28 Canadian dollars
(U.S.$5.26), based on Homestake's stock price before the
acquisition agreement was announced. Homestake, based in San
Francisco, and Corona, based in Vancouver, British Columbia,
are both gold-mining companies.
   Dundee also said it agreed to tender its shares to the
Homestake offer, unless a higher offer for Corona is made.
Dundee, which would swap its Corona shares for a 6.8% holding
in Homestake, said it also agreed not to raise or lower this
stake except under certain circumstances.
