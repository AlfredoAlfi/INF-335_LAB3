Business Brief -- Wellcome PLC:
   Big Secondary Stock Offer
   Considered to Be Imminent
Yesterday, a Wellcome spokesman declined to comment on the
news reports.
   On Friday, Wellcome's stock climbed nine pence to 1126
pence a share in heavy trading on London markets. Analysts
initially attributed the price jump to the long-awaited
announcement on Friday that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved Wellcome's anti-viral medicine,
Zovirax, for treatment of chicken pox. But some analysts
suggested that rumors of a possible Wellcome Trust share sale
also were heating up in London by week's end.
