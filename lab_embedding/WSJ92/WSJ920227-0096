International:
   U.S. Probes Possibility
   Of Hong Kong Link
   In Shipments to China
The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London said Tuesday that
U.S. customs had evidence that high-sophistication systems
were transferred to China via Hong Kong approximately two
months ago.
   The report said customs authorities were investigating six
Hong Kong companies, some of which have already been linked
to China's weapons-purchasing authorities.
   While the U.S. has said it will lift some sanctions
imposed on China, the Telegraph said some of the systems
shipped to China -- including Vax computers that are fast
enough to run Patriot missile guidance systems -- would still
be restricted.
   The State Department said last Friday that the sanctions
were being lifted because China had promised to abide by the
Missile Technology Control Regime, which aims to restrict the
spread of advanced missile technology and weaponry.
