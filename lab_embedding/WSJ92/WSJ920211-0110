Bank of New Zealand Rate Cuts
"We want to play our part in ensuring that the confidence
currently being shown in the economy by the business
community develops momentum,," said Tom Tennent, deputy group
chief executive of Bank of New Zealand. "The rate move will
help reinforce the {economic} recovery already apparent in a
number of sectors."
   The sustained reduction in interest rates over the last
year has been a "realistic response to economic conditions,"
Mr. Tennent said. The latest rate cut is being made in
anticipation of a further lowering of deposit interest rates,
he said.
   Meanwhile, ASB Bank Ltd. said it will cut its home
mortgage lending rate to 10.4% from 11.2%, effective
immediately for new loans and effective March 26 for existing
loans. ASB, a small commercial bank, also said it is cutting
the rates charged on a range of commercial and overdraft
facilities by 0.75 percentage point across the board.
