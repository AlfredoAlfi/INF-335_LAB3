Law:
   Protection of News Sources
   On Anita Hill Is Urged
The special counsel, New York lawyer Peter Fleming, was
appointed last fall to investigate leaks of Ms. Hill's
allegations. Mr. Fleming didn't return calls seeking comment
yesterday.
   A subpoena would "necessarily" seek the reporters'
confidential sources and "could not be enforced consistent
with the commands of the Constitution," lawyers for the
Journal and the New York Times wrote in a joint letter to
Robert C. Byrd, the Senate's president pro tempore. The
Washington Post made a similar argument in a separate letter.
   The Journal/Times letter argued that a subpoena wouldn't
hold up in court because the counsel hasn't yet exhausted
other ways of tracking down the leak, such as questioning
senators and staffers with access to Ms. Hill's charges.
   More broadly, the letter asked the Senate to declare that
journalists may protect the identities of confidential
sources in Senate proceedings. The letter said that issue
hasn't been conclusively settled in modern times.
