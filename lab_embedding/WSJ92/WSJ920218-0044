Posner Suspended by Judge
   From Control Over DWG
On Friday, however, in U.S. District Court in Cleveland,
Judge Thomas D. Lambros said that Mr. Posner has defied the
terms of the settlement and "continues to stomp on the rights
of shareholders, officers and directors, by reigning over DWG
as if it were his personal fiefdom."
   The judge temporarily suspended Mr. Posner from exercising
control of his holdings in the company. He also barred the
73-year-old executive from selling his 46.3% stake in DWG and
ordered the salaries of Mr. Posner and his son Steven, vice
president of the company, placed in trust. In 1991, Mr.
Posner received cash compensation of $3.6 million from DWG,
while Steven Posner received $665,000.
   An attorney for Mr. Posner, Donald Glazer, said he would
"immediately" appeal the judge's order. "There was no
hearing, no advocates, no notice" of the judge's action, Mr.
Glazer said.
   A hearing on the order is scheduled for Monday.
