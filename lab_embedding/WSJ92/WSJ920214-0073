   Rate of 6.4 Million Vehicles
   Topped January's Pace,
   Fueling Recovery Hopes

The latest results also outpaced the 6.1 million-vehicle
sales pace set in early February last year. Overall, domestic
car and truck sales climbed 23.8% in early February from a
year ago, a period that was severely depressed by both war
and recession.
   What particularly encouraged analysts and industry
executives in early February was the buoyance in truck sales
and in sales of several entry-level car lines.
   Sales of domestically built vans, pickup trucks and
off-road vehicles, generically grouped as "light trucks,"
outstripped their year-ago performance by 42.8%. "Trucks may
lead us out of the recession," J.C. Perkins, the vice
president in charge of General Motors Corp's Chevrolet
division, said last week. "It's true in every recovery.
Trucks always lead cars."
   But analysts' optimism is guarded by continuing low levels
of consumer confidence, and worries over job security. "We're
encouraged and cautiously optimistic," said Stephen Gurski,
an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   Importantly, the sales increases are coming despite the
cutback of deliveries to big rental-car companies. Retail
customers, who provide higher profit margins than fleet
buyers, apparently are doing more buying.
   In January, for example, sales to retail customers of GM's
Buick LeSabre increased 22.2%, while such sales of GM's
Cadillac Eldorado jumped 72.2% and retail sales of its
redesigned Seville nearly tripled. Overall, Cadillac's retail
business was up 25% in January from a year ago. "There seems
to be more interest in buying a car now," said Peter Gerosa,
Cadillac's division's general sales manager.
   Ford Motor Co.'s car sales were bouyed by entry-level
family model Tempo and its new Taurus.
   Because of incomplete data, it's unclear whether the Big
Three, which scored a combined 15.2% sales gain, are
benefiting from various "Buy America" campaigns.
   Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Corp.
posted strong car sales gains in the period for the cars they
built in the U.S. Toyota's sales jumped 58.9%, Honda's
domestic car sales climbed 24.4% and Nissan Motor registered
a 29% sales gain. Honda's strong showing was led by its
Accord, which the company is boosting with an attractive
lease package. Toyota's success stemmed from its new Camry
car, whose sales doubled from the year-ago period and is
rapidly gaining acceptance as a bigger, midsized car.
   The other three Japanese companies that build cars in the
U.S. showed sales declines, most notably Mazda Motor Corp.,
whose domestic sales slid 49.4%. A Mazda spokesman attributed
the decline to lower demand for the cars it builds in the
U.S., because the company is phasing out those models to
replace them with new ones this spring.
   But overall, yesterday's results sparked optimism in the
industry. "There's no doubt about it, those tentative signs
of strength we saw in January were real," said Tom Webb,
chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association. "Unless politicians do something silly to zap
consumer confidence, this recovery will endure."
   The Big Three auto makers rose in a generally weak stock
market. GM closed at $36.625, up 75 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Ford finished at $35.25, up 62.5
cents, while Chrysler Corp. ended the day at $15.125, up 12.5
cents.
