Philippines, Bank Panel
   Reach Agreement on Debt
The agreement provides for the sale of new bonds, which
will include the right to convert every $4 of debt
outstanding into securities for every dollar of bonds
purchased. In addition, the agreement calls for the swap of
current debt for new securities.
   The recent agreement between the Philippines and the
International Monetary Fund over the country's economic
program paved the way for the final agreement, which was
tentatively set in August. Currently, the Philippines' total
foreign debt stands at $29 billion.
