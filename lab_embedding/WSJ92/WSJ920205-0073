Congress Approves
   Another Extension
   Of Aid for Jobless
The measure was approved in the House, 404-8, and later in
the Senate, 94-2. The bill's fast track contrasts with the
four-month fight last year over starting the emergency
program. Mr. Bush opposed the Democrats' initiative, but he
relented as the economy sagged and his popularity fell.
   White House spokesman Gary Foster said last night that
President Bush is "very pleased that both houses have acted."
Mr. Bush is expected to sign the bill soon after he receives
it, according to the spokesman.
   The Senate rejected, 88-8, an attempt by Republican Sen.
Hank Brown of Colorado to derail the bill on the ground that
it added to the deficit. But even the Senate GOP leader,
Robert Dole of Kansas, disagreed. The measure's supporters,
in concert with the White House, claimed some surplus funds
to pay most of the bill's cost. The rest of the funds would
come from larger advance income-tax payments from some
corporations.
