SRI Looks Into Fatal Blast
   Linked to Cold Fusion Test
One scientist had lifted a canister containing a hydrogen
isotope and a metal out of a water bath and placed it on the
side of the bath shortly before the explosion occurred, the
spokesman said. "At this time, we and the authorities have
started to investigate," he said.
   The scientists were studying the interaction between a
heavy form of hydrogen called deuterium and a metal,
palladium. A much-disputed theory holds that when the two
elements are combined, large amounts of energy may be created
in a process called cold fusion. Three years ago, two
researchers claimed to have proven the theory, but their
findings were criticized by other scientists who said they
were unable to duplicate the researchers' results.
