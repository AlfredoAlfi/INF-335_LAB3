Business Brief -- America West Airlines:
   Narrowed $47.8 Million Loss
   Posted for Fourth Quarter
The airline, based in Phoenix, Ariz., said the 1991
fourth-quarter results were affected by a $10.7 million
reorganization expense and the 1990 fourth quarter by a $2
million gain for repurchase of convertible subordinated
debentures.
   For the year, America West reported a widened loss of
$213.7 million, or $10 a share, on revenue of $1.42 billion,
compared with a loss of $74.7 million or $4.15 a share, on
revenue of $1.32 billion in 1990.
   The company said the airline industry had the most
difficult period in the history of aviation, losing a total
of $6 billion in 1991. America West Airlines filed for
Chapter 11 protection on June 27.
   Continuing its reorganization, the airline arranged
additional financing of about $200 million and awaits
regulatory approval for the sale of its Nagoya, Japan, route
for $15 million.
   December traffic surpassed the company's earlier
projections, said Michael Conway, president and chief
executive officer, in a statement. "We anticipate first
quarter 1992 results will be better than any of the quarters
we experienced during 1991," he said.
