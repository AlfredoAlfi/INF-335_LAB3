Britain's BOC Group
   Says Its Pretax Profit
   Rose 13% for Period
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
BOC noted that the latest results were helped by favorable
currency movements, and estimated that its earnings growth
would have been limited to 9% without them. This represents a
reversal from the year-earlier period, when adverse currency
moves linked to a weak dollar lopped #10 million off earnings
at the pretax level.
   BOC said that the latest earnings gain was made in a tough
trading environment, with no improvement seen in any of the
economies where the company operates. The company also saw a
decline in growth in the important Far Eastern market.
   BOC had an 11% rise in pretax operating profit. Interest
expenses edged up to #18.9 million from #18 million, however.
After tax and minority interests, BOC's attributable profit
for the quarter was #50.1 million compared with #43 million.
No extraordinary items were recorded.
   BOC didn't comment on its outlook for full-year results.
For the year ended Sept. 30, BOC posted pretax profit of
#310.1 million on sales of #2.84 billion. Patrick Rich,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in January that
current-year results should match market expectations, which
are for pretax profit between #345 million and #380 million.
