Business Brief -- Playboy Enterprises Inc.:
   Company Reports 36% Drop
   In Fiscal Second-Period Net
Without those items, Playboy said earnings would have
increased 33% to $800,000, or four cents a share, from
$600,000, or three cents a share, last year.
   Revenue in the latest period rose 8% to $49.9 million from
$46.1 million.
   Playboy said its improved results reflect a sizable
increase in earnings at its entertainment group, which
benefited in part from higher domestic home video sales from
new releases.
   The publishing group posted a slight earnings improvement
despite "soft" advertising sales, Playboy said, citing a
"strong performance" at its catalog business. The company's
flagship Playboy magazine, meanwhile, reported lower results
due primarily to a 15% decline in advertising revenue on a
20% drop in advertising pages.
