Business Brief -- Grafton Group Ltd.:
   Maher Inc. Shoe Store Unit
   Wins Shield From Creditors
Robert Holland, Maher's president, said he expects Maher
could be sold within a month to a prospective investor, whom
he declined to identify. Otherwise, he said, Maher has 60
days to file a restructuring plan with the court.
   Mr. Holland said Maher, which operates 282 shoe stores
under the Maher, Julia and Footpath chains, owes creditors 20
million Canadian dollars (US$17.1 million). A restructuring
likely would result in the closing of 100 stores, with the
loss of about 600 jobs, he said.
