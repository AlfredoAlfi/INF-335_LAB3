Who's News:
   Bank of Scotland Unit,
   Citizen's Financial,
   Names Fish President
In his new post, Mr. Fish will oversee planned expansion
in New England. He said the bank would pursue acquisitions
and federally assisted takeovers, primarily in Massachusetts
and Connecticut.
   The new mission couldn't be more different from the
contraction he oversaw at the Bank of New England before it
failed in January 1991. "At the Bank of New England, we had
single troubled credits that were larger than all of the bad
loans at Citizen's," said Mr. Fish, 47 years old, who joined
Bank of New England after top management was forced out by
regulators because of the bank's huge losses. "We have an
opportunity here to grow rather than shrink, make money,
hire, and build." Citizen's has assets of $4 billion.
   Mr. Fish will be nominated to the board of the Royal Bank
in December, when Mr. Graboys's term expires.
