Credit Ratings
DURACELL Inc. (Bethel, Conn.) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it upgraded the rating of this consumer battery
maker's guaranteed commercial paper to Prime-3 from Not
Prime. The upgrade affects up to $1.1 billion in guaranteed
commercial paper. Moody's said the upgrade is based on the
unconditional guarantee of Duracell Inc.'s holding company,
Duracell International Inc., as well as Duracell
International's improved capital structure and reduced debt.
It added that Duracell International's cash flow, which
should adequately cover internal investment requirements, has
been enhanced by operating improvements and reduced interest
expense.
