Arizona Senate Panel
   Votes to Approve Bill
   Aimed at Merger Bid
A similar bill was approved by a committee of the
Washington state House of Representatives Feb. 7.
   BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, has announced plans
to divest itself of $2.2 billion in deposits in Arizona,
after which it says it will hold 25% of the state's deposits
in federally insured institutions, a group that includes
thrifts and credit unions in addition to commercial banks.
Sen. Manuel Pena, who sponsored the bill, said BankAmerica's
share of state-chartered bank deposits would be far in excess
of 30%, divestitures notwithstanding.
