Calpers' Proxy Plans Spur Share Prices, Study Finds
In the six months before Calpers announced its proxy
plans, the companies' stocks underperformed the general
market, as measured by the Standard  Poor's 500-stock index,
the study said.
   Applying the improved performance of the 27 stocks to
Calpers' average holdings in its $20 billion stock portfolio,
the study estimated that the "excess returns" from its proxy
activity produced gains for the fund of $137 million a year
since 1988, when Calpers began introducing proxy resolutions.
   "We have long felt, on an intuitive basis, that our
corporate governance activity is beneficial to our investment
returns," Dale M. Hanson, Calpers' chief executive officer
said in a statement. The study's findings "bear this out."
   The study by Wilshire Associates, Calpers' main consultant
on investing activities, didn't rule out other causes for the
stock-price moves. But it said that the "poor performance"
shown by the targeted companies before Calpers' shareholder
resolutions was statistically significant.
