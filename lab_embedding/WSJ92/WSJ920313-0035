Hilton Ex-Dealers' Award
   For Damages Is Reversed
The workers were fired in 1983 after the casino
experienced a sharp drop in the win level at its blackjack
pit, and other methods to remedy the decline had failed. The
dealers, all male and with an average age of 46, asserted
that they were replaced by younger female workers whose
average age was about 31. None of the fired dealers were
charged with any wrongdoing.
   The appeals court found that the lower court erred in
sending the case along to a jury under the state's doctrine
of at-will employment. Historically, Nevada operators have
maintained they can hire and fire employees at will, as the
workers trade job security for relatively high wages.
   John C. McCarthy, lead counsel for the fired workers,
called the reversal a distortion of Nevada law, and noted
that four of the plaintiffs have died since the case was
filed. The workers will consider seeking a rehearing before
the entire court panel, he said.
