Business Brief -- Communications Satellite Corp.:
   Satellite Concern Reports
   Profit for Fourth Quarter
Revenue jumped 21% to $141.3 million from $116.8 million,
partly because Comsat didn't take year-end tariff reductions.
The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates much
of Comsat's business, allowed the company to count a portion
of the accounting charge as part of the costs for its
regulated operations. Comsat therefore didn't have to cut
prices to be within the authorized rate of return.
