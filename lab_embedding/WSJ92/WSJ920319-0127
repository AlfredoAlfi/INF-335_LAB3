Textron Shelf Filing
   Covers $350 Million
   Of Debt Securities
The company said the securities may be issued from time to
time in one or more series, and will be offered on terms
determined at the time of the sale. The company added that
they may be sold directly by Textron or through underwriters,
dealers or agents designated by Textron.
   Textron, a maker of aerospace and commercial products and
provider of financial services, said it expects net proceeds
from the sale of the securities to be used to refinance
certain outstanding debt, including debt incurred in
connection with Textron's recent acquisition of Cessna
Aircraft Co. Proceeds will also be used for general corporate
purposes.
