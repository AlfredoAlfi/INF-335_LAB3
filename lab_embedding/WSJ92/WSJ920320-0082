Business Brief -- Aiwa Co.:
   Japan Firm Cuts Estimate
   For Its Fiscal-Year Earnings
Group revenue is projected at 170 billion yen, up 9.8%
from 154.79 billion yen and only slightly lower than the
earlier forecast of 171 billion yen.
   For the parent company alone, Aiwa didn't alter its
estimate for pretax profit to rise 4% to 4 billion yen from
3.85 billion yen. But, expecting increased tax payments, the
net profit forecast was cut to 1.8 billion yen, down 14% from
2.11 billion yen the year before and 16% from the prior
forecast of 2.15 billion yen. Parent revenue is seen at 150
billion yen, up 8.5% from 138.3 billion yen the year before
but down 2% from 153 billion yen forecast before.
