Business Brief -- Tambrands Inc.:
   Canada Plant Being Closed,
   Another to Be Converted
Tambrands said it will shut its Barrie, Ontario, plant and
consolidate its U.S. and Canadian manufacturing in three
existing plants in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. It said
it will offer "many" of the Palmer employees the chance to
transfer to the other facilities.
   Diana Temple, analyst at Salomon Brothers, said that with
freer trade with Canada, it "makes sense to manufacture from
larger facilities in the U.S."
