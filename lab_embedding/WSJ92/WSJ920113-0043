Business Brief -- Employee Benefit Plans Inc.:
   Management Firm's Stock
   Surrenders Half Its Value
In a terse release late Thursday, the Minneapolis
health-care management concern said it expects to report net
income of about $2.8 million, or 34 cents a share, for the
fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30. That projection falls
significantly short of the 45 to 48 cents a share analysts
had been expecting, and which the company said less than a
month ago it was "comfortable" with.
   EBP provides small employers with benefit-plan design,
administration, claims processing, reinsurance and other
group-health services. The company, which went public in
1989, has enjoyed rapid growth as employers increasingly
turned to self-insurance.
   In recent weeks, the shares had enjoyed a powerful upward
surge. They were trading at approximately $36 a month ago.
