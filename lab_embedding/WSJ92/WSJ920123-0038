Scott's Hospitality Hotel Pact
Scott's formerly was a franchisee of Holiday Inn
Worldwide, a unit of Bass PLC. The companies ended their
agreement last month after Scott's sought to become the
master franchisee, which would have given the company control
of the Holiday Inn brand, including development, in the U.K.
   Scott's, based in Toronto, also has interests in food
services and school bus transportation.
