Marketing  Media:
   Hasbro Unit Is Targeted
   For Boycott Over Toy Line
Parents and teachers in Loveland, a suburb of Cincinnati,
where Kenner is based, protested the line. After national
publicity apparently brought in a blitz of complaints, Kenner
agreed this month to rename a "select group" of the
characters. The company, however, declined to say which
figures would be renamed or when.
   The group, called Citizens Against Mind Polluters, said it
will urge a nationwide boycott of all Kenner products until
the company agrees to discontinue the line. "Toy companies
have been testing the limits of parents for quite some time
now," said Carolyn Zahner, a spokeswoman. "CAMP believes
Kenner has gone beyond the edge. To my knowledge, no other
toy company has been as blatant in its disregard for the
needs of children."
   A spokesman for Kenner declined to comment on the boycott
call.
