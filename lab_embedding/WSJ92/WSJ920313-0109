Business Brief -- Coca-Cola Co.:
   Australia Unit Has Approval
   To Purchase Czech Plant
Coca-Cola Amatil will buy the Kyje soft-drinks facility,
which was previously managed by the state-owned Prague
Confectionery and Soda Works, from the government.
   Dean Wills, chairman and managing director of Coca-Cola
Amatil, said the company will invest in a substantial upgrade
of the Kyje plant to bring it "up to the high standards
expected by the Coca-Cola company." A company spokesman said
that Coca-Cola Amatil has agreed to invest US$82 million in
the plant, including the acquisition price.
   Mr. Wills said the Kyje plant will be incorporated into
Coca-Cola Amatil's wholly owned Czech subsidiary CCA Praha,
which has been operating a distribution and sales business
since September.
   Coca-Cola Amatil has recently been expanding its Eastern
European operations, which it began by taking over franchises
in Austria in the late 1980s.
