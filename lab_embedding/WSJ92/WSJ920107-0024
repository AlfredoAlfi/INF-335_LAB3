Money Manager Wymer
   Denies Charges of Fraud
Mark Roberts, an attorney for Mr. Wymer, said: "It should
be emphasized that despite a massive SEC investigation, a
criminal grand jury investigation, and a thorough examination
by the receiver's attorneys and auditing consultants, there
are no charges of theft or personal misappropriation of any
kind by Mr. Wymer." Mr. Roberts said he plans to ask Judge
Richard Gadbois to set a bail for Mr. Wymer and to unfreeze
his personal assets so that he can post a bond.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said federal
investigators are still trying to determine where the $100
million went. Magistrate Judge Venetta S. Tassopulos
previously denied bail for Mr. Wymer because she said he
hadn't provided documents showing what happened to his
clients' missing money. Mr. Wymer's criminal case was
assigned to Judge Gadbois.
