THE 1993 BUDGET: Bush's Antidote to Recession
   ---
   SEC Would Get 11% Rise
   For Its Fiscal '93 Budget
In briefings on the budget, the administration also made
clear that the SEC soon will propose rules to ease small
businesses' access to capital. Specifically, it would reduce
paperwork the small businesses face in raising money in
securities markets.
   The administration also proposed a 12% budget boost for
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to $52.8 million.
That budget would be covered by a new tax on commodities
trades of 15 cents for each purchase and subsequent sale of a
futures contract; the administration estimates the levy would
raise $55 million in fiscal 1993. Commodities exchanges,
which yield much lobbying clout in Congress, are sure to
fight hard against the fees.
