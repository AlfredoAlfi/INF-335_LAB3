Rates Jump on 30-Year,
   Fixed-Rate Mortgages
"It's enough to put the fear of God in a lot of people who
are sitting on the fence" waiting for rates to bottom out,
said Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH.
   Many lenders report that activity had increased sharply
after last week's 0.2% increase.
   Robert Van Order, chief economist for the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., attributed the increase to rising rates
in the long-term government-bond market.
   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose Thursday to 7.22%
from 7.09%, suggesting that mortgage rates may continue to
drift up, said Mr. Van Order.
   Average rates on one-year, adjustable-rate mortgages were
5.85%, unchanged from last week, HSH said.
