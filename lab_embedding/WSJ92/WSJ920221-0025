Northrop, Sumitomo Talk
   Of Transportation Project
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, in
throwing out the $121 million Sumitomo contract, had also
voted to explore creating a county-owned rail-car plant as a
way to offset aerospace industry job losses in Southern
California.
   Sumitomo has since filed a claim for compensation,
asserting that the county breached its contract for 41 cars
for the Green Line route. A Sumitomo spokesman said the
company's talks with Northrop related to "the broader scope
of transportation," and not specifically to the Los Angeles
project.
   A Northrop spokesman said the talks with Sumitomo are part
of a Northrop effort to study civilian transport projects as
"an area that has potential application for our technology."
   Northrop, whose business largely involves such military
programs as the B-2 Stealth bomber and various missile
systems, has been laying off workers to reflect
defense-budget cutbacks. Among its busiest programs is one
producing fuselage sections for Boeing Co.'s 747 jumbo jets.
