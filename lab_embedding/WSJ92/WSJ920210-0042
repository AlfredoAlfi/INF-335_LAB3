   NATIONAL SANITARY SUPPLY Co. named Robert B. Garber vice
chairman of the board. Mr. Garber was formerly president and
chief operating officer. Paul C. Voet succeeds Mr. Garber as
president. Mr. Voet retains his title as chief executive, but
relinquishes his title as vice chairman of the company. The
position of vice chairman of the company won't be filled.
Additionally, Mr. Voet takes on some duties of the chief
operating officer position, but not the title. That position
won't be filled, either. Friday's edition described the
appointments and succession incorrectly.
