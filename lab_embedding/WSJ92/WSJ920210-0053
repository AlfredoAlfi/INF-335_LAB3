International:
   Cosmonaut Has Return Date
   After Being Stuck in Space
What's a spaceman to do?
   After months of being stranded in space, Mr. Krikalev at
least has a firm return date. Deputy flight director Viktor
Blagov told the Associated Press that Mr. Krikalev, along
with fellow cosmonaut Alexander Volkov, who joined him later,
would return March 23.
   That would bring his total time in space to 311 days,
about two months short of the 366-day world record.
   Mr. Krikalev's plight was reported last week in The Wall
Street Journal.
   He and fellow cosmonaut Anatoly Artsebarsky took off May
18 from the Soviet Union's sprawling Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan. They were scheduled to return Aug. 30. But 12
days before they were to land came the August coup that set
in motion the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
   Mr. Krikalev may be relieved to get back on solid ground,
but it's a whole new world he's coming home to. His hometown
of Leningrad is now called St. Petersburg, and his official
monthly salary of 500 rubles is now worth only about $9.60 at
the widely used unofficial exchange rate.
