Canadian Turbo Inc.
   Agrees to Be Bought
   By Pay Less Holdings
Last week, Turbo said that as a result of record losses it
would explore a variety of strategic transactions. Like other
crudeoil refining and marketing concerns in Canada, Turbo was
hit hard by a record 8% decline in demand for gasoline and
other refined products in 1991.
   Pay Less Holdings is owned by a group of western Canadian
businessmen and several institutional investors, including
Penfund Partners of Toronto. It owns a chain of retail
gasoline, propane and convenience-store outlets in British
Columbia.
   Frank King, Turbo president, said the move "should permit
both Turbo and Pay Less to be more competitive in this
difficult business environment."
   Analysts warn the future could still be tough even for a
large independent because of a shakeout in Canada's oil
businesses. Petro-Canada plans to idle or convert two
refineries, and Imperial Oil, 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., is
expected to take similar steps soon. Analysts said tighter
refining capacity could make it harder for independent
retailers to get gasoline cheaply enough to protect market
share.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Turbo
closed at C$3.30 a share, up 65 Canadian cents.
