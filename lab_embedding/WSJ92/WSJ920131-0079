Lloyd's Expects to Report
   Profit for 1990-91 Period
Chatset's bleak forecast elicited an unusual statement
from Lloyd's Chairman David Coleridge. He conceded that
Lloyd's expects to show an underwriting loss of #390.5
million for 1990. However, he said that for 1991 Lloyd's
expects to show an underwriting profit of #424.5 million.
Those predictions, Mr. Coleridge said, are based on forecasts
submitted by managing agents comprising about 40% of Lloyd's
market capacity over the two years.
   Chatset's figures, Mr. Coleridge said, "especially for the
1991 year, were unnecessarily pessimistic and alarmist and
only served to unsettle members of Lloyd's at what is a
difficult time for all of them," he said.
