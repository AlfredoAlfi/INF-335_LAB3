Business Brief -- Standard Federal Bank:
   Firm Agrees to Acquisition
   Of Thrift for $46.2 Million
The acquisition is the fourth for Standard Federal in less
than three years, and fifth since it went public in 1987.
Standard Federal officials said the acquisition fits their
strategy of buying small, healthy thrifts near their Michigan
base.
   The impact of the acquisition on earnings will be
"negligible," said Michael Maher, Standard Federal
controller. Standard Federal officials said they expect the
acquisition to add about $1.6 million, or five cents a share,
in annual earnings to Standard Federal's bottom line.
   Some consolidation of the thrifts' overlapping operations
will occur, Mr. Maher said. But no final decisions have yet
been made, he added.
   Standard Federal operates 120 branches in Michigan,
Indiana and Ohio, and has assets of $9.5 billion. First
Federal operates seven offices in southeast Michigan and has
assets of $239.9 million.
