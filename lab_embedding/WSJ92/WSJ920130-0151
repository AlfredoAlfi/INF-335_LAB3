Baxter International
   Bone Marrow Therapy
   Will Be Tested Soon
About 11,000 bone marrow transplants occur in the U.S.
each year, often requiring that cancer patients undergo
intensive radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Since such
treatment frequently destroys a patient's bone marrow, marrow
is extracted before the procedures and later reinjected.
   The new research would use monoclonal antibodies to
isolate so-called stem and progenitor cells in a patient's
marrow, so that less marrow would be extracted. The stem and
progenitor cells make up about one percent of the cells in
the marrow, and are the building blocks of a patient's immune
system.
   Baxter said it hopes the antibody-based technology will
allow certain cancer patients to receive safely more
intensive radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
   Johns Hopkins had licensed this technology to Becton
Dickinson  Co., which in turn licensed it to Baxter in 1990.
