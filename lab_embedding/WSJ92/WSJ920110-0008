Who's News:
   Prodigy Chief Plans
   To Leave IBM, Sears
   Information Network
Mr. Papes guided Prodigy, a joint venture of International
Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck  Co., from its
inception in February 1984 to its total of 1.4 million
enrolled members in 1991.
   Along the way, Prodigy became a visible lightning-rod for
a fractious and still unresolved debate over free speech on
personal-computer networks. Prodigy has been repeatedly
criticized for pre-screening and deleting electronic postings
it deemed inappropriate for a family service. Last year it
also drew fire for defending the right to post anti-Semitic
hate messages.
   Before Prodigy, Mr. Papes was a vice president of IBM. He
also was president of its systems products division and
director general of IBM Europe. Mr. Papes said in an
interview that retirement was his own decision.
   Mr. Glatzer joined Prodigy in 1986 as vice president,
marketing. Before his appointment as executive vice
president, he headed the company's consumer marketing, and
later, commercial marketing. He held a number of senior
marketing positions during 18 years at Sears, including
national group marketing manager of automotive/leisure
products.
