Business Brief -- American Medical Holdings Inc.:
   Epic Will Pay $130 Million
   To Buy Its Preferred Shares
Epic was created by an American Medical-sponsored employee
stock ownership plan in 1988. The companies own acutecare
hospitals.
   As with previous sales of its stakes in Epic, American
Medical will use a substantial portion of the proceeds to
retire debt from its leveraged buy-out in 1988.
   The sale is contingent on Epic's ability to find
financing, obtain governmental approvals and amend certain
debt instruments, Epic said. American Medical Holdings said
it expects the sale to close before April 30.
