TWA Says It Plans Hub
   For U.S. Flights at JFK
TWA said the additional flights to Washington and Boston
combined with existing TWA flights will add up to practically
a shuttle service to those cities.
   TWA said it will offer a total of 13 flights a day from
JFK to Washington and 11 flights daily to Boston.
   Additional JFK flights will offer round-trip same-day
service to Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans and Pittsburgh.
   The airline has also expanded its JFK service with three
flights daily to Albany, N.Y., and Providence, R.I.
