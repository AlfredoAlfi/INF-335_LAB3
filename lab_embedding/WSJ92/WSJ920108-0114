German Industrial Output Rises
The November rise was triggered by a 1.5% increase in
manufacturing output, the Economics Ministry said. Economics
Minister Juergen Moellemann said activity in the production
sector of the economy continues to be "robust."
   The November data show a production increase higher than
most economists had expected.
