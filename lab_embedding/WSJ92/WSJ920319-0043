Technology Brief -- Maxtor Corp.:
   Rights to Disk-Drive Lines
   Are Bought by Sequel Inc.
Sequel will pay royalties based on future sales and
services it performs on the disks and will employ several
hundred workers producing the disks.
   Maxtor said Sequel will also become exclusive contractor
for its XT-8000 and Panther disk-drive series, with rights to
buy the disk lines in the future.
   The transaction, which is expected to close next
Wednesday, will have a small pretax impact on Maxtor's
quarterly results, the company said.
