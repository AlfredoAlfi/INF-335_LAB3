Business Brief -- Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc.:
   Despite 13% Gain in Sales,
   Firm Posts Quarterly Loss
The Joppa, Md., company said it restructured its excess
and slow-moving inventory at year end by significantly
marking it down. The markdown decreased net income for the
quarter by $10.5 million, or 20 cents a share.
   "While we recognize that the inventory write-down
negatively impacted our results in the short term, our
financial position remains strong, and we are optimistic in
our outlook for fiscal 1993, including plans to open
approximately 90 new stores and expand 100 stores," said
Michael D. Sullivan, president and chief executive officer.
