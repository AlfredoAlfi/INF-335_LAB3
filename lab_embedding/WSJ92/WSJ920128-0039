International Brief -- Total S.A.:

   41% Rise in '91 Net Income
Total said per-share earnings in 1991 are estimated at 110
francs a share, up 24% from 89 francs in 1990. This accounts
for a 15% rise in Total's shares outstanding over the same
period.
   Total didn't give an estimate for consolidated revenue.
Revenue totaled 128 billion francs in 1990.
   The company said that the earnings improvement reflects a
"high level of activity and productivity gains." Production
of hydrocarbons rose more than 10%, while stocks outside the
Middle East were up by more than 15%.
   It said margins had a temporary lift during the first
quarter of 1991 in response to market conditions during the
Persian Gulf War. However, this was offset by a reduction in
the value of petroleum stocks at year end, reflecting lower
oil and natural gas prices and the dollar's weakness.
   Profits were depressed in the U.S., but elsewhere,
especially in Africa, there were "significant improvements,"
Total said.
