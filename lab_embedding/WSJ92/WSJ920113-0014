   Court Releases Parretti,
   Pathe Holder, From Jail
Last month, Mr. Parretti lost his battle to regain control
of MGM-Pathe Communications, based in Culver City, Calif. A
Delaware court upheld the right of the French state-owned
bank, Credit Lyonnais S.A., to remove Mr. Parretti and two
associates as directors of the movie studio; the bank helped
Mr. Parretti acquire the studio through loans in November
1990.
   Mr. Parretti is the principal shareholder of Pathe
Communications Corp., Los Angeles, which holds 98.5% of
MGMPathe's stock. Since Dec. 1, Mr. Parretti and Pathe have
been in violation of an agreement to pay down a percentage of
their debt to the French bank. Credit Lyonnais hasn't taken
any action to seize Mr. Parretti's MGM-Pathe shares, said a
spokesman for the financier.
