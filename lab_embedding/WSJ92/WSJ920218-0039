Manville Considers
   Adding New Machine
   To Expand Capacity
Plans for new paper-making machines are significant events
in the paper-products industry because the large investments
add considerable amounts of capacity that demand generally
doesn't soak up until many months after they come on line.
The new capacity can soften paper prices for the entire
industry.
   But Manville executive Mr. Stephens said the Denver-based
company's research indicates that the output of
one-and-a-half new paper machines will be needed to supply
demand for high-quality paperboard for food and beverage
containers by 1995. Growth in demand is strong in Europe and
Japan as well as in the U.S., he said. Manville is currently
operating its coated paperboard machines at capacity. "We
need that growth so our salesmen have something to sell," he
explained.
   Mr. Stephens said Manville hopes to finance the expansion
with equity, either in the parent or the Riverwood unit, or
through a venture with another company.
