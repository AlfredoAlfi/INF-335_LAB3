Philadelphia's Mayor
   Offers 5-Year Plan
   To Cut City's Costs
Proposals in the five-year plan include: a "productivity
bank" that will give loans to city departments to streamline
their operations, with the loan to be paid back through
savings over a five-year period; cutting city-employee
benefits; eliminating free legal aid; cutting the number of
paid holidays to 9 days a year from 14 and halving sick days
to 10 from 20.
   Mayor Rendell also proposed that all appointed city
managers, including the mayor, himself, take a 5% pay cut.
   The five-year financial plan is required by the
Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority, an
agency set up by the state's legislature to borrow money on
the city's behalf. Philadelphia's fiscal performance has
"shut us out of the credit market," said Mayor Rendell.
   The five-year plan is first subject to City Council
approval and then will be submitted to the borrowing
authority. The city's annual budget is about $2.3 billion.
