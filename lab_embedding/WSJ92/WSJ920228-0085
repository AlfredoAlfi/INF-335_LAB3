   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The pretax profit was near the lower end of market
expectations, which ranged between #830 million and #900
million.
   Sir Denys Henderson, the company's chairman, said there is
"little doubt" the coming months will remain difficult in
world economies and that any recovery is likely to be
gradual.
   For the fourth quarter, ICI said cost-cutting measures
helped boost performance in most of its businesses.
Pharmaceuticals were strong, while industrial chemicals and
regional businesses were weak.
   Fourth-quarter revenue slipped to #3.05 billion from #3.09
billion in the year-earlier period, but pretax profit rose to
#140 million from a dismal #43 million.
