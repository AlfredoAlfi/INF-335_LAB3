Business Brief -- Cablevision Systems Corp.:
   Chairman Settles Lawsuit
   By Investors in Partnership
The suit, first dismissed on the ground that the investors
in the venture, Cablevision Programming Investments, had
given Mr. Dolan wide latitude in deciding on cash
distributions, was appealed in Illinois court.
   Mr. Dolan declined to comment, but a spokesman for
Cablevision, Woodbury, N.Y., said that the suit never went to
trial and that, "These allegations were never tried or
proved, and Mr. Dolan has always denied and continues to deny
these allegations."
