Keating Pleads Innocent
   In Bankruptcy-Fraud Case
Mr. Keating and Mr. Ligget, the company's former chief
financial officer, pleaded innocent yesterday. Ms. Wischer,
the former president, pleaded innocent on Tuesday, said a
spokesman in the U.S. Attorney's office in Phoenix.
   The five-count indictment added bankruptcy fraud to a long
list of federal crimes against the three individuals. The
core of the government's case has been brought in Los
Angeles, where the same defendants, and two other former
associates, were indicted by a federal grand jury last month
on charges of fraud and racketeering related to the collapse
of the company's former Lincoln Savings  Loan Association
unit.
   All five of the defendants pleaded innocent to the charges
in that case.
