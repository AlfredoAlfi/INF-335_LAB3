Business Brief -- Anchor Bancorp Inc.:
   Quarterly Profit Rises 44%;
   Outlays, Rate Margins Cited
As a result of the performance, Anchor, based in Hewlett,
N.Y., said it was in compliance on Dec. 31 for the second
consecutive quarter with the minimum levels of regulatory
capital currently mandated by the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. But Anchor said it
could temporarily fall out of compliance over the
"short-term," as the act required the amount of Anchor's good
will allowed in calculating the leverage capital ratio to be
reduced about $40 million Jan. 1, with the remainder being
eliminated by 1994.
