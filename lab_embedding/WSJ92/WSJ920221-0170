Rep. Aspin Is Seeking
   To Cut $110 Billion
   Of Defense Outlays
The thrust of Rep. Aspin's initiative is in line with
earlier proposals floated by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell of Maine and Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee, though they don't go as far
to reduce Pentagon spending as many other lawmakers prefer.
   Rep. Aspin has claimed that unlike most of the other
proposals, his package of personnel and hardware cutbacks is
shaped primarily by analyses of post-Cold War international
military threats, rather than domestic budget pressures.
   Some elements of Rep. Aspin's package may be changed in
the next few days, and the overall numbers may be adjusted as
various House Democratic leaders weigh in on the debate. How
quickly the services should shrink in the next two years,
when defense contractors are expected to announce heavy
layoffs, is likely to be a major point of contention.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.),
for example, has held off announcing his position on how deep
Pentagon cutbacks should be until Rep. Aspin finishes his
effort to draft a package acceptable to a majority of the
Armed Services panel.
