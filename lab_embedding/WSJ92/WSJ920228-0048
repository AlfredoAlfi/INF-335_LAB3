Business Brief -- Anago Inc.:
   Appeal Planned of Ruling
   Allowing Acquisition Effort
Both companies are medical-supplies manufacturers based in
Fort Worth, Texas. Tecnol reported $55 million in sales in
1991, and Anago said it expects its revenue this year to top
$22 million.
   Tecnol won a ruling Wednesday from U.S. District Judge
Barefoot Sanders in Dallas in a suit filed by Anago in an
effort to block further stock acquisitions. Judge Sanders
said Tecnol hadn't made a tender offer for Anago shares and
said Tecnol's proposed merger of the company didn't appear to
violate federal antitrust statutes.
