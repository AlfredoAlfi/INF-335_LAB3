Whirlpool Completes Deal
Sagad, an appliance concern with annual sales of about $70
million, gives Whirlpool a "strong position" in Argentina and
continues its "strategic global expansion," the company said.
   Whirlpool's transactions with Philips began in 1989, when
it bought a 53% stake in the company's European appliance
business for $361 million. Last July, Whirlpool paid $600
million for the remaining stake.
