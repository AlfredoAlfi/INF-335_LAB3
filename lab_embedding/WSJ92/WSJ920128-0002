Viral Response Agres
   To Settle FTC Charge
   On Treatment Device
In a February 1990, complaint, the FTC charged that the
company couldn't substantiate claims made in print
advertisements that the treatment-a hand-held device that
blows heated air and medicated spray into nasal or oral
passages-destroys cold viruses, eliminates cold symptoms in a
day or less, prevents the spread of colds and helps provide
long-term relief from allergy symptoms. The complaint also
alleged that the company falsely represented that scientific
tests had established the Viralizer's efficacy.
   The company has consistently maintained that it didn't
make any unsubstantiated claims and that the product's value
is supported by consumers and by independent clinical
studies.
   A statement issued by Viral Response said, "Viralizer and
ViraSpray claims for the relief of the symptoms of colds,
allergies, sinusitis and sore throat have been reviewed and
approved in writing by officials of the Food and Drug
Administration as recently as May 8, 1989." It added that the
company "has frequently expressed the belief that its
regulatory problems have been major competitor-driven,
reflected by a total absence of consumer complaints. . . ."
