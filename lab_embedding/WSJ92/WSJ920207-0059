Campeau Creditor
   Seeks Liquidation,
   Not Restructuring
Campeau's restructuring plan involves exchanging debt and
existing equity for new shares in the company, which will be
renamed Camdev Corp. Mondev, a Montreal real-estate
development concern, opposes the plan, which it claims favors
the biggest Campeau creditors, especially Olympia  York
Developments Ltd., a closely held holding company of
Toronto's Reichmann family. An Olympia  York spokesman
declined to comment on the matter, saying it involved Mondev
and Campeau.
   Mondev's petition to the Supreme Court follows two failed
attempts in Ontario courts to remove Olympia  York from a
category of Campeau unsecured creditors. This would leave
Mondev as the dominant creditor in the class, giving it
effective veto power over the restructuring plan. The plan
already has been approved by Campeau's shareholders and
creditors voting separately by class.
