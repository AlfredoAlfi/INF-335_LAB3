   FCC Votes to Allow
   Broader Competition
   In Satellite Industry
The agency voted 5-0 to permit so-called separate
satellite systems such as Pan American Satellite, Greenwich,
Conn., to offer private telephone line services connected to
public phone networks. The separate systems can also provide
private-line, video and audio transmission services that
aren't connected to public phone networks.
   In addition, the FCC will allow Intelsat's competitors to
provide emergency services to restore communications links
that use public phone networks.
   The policy changes are effective immediately. The agency's
action followed a decision last November by the State and
Commerce departments to end all restrictions on separate
satellite systems by 1997. The decision came in response to a
petition from PanAmSat, a private company that has launched
its own satellite and now serves the U.S., Europe, Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   PanAmSat applauded the agency for dispatching the decision
without a lengthy proceeding. The company "can now implement
a wider range of innovative services to our customers" said
PanAmSat President Fred Landman.
   To prepare for full competition to Intelsat, PanAmSat
announced plans last year to launch three more satellites
beginning in 1994.
