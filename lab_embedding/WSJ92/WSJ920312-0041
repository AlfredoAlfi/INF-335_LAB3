Business Brief -- Revco D.S. Inc.:
   Judge Confirms Firm's Plan
   To Reorganize, Go Public
Stuart Hertzberg, an attorney for Revco's trade creditors,
said half the creditors he represents accepted a cash offer
from Zell/Chilmark Fund L.P. in lieu of stock in the
reorganized drugstore chain. Zell/Chilmark, an investment
group, agreed in January to provide creditors with as much as
$250 million as a cash alternative to common stock.
Zell/Chilmark will control 18% of the publicly traded Revco
as a result of the trade creditors' acceptance of the cash
offer, Mr. Hertzberg said.
