Business Brief -- Siemens AG:
   Siemens-Nixdorf Stock Offer
   Is Made for Rest of Shares
The move follows a tender offer completed Dec. 6 in which
Siemens had sought to acquire the 22% of Siemens-Nixdorf it
hadn't owned prior to then. In that offer, Siemens received
tenders for around 3.8 million Siemens-Nixdorf shares, giving
it just over 95% of the capital stock of its computer and
information systems unit.
   Under German law, Siemens must offer shareholders not
tendering stock in the original bid a settlement based on an
independent assessment of Siemens-Nixdorf's market value.
   The original tender had offered 225 marks a share for
Siemens-Nixdorf stock. Siemens had warned shareholders in the
original offer that if they didn't tender their shares, they
risked receiving a lower price for their Siemens-Nixdorf
stock after the independent audit.
