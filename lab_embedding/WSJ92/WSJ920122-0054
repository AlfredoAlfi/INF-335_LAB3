   MCI's Gabbard to Quit
   Financial Chief's Post
The entrepreneurial Mr. Gabbard joined MCI when the
long-distance telephone company acquired Telecom USA Inc. in
August 1990 for $1.25 billion. Mr. Gabbard declined to
comment on his share of the payment, but analysts figured
that since he owned between 1% and 2% of Telecom at the time
of the acquisition, his share ranged between $10 million and
$20 million.
   Mr. Gabbard said he was leaving MCI "not to take a
full-time position anywhere" but to become involved again in
high technology start-up companies and to be a "mentor" to
other entrepreneurs. "It's hard to get it out of your system
once you've done it," he said. One of those businesses may
interest MCI. "If it does, MCI will be the first place I
call," he said.
