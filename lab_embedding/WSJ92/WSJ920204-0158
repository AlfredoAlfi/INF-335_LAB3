Pepper...and Salt
I'm calm and composed,
   Unruffled and safe,
   I have no occasion
   To panic or chafe,
   In fact, I've no worry
   Of any nature or sort --
   But then, I've never
   Been nominated for the
   Supreme Court.

   As Russians tear their statues down,
   Midst revelry and shouting,
   There's joy in countryside and town --
   The pigeons, though, are pouting.
