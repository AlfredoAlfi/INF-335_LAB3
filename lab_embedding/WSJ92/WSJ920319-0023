   Cotton Method to Monsanto
Agracetus, based in Middleton, Wis., said its goal is to
get products on the market "as quickly as possible" both
through cooperative relationships as well as internal product
development. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, is counting on
bioengineered agricultural products to be among its biggest
sellers by the end of the decade. But market introduction of
the first transgenic cotton product isn't expected for
several years.
