Treasury to Challenge
   Dresser Joint Venture
   With Ingersoll-Rand
Dresser, a diversified engineering and energy concern
based in Dallas, has been in discussions with Ingersoll-Rand
for several months about a combination of their pump
manufacturing and sales operations. The joint venture would
create a company with revenue of under $800 million, a
Dresser spokesman said.
   The Dresser spokesman declined comment on the Justice
Department's action, saying no one at the company has had a
chance to discuss the department's objections. A spokesman at
Ingersoll-Rand, based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., declined to
comment.
