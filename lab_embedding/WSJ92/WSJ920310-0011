International Brief -- Renault S.A.:
   Truck Unit Plans Venture
   With Czechoslovak Concern
The Renault unit, Renault Vehicules Industriels, plans to
acquire an equity interest in Karosa, but a spokesman for the
French company said it's too early to determine how big the
stake might be.
   Karosa will retain its identity, but its research and
industrial operations will be modernized. RVI will help
Karosa improve its existing range of products by supplying
the company with engine and gearbox assemblies. The companies
will pool their marketing and service networks.
