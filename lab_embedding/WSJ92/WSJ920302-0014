International:
   NTT Expects Another Drop
   In Profit Next Fiscal Year
Total revenue during the next fiscal year is expected to
grow 3% to 6.4 trillion yen from a projected 6.2 trillion yen
this year.
   The projections came a day after the Finance Ministry said
it was shelving plans for the sale this year of more shares
in the largely government-owned company. The government is
supposed to reduce its two-thirds stake in NTT, but the weak
Tokyo stock exchange and NTT's slumping share price have
repeatedly forced it to delay such plans. NTT's shares closed
at 712,000 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Friday, down
16,000 yen from Thursday. At its high in 1987, it traded at
3.18 million yen.
   In the fiscal year ended last March 31, NTT posted pretax
profit of 414.3 billion yen on revenue of six trillion yen.
