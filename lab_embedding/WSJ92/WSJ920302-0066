Roberts Seeks to Protect
   Municipal Bond Buyers
Unrated municipal issues in such areas as nursing homes,
industrial development projects and special tax districts
have accounted for about 75% of municipal bond defaults in
recent years, Mr. Robert told a Public Securities Association
conference here. Many of these defaulted bonds were sold to
unsophisticated investors, he said.
   Mr. Roberts, who has staked out a position as the agency's
leading member on municipal bond matters, promised greater
SEC enforcement action in the municipal market, where even
market participants have called for stricter regulation.
   He said the SEC's enforcement efforts in the municipal
area have lagged in the past, but he told reporters the
agency has been investigating several municipal securities
transactions. He indicated he expects enforcement cases to be
brought in the future.
