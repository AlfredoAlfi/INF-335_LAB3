Bally Unit Files Plan
   To Reorganize, Pay
   Some of Its Creditors
   ---
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Under the plan, holders of the unit's $320 million
outstanding of 11 1/2% first mortgage notes would receive all
of the reorganized Bally's Grand common stock and $250
million of new eight-year, 12% first mortgage notes that
would be secured by the two casinos and other assets.
   Holders of the unit's $84.2 million outstanding of 13%
second mortgage notes would receive about $16.8 million
principal amount of the new first mortgage notes. Holders of
Bally's Grand's 12% senior subordinated notes, or the
so-called third mortgage holders with about $12 million in
unsecured debt, would receive nothing. Bally would retain a
management agreement for the casinos, but Mr. Goldberg
declined to disclose the terms.
   Bally and the first mortgage holders apparently are
betting that they can force the plan on the other debtholders
in a so-called cram-down agreement.
   Lawyers for the second-and-third mortgage holders said
they hadn't seen the filing but the plan didn't appear
acceptable to them.
