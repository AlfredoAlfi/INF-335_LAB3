International:
   Shanghai Concern to Issue
   First Stock to Foreigners
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Trading may not begin until March and will be limited to a
small number of government-approved brokers. Separate "A"
shares are being sold to Chinese, who are forbidden to
purchase "B" shares.
   Shanghai Vacuum is the second company to issue stock to
foreigners since the Communist takeover in 1949. In a race to
be the first, it lost out to China Southern Glass Co., which
last month placed 16 million "B" shares in one day, according
to Hoare Govett Asia, the placing agent.
   Both issues were delayed for months by political debate
over the move. Then four foreign underwriters of the Shanghai
Vacuum stock issue rejected the terms and pulled out in
November, causing further delay. The remaining underwriters
are SBCI Finance Asia Ltd., a subsidiary of Swiss Bank Corp.;
Sun Hung Kai  Co. of Hong Kong; and Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Eight other Chinese companies have received government
permission to issue "B" shares.
   Shanghai's stock exchange opened for business in December
1990.
