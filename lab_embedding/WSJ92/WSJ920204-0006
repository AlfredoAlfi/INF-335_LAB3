GM Sets 2-for-1 Split
   Of Its Class E Shares;
   Dividend Is Increased
GM wants to piggy-back on EDS's success to lure new
investor capital into its car business. While Class E shares
don't confer ownership in EDS, they represent a dividend
interest in EDS's performance.
   The Class E dividend is payable March 10 to stock of
record Feb. 13. The stock split is payable March 10 to Class
E shares of record Feb. 14.
   GM held its common stock dividend at 40 cents a share.
Some analysts had speculated that the dividend might be cut
in light of the auto maker's heavy losses. GM's common shares
closed at $34, up $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   With its latest stock offering, GM is looking to
capitalize on the success of EDS. GM's Class E shares climbed
38% to $57.38 yesterday from $41.68 a year ago. GM's common
shares have fallen about 18% from its year-earlier level.
   EDS has posted sizable earnings gains in the last several
quarters. The Dallas-based computer services unit had
third-quarter net income of $145.5 million, or 61 cents a
share, up 13% from $128.4 million a year earlier. Revenue
rose 13% to $1.73 billion from $1.53 billion.
   GM held the quarterly payout on its Class H shares at 18
cents, payable March 10 to stock of record Feb.
