Creditor Committee
   Of First Capital Wins
   A Round in Court
In the past, Shearson officials have said their proposal
provides the greatest value to all of First Capital's
policyholders. Late yesterday, officials of the American
Express Co. unit couldn't be reached. A spokesman for
Citicorp's Citibank unit declined to comment.
   The creditors committee said it hopes to file an
alternative plan shortly that will be more beneficial to all
policyholders and creditors, said Hank Knowlton, committee
co-chairman. The committee includes State Bank of South
Australia, and Mitsui Manufacturers Bank, among others.
   The Shearson Lehman reorganization plans calls for a
syndicate of bankers, owed about $260 million and led by
Citibank, to receive all of the shares outstanding of First
Capital's two life insurance units. The plan would leave no
distribution for holders of First Capital Holdings' 13%
senior subordinated debentures and other creditors. Shearson
Lehman also has agreed to lend $50 million to one of the
units, First Capital Life Insurance Co., to guarantee the
value of its policyholder accounts.
