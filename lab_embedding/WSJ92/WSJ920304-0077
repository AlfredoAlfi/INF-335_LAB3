Buffton Gets New Credit Line
The agreement allowed Buffton to repay its loan to Bank of
Boston, which was due on April 1, and lifted a cloud from the
company. The Bank of Boston loan, which the company had been
paying down with proceeds from asset sales, stood at $8.2
million last month. Buffton said it has spent "a great deal
of management time and energy" over two years to resolve its
"unstable" relationship with Bank of Boston.
