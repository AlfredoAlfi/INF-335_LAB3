Business Brief -- Rohm  Haas Co.:
   Firm Mulls Joining Forces
   With Unit of Elf Aquitaine
The Philadelphia-based specialty chemicals and plastics
concern said the joint venture should be able to compete in
markets around the world, "something neither Elf Atochem nor
we have been able to do on our own." Rohm  Haas said the
benefits include a reduction of manufacturing costs resulting
from the exchange of manufacturing technologies and the
ability to support significant research and development
efforts.
   The company said the joint venture would consist of a
North American company, probably based in Philadephia, that
will be 51%-owned by Rohm  Haas; a European-based company
that will be 51%-owned by Elf Atochem, the chemicals arm of
France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine; and a third jointly
owned company for the rest of the world. Global sales are
expected to be $500 million.
   The companies will seek the necessary government approvals
and implementation is expected by the end of second quarter.
