Business Brief -- AIM Telephones Inc.:
   Bankruptcy Court Protection
   And a Buyer Are Sought
The installer of telephone equipment, hurt by a
deteriorating economy and cut-throat competition in the
office-phone business, filed a Chapter 11 petition with the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey. The company said it
hopes to continue operations and service its customer base in
order to preserve its assets while efforts are being made to
find a purchaser. It said it will maintain a workforce
necessary to support its customers, but won't solicit new
business.
   AIM also has consented to a transfer of its shares to the
over-the-counter market, as it no longer meets American Stock
Exchange listings standards. The Amex told AIM that its last
day of trading will be Jan. 17.
