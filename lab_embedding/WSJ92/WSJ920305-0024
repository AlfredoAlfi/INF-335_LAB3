   Increases in Capital
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Mutual insurance companies are owned by their
policyholders, rather than by shareholders. Total capital
serves as a cushion for policyholders against losses.
   Blue Cross  Blue Shield, which ended 1990 with a deficit
in reserves of $124 million, posted a $3 million positive
balance for reserves at year end. Nonprofit insurers like
Blue Cross affiliates report their change in reserves to
regulators as one measure of their financial results.
   A spokesman for Blue Cross of New Jersey said the increase
was due to lower claims and administrative costs, along with
favorable legislative changes and rate increases.
   Home Life Insurance, New York, which is merging with
Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co., Hartford, Conn., said its
total capital rose $23.6 million to $225.2 million. As a
result, it said its capital-to-asset ratio rose to 5.47% from
4.36%.
