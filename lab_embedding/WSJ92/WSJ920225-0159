Four Holder Lawsuits
   Filed Against Archer
   Communications Inc.
At the root of the litigation is a series of public
statements concerning Archer's business and financial
prospects made by company officials over a period of several
years.
   As reported in a page one story in this newspaper last
December, those statements were often excessively optimistic.
The company also is being investigated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for possible securities-law violations.
   During the past several years, Archer's stock soared to
more than $20 from under $1 a share. Yesterday, in
over-the-counter trading, the stock closed at $2.1875, off
18.75 cents.
   Part of Archer's allure was its success in recruiting some
prominent entertainment-industry names to help promote the
company. For instance, Creative Artists, generally regarded
as Hollywood's most powerful talent agency, agreed to help
market Archer's technology in return for a percentage of
Archer revenue and options on Archer stock.
   In an interview, David Gallagher, Archer's vice president,
finance, said the company never knowingly misled
shareholders. But he acknowledged that the company's business
didn't develop as quickly as hoped and "people are
disappointed."
