Marketing Brief -- Mirror Group Newspapers PLC:
   Guardian Newspaper Group
   Is Putting Together a Bid
Robert Maxwell's empire collapsed after his death last
November amid allegations that he diverted more than $1.2
billion to support the share price of Maxwell Communication
Corp., service debt and cover operating losses.
   Court-appointed administrators for the Maxwells' private
holdings, however, have said the family's 51% holding in
Mirror Group Newspapers was no longer for sale. The
administrators are trying to sell Maxwell assets to repay
debts.
