Enterprise:
   New York Mayor Plans
   To Increase Contracts
   Given to Minorities
Mr. Dinkins's plan, which in effect seeks to set aside a
specified portion of the city's business for minorities and
women, is similar to programs already are in place in cities
such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago and Seattle, he said.
"New York was one of the few major cities that never had a
law specifically to aid minority-and-women-owned business
enterprises," he added.
   Mr. Dinkins said that the study, conducted by National
Economic Research Associates, New York, found that firms
owned by women and minorities comprise some 25% of the city's
business community. But they have received only 7% of a
sampling Mr. Dinkins cited of $2.3 billion in contracts and
purchase orders.
   The city's practices were most discriminatory in
construction, the study said. Black-owned firms, for example,
received only 17 cents of every dollar they would be
"expected to receive based on their availability," Mr.
Dinkins said. Asian-American and other minority firms fared
even worse, getting only 14%, the study said.
   Mr. Dinkins said the city plans by March 30 to come up
with rules of the program, which should "be functioning and
in place before June 30."
