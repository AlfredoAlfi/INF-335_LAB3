Technology Brief -- Apple Computer Co.:
   Laser Printers Are Unveiled
   For IBM-Compatible PCs
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., already makes most of
the printers used by its popular line of Macintosh PCs. But
about 90% of all the nation's personal computers are
IBM-compatibles, which use different operating systems than
Apple computers and often run Microsoft Corp. software. Apple
also introduced a scanner that works with IBM-compatible
machines.
   The new products will place Apple in direct competition
with Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., which currently
dominates the market for printers and scanners that work with
IBM-compatible PCs.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apple stock fell 25
cents a share to close at $63, while Hewlett-Packard stock
was quoted at $83.125 a share, up 62.5 cents, in late New
York Stock Exchange trading.
