York International
   Says Fourth Period
   Held No Surprises
York became a public company again in October with an
initial offering of 10.7 million shares, priced at $23 each,
raising proceeds of $261 million which were used to retire
debt raised in the company's leveraged buy-out in 1988. York,
prior to the buy-out, was a 1986 spinoff of Borg-Warner Corp.
   The two executives were in New York to speak to the
analysts who follow the company, and said they hope more Wall
Street firms begin investment research on York. Mr.
Pokelwaldt noted that one problem in finding more analysts is
that "we're the only single play out there" in the
refrigeration and air-conditioning business. Its main
competitors in the large refrigeration equipment buisness,
Carrier Corp. and Trane Co., are both owned by big parents --
United Technologies Corp. and American Standard Corp.,
respectively.
   York also produces heating and ventilation equipment. For
the residential and small-office market, there are several
American makers and now a slew of Japanese makers of
portables, Mr. Pokelwaldt said.
