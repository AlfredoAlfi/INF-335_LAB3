Avis Proposes Change
   In New York Liability
   Law for Car Owners
"We do not wish to make the drastic move taken by Hertz,"
said Charles A. Bovino, Avis executive vice president.
   The car-rental concern is proposing a limit on vicarious
liability recoveries of $100,000 for each individual and
$300,000 for each accident. It also would confine the law to
accidents that take place in New York state, wouldn't make
vehicle owners responsible for accidents involving gross
misuse of the vehicle and wouldn't cover drivers not
authorized by the rental agreement.
