Business Brief -- Nestle S.A.:
   Company Says Sales Rose
   9% During the Past Year
Nestle attributed the 9% sales growth to the continued
favorable development of sales in all parts of the world with
the exception of the Gulf region, to the slightly positive
evolution of foreign currencies (except those of Latin
America) against the Swiss franc, as well as to the
contribution of several minor acquisitions.
   Despite the world-wide economic slowdown and the drop in
purchasing power in some developing countries, sales growth
excluding acquisitions and disinvestments remained at 4%,
Nestle said.
   Looking ahead, Nestle said it expects the current year to
show continued growth in sales volume, consolidated sales
figures and profit provided that "the economic situation
doesn't deteriorate dramatically, and that the currency
exchange rates don't undergo a fundamental modification
toward the Swiss franc."
   Nestle said it will announce 1991 profit and its dividend
proposal on March 20.
