Letters to the Editor --
   Our New Legal Ideal:
   Blameless Perpetrator
I suppose that this finding by the jury merely confirms
the growing belief that no one is responsible for his or her
own actions. This tendency has proved itself dangerous not
only in the business world, but also in the actions of
criminals who continue to successfully portray themselves as
victims.
