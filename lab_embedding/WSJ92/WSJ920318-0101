Business Brief -- Lawson Mardon Group Ltd.:
   Streamlining Strategy Calls
   For Dismissing 600 Workers
Lawson Mardon took a 14.5 million Canadian dollar (US$12.1
million) charge against 1991 earnings to pay for the costs of
its restructuring and the staff reductions. That move,
together with C$16.8 million in losses and charges on
discontinued operations, turned Lawson Mardon's profit
continuing operations of C$20.5 million into a net loss of
C$10.8 million, or 38 Canadian cents a share, vs. 1990 net
income of C$25.5 million, or 89 Canadian cents a share.
   Lawrence Tapp, president and chief executive officer, said
the restructuring should let the company cut costs and
increase profits in 1992.
