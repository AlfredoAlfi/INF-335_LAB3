U.S. Pension Agency
   Takes Over CFI Plan
CFI agreed to terminate the plan and to have the PBGC
become trustee, the agency said. The steelmaker hasn't made
contributions to the plan since July 1990, and the plan's
liabilities are only about 10% funded, the PBGC said.
   Although CFI had made all legally required pension
contributions through July 1990, the plan was still grossly
underfunded, the agency said. The case points out the "urgent
need" for immediate legislative changes to improve pension
funding, Mr. Lockhart said, reiterating the PBGC's view. The
Bush administration has pledged to push for enactment of such
legislation.
   CFI made its bankruptcy-law filing on Nov. 7, 1990,
shortly before the PBGC would have been able to obtain liens
against the company for missing required pension payments,
the agency said.
