MCI, Todd Corp.
   Acquire 24.5% Stakes
   In Australian Concern
Australia is deregulating its telecommunications industry,
a move that is attracting international companies to compete
for business against the government-owned carrier Australian
 Overseas Telecommunications Corp.
   AAP Communications said when announcing its new
shareholders Friday that it is targeting the business
communications market. The company plans to introduce this
year a virtual private network service modelled on MCI's Vnet
service in the U.S.
   Financial details of the investments weren't disclosed.
   Todd is a closely held New Zealand forestry, natural
resources, communications and property company.
   Todd and MCI also are shareholders in Clear
Communications, a New Zealand communications carrier.
