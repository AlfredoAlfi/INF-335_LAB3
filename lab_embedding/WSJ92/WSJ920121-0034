   British Aerospace's
   Finance Chief Resigns

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The spokeswoman also confirmed newspaper reports that the
troubled defense contractor faced a claim from U.K.
supermarket chain Asda Group PLC for the reduced value of
property owned by a joint venture between the two companies.
However, she said she couldn't confirm speculation that the
claim was for #80 million ($143.6 million).
   The company said there is "no connection" between the
position of Mr. Eustace, "in whom the board has full
confidence," and the real estate problems. Mr. Eustace
declined to comment beyond the company's statement.
   British Aerospace's liability to Asda arose from Burwood
House Group, an equally owned joint venture between Asda and
Arlington Development Property, a British Aerospace
subsidiary. When the #450 million joint-venture agreement was
signed in December 1989, Arlington promised to pay Asda if
property values fell below a certain level. The U.K. real
estate market promptly went into a tailspin.
   An Asda spokesman also refused to comment on the #80
million figure. "I can confirm we had an agreement with
British Aerospace, and we're in delicate discussions with
them over it," he said.
