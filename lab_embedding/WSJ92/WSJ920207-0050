Marketing  Media Brief -- Pulitzer Publishing Co.:
   Media Concern's Earnings
   For Fourth Quarter Slipped
A $3.9 million charge to write down good will and other
intangibles at the company's Lerner Newspapers unit trimmed
per-share earnings by 35 cents in the latest quarter; that
was largely offset by a tax-reserve adjustment, from a
favorable tax ruling, which effectively added 34 cents a
share in the period.
   The latest quarter also included about $700,000 in
incentive and severance payments related to work force
reductions in the newspaper group, which trimmed pershare
earnings by about two cents. For the year, such payments have
totaled $4.8 million.
   Pulitzer said the company's "emphasis on cost control,
productivity and debt reduction served us well in a year in
which advertising demand continued to be very disappointing."
