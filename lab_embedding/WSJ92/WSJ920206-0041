Business Brief -- Campeau Corp.:
   Concern Is Unable to Keep
   Document From Director
Mr. Kelly argued in his claim that the legal opinion
should be considered by the full board before the
restructuring plan receives final approval. However, an
Ontario Court of Justice judge ruled that the document wasn't
relevant to the restructuring plan, although he ordered that
it be released to Mr. Kelly and other directors on a
confidential basis, Campeau said.
   Campeau's restructuring plan involves exchanging debt and
existing equity in the real estate concern for new shares in
the company, which will be renamed Camdev Corp.
