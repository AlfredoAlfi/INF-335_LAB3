   Upjohn Agrees to Sell
   Sleeping Pill in Canada
   In Smaller Quantities
Other countries have taken more restrictive steps. France
and Spain recently banned temporarily sales of the
highest-strength Halcion sleeping tablet. And medical
authorities in the United Kingdom in October outright banned
Halcion.
   Critics contend that Halcion users have a higher incidence
of adverse reactions, including anxiety, aggressive behavior
and confusion, than users of similar drugs.
   The pharmaceutical concern said it also will voluntarily
fund two programs educating physicians, pharmacists and
insomnia patients about the appropriate use of Halcion.
Upjohn estimates the cost of the two programs at about
$500,000. Similar programs have been ongoing in the U.S. for
sometime, Upjohn Canada officials said.
   "We believe {Canada's} decision confirms the safety and
efficacy of Halcion," said Peter Croden, president and
general manager of Upjohn Canada. "But we believe it is our
responsibility to add to these measures to help promote the
appropriate use of our medication."
