Alleghany's Net Rose
   73% in 4th Quarter
   From Sale of Unit
Despite the increase in net income, continuing operations
in the quarter showed a loss of $7.9 million compared with
profit of $12.6 million the year before.
   Alleghany said the operating loss was due in part to a
$7.1 million provision by its consumer banking unit,
Sacramento Savings Bank, as well as part of a $6 million
charge related to costs incurred through the acquisition of
Ticor Title Insurance Co. An additional $6.9 million
write-down was taken to reflect the lower stock market prices
for Alleghany's holdings in Armco Inc. and Cyclops Industries
Inc.
   A company spokesman said its Chicago Title  Trust Co.
unit benefited from a sharp increase in mortgage refinancing
activity at year end.
   In the year, earnings fell 7% to $64 million, or $10.01 a
share, from $68.6 million, or $10.38 a share, a year ago.
Year-earlier per-share figures are adjusted for a 2% stock
dividend paid in April. Revenue rose 16% to $1.42 billion
from $1.22 billion.
