Business Brief -- Sanyo Electric Co.:
   GE to Make Compressors
   To Ship to Japanese Firm
He said the move is designed to ease a shortage of
compressors in North America resulting from an abrupt rise in
demand for air conditioners in Japan in the past couple of
years. Sanyo has been supplying compressors to North America
from Singapore, but had to shift some shipments to Japan to
meet increased demand. The spokesman added that the accord is
aimed at promoting international cooperation.
   The two companies also have agreed to exchange technical
information on the development of substitutes for
chlorofluorocarbon, which has been used as a refrigerant in
air conditioners and refrigerators.
