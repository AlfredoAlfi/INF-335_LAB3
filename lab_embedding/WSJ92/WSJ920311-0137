Dollar General to Post
   Quarterly Net Above
   Analysts' Projections
For the fiscal year just ended, the company anticipates
reporting earnings of between $21 million and $21.5 million,
or between $1 and $1.02 a share, Mr. Quinnell said. Again,
those numbers should slightly exceed analysts' expectations.
In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 1991, Dollar General earned
$14.6 million, or 73 cents a share on a re-stated basis.
   Sales for the most recent year totaled $754.4 million,
compared with $653.2 million a year ago.
   Looking ahead, the company expects to report per-share
earnings of eight cents to 12 cents for its fiscal first
quarter ended April 30, compared with six cents in the
year-earlier quarter.
   The strong performance in the just-completed quarter and
year, Mr. Quinnell said, reflects lower overhead, as well as
increased sales fueled by higher traffic and price declines.
   Aggressive pricing helped boost traffic by 10% for the
year. Prices dropped 3% to 10% compared with 1% to 5%
declines in previous years, Mr. Quinnell said.
   The company believes the recession will leave a lasting
dent on consumer spending. "There's been a fundamental change
in outlook of the shopping public," Mr. Quinnell said. "In
the past, we'd see brand loyalty and store loyalty. Now that
seems to be dissipating."
