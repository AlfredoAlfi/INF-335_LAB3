Business Brief -- LTV Corp.
   Units Agree on Labor Pact
   Covering Plants in Texas
LTV has proposed selling operations at those plants as
part of its reorganization plan for emergence from
bankruptcy-court protection. A company spokeswoman said the
new labor pact isn't related to the proposed sale of the
units but replaces a contract that expired Sunday.
   LTV said last week that it agreed to sell its aerospace
and missiles divisions to Vought Corp., a company jointly
owned by Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. The sale
must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   The new labor contract calls for general pay increases of
3%, effective next week, and 2% in each of the following
years, plus on-time performance awards of 4% in the first
year and 3% in each of the following years, according to the
union and the LTV units. The UAW also agreed to random
drug-screening of all employees.
