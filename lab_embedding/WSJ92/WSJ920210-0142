International:
   Opposition Candidate
   Is Elected in Japan
   To Parliament Post
The victory by Yukihisa Yoshida also was viewed as
endorsing opposition demands for leading politicians to
testify in Parliament on recent bribery scandals.
   "My victory means the people will no longer tolerate
corrupt politics," said a jubilant Mr. Yoshida, who ran on an
anti-corruption ticket.
   With 64% of the vote counted, Mr. Yoshida was certain to
win. He had 156,595 votes against 115,628 for governing party
candidate Nobuharu Enoki, election officials said.
   Mr. Yoshida was backed by the powerful Rengo labor union
and Socialist and Democratic Socialist parties in the
election in Nara prefecture in western Japan.
   Mr. Miyazawa's popularity has slumped as a result of a
series of bribery scandals, growing tensions with the U.S.,
and the failure of key administration-backed bills in
Parliament.
