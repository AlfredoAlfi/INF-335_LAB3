International:
   Japan Central Bank Head
   Is Threatened Over Rates
Mr. Kanemaru's surprising remarks came after Mr. Mieno on
Wednesday ruled out an immediate cut in the discount rate,
the fee the central bank charges commercial banks. Several
cabinet ministers and businessmen, citing evidence that
Japan's economic expansion has stopped, have called for a cut
in the rate, which now stands at 4.5%, to stimulate the
economy.
   Few took Mr. Kanemaru's threat seriously, but it did cause
dismay among economists because it is unusual for an
influential politician to threaten the central bank governor
with dismissal. The governor is appointed by the prime
minister for a five-year term and can technically be removed
by him, but in theory operates free of political pressure.
   A senior economist at a private-sector research institute
described Mr. Kanemaru's approach as "nonsense" and said it
was designed to buy favor from the public ahead of an
upper-house by-election next month that could throw Prime
Minister Miyazawa's leadership into question.
