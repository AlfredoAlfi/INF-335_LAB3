Hanger Orthopedic
   Expects to Report
   Profit for 4th Quarter
Mr. Manganiello, in an interview, emphasized the growth in
operating profit, to $817,000 for the quarter against a
$19,000 operating loss in the 1990 quarter. Sales should be
27% higher at $6.7 million, compared with $5.3 million a year
earlier.
   For the year, the provider of custom-made orthopedic and
prosthetic devices expects to report a loss of $623,000, or
18 cents a share, including a noncash charge of 21 cents a
share for debt prepayment. Mr. Manganiello said operating
profit more than doubled, to $2.7 million from $1.2 million.
Sales for 1991 were $23.7 million, up 23% from $19.3 million,
and Mr. Manganiello said sales in the fourth quarter were
running at an annualized rate of about $27 million.
   He said Hanger's results will be released later than usual
because its auditors needed to examine the companies it
acquired during the year.
   Mr. Manganiello cited Hanger's strong growth in cash flow,
or earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, to
nearly $4 million for last year, from $2.3 million in 1990.
Cash flow for the quarter rose to $1.4 million from $356,000
the year before.
