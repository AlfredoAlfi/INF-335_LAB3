Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 33.3% involved
stock-index arbitrage, down from 52.2% the previous week. In
this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index
options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 28.6% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 46.2%
involved trading for customers. The remaining 25.2% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, only Nomura Securities did
most of its program trading for its own account, rather than
for customers.
