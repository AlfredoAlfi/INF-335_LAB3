Business Brief -- UtiliCorp United Inc.:
   Earnings in First Quarter
   Are Expected to Be Flat
Revenue is expected to rise 20% to $381 million from $317
million.
   The company said the results weren't unexpected because of
the mild weather throughout most of its service territories
and the pressure of lower natural gas, oil and natural gas
liquids market prices. UtiliCorp also attributed the lower
results expected to the effect of lower gas prices on its
Aquila Energy operations.
