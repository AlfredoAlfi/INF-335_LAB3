Ex-Official Pleads Guilty
   In J. David Fraud Case
Mr. Yarry is the last remaining defendant in the J. David
 Co. investment scandal. About 1,200 investors lost a total
of $80 million with the J. David firm. They had been lured
into investing with promises of 40% to 50% returns on its
international trading currencies. But prosecutors said little
or no trading was actually done, and that the company used
money from new investors to pay dividends to older customers.
   Founder J. David Dominelli is serving a 20-year federal
prison term on fraud and tax evasion convictions. His company
collapsed in 1984. Mr. Yarry faces as much as 10 years in
prison and $260,000 in fines. Mr. Hardy said he would
recommend a five-year prison term, but the final decision is
up to a federal judge at a May 26 sentencing.
