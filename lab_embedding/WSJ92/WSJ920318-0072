Notable  Quotable
Announcer: And now, another Capitol Hill Bank Moment.
   Bank teller: I'm working behind the counter here at the
Bank, when in comes a freshman Congressman. He puts $500 into
his new checking account. Boy, you should have seen the look
on his face when I told him $500 in a Capitol Hill checking
account is unheard of. Congressmen never keep that kind of
money in the bank.
   Congressman: So this kindly teller tells me that my $500
is worth $60,000 to $100,000 in check writing privileges]
Until that moment I never realized how much I was going to
love living in Washington. Heh, heh.
   Announcer: Capitol Hill Bank, for worry-free checking.
