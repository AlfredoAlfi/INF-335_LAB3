Business Brief -- Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken:
   Yearly Operating Profit Fell
   30% Due to Loan Problems
SE Banken's results, which were preliminary, were in line
with the bank's own forecasts and somewhat better than market
expectations.
   Loan-loss provisions have risen steadily over the past
three years to reach 1.51% of the group's loan portfolio at
the end of 1991, compared with 0.63% at year-end 1990 and
0.23% in 1989, it said.
   The bank said it had about 5.5 billion kronor in
unproductive loans at the end of 1991, up from 3.4 billion
kronor a year earlier.
