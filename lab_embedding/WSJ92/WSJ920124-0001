Marriott Corp. Grants
   U.K. Franchise Rights
   To Scott's Hotels Ltd.
Scott's Hotels also owns and operates another hotel not
under the Holiday Inn name and has four more under
development, all of which will be given the Marriott name.
That would bring the number of hotels under the Marriott name
to 18.
   Marriott's decision to go with Scott's Hotels, a division
of Scott's Hospitality Inc. of Toronto, was seen by industry
officials as the quickest route to gaining market share in
one of Europe's largest hotel markets, even if it means
surrendering some control over the Marriott name.
   Marriott currently has 23 hotels outside the U.S.,
including two in the U.K. that aren't part of the deal with
Scott's Hotels. But that number pales next to the nearly 700
hotels owned or operated in the U.S. by Marriott.
   "They now see the international area as the one to
concentrate on for development," said Fritz Ternofsky,
chairman of Scott's Hotels.
   The move comes one month after the announcement that
Scott's Hotels was withdrawing from its franchise agreement
with Holiday Inn Worldwide, a unit of Bass PLC, over a
dispute on franchise rights.
