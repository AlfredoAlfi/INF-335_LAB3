International:
   Court Refuses to Give Bond
   Extension on Paying Debts
The financier, who lost control of his financially
troubled flagship company, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., in 1990,
is fighting a long-running legal battle against personal
bankruptcy. Mr. Bond's lawyers said he will appeal to the
Federal Court against Friday's judgment upholding the
bankruptcy notice.
   The bankruptcy claim arises from a loan taken out by Mr.
Bond's private company, Dallhold Investments Pty. Ltd., which
borrowed the funds to finance its share of a nickel project.
The three banks, Hongkong Bank, Tricontinental Corp. and Bank
of New Zealand Ltd., can apply for the appointment of a
trustee to take over Bond's assets.
