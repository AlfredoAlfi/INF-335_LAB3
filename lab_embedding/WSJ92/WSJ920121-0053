   Human Membrane Protein
   Is Produced in Experiments
The cystic fibrosis-related protein has up to now been
very difficult to produce in large quantities, the
researchers said. The new transgenic production technique
should speed progress in cystic fibrosis treatment research,
the scientists said.
   The report is the latest use of transgenic animals to
produce drugs in milk. Scientists expect transgenic
techniques eventually will lead to commercial "pharming," or
using herds of animals as living pharmaceutical factories.
Pharming is expected to give the biotechnology industry a
cheaper, better way to make genetically engineered drugs now
made in vats by bacteria and other microbes that have been
altered to produce human proteins.
