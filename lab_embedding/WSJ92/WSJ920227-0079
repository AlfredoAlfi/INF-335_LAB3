Marketing  Media:
   FCC Study Concludes
   Radio Would Benefit
   From Consolidation
The staff used the report to justify its controversial
recommendations that the FCC abolish national ownership
limits and allow joint venture agreements to continue without
restrictions. Current FCC rules bar broadcasters from owning
more than 12 AM, 12 FM and 12 television stations. The agency
is expected to vote March 12 on the proposed rule changes.
Opponents contend that the sweeping deregulation advocated by
the FCC staff will lead to less diversity in programming,
particularly in smaller markets.
   The report showed a big profitability gap between large
stations and small ones, with the top 50 revenue producers
accounting for more than 11% of industry revenue and about
50% of profit in 1990. About half of the nation's nearly
11,000 radio stations lost money in 1990. And as of January,
287 licensed stations weren't operating, including 153 that
went silent in the past 12 months.
