Business Brief -- Landmark Graphics Corp.:
   Fiscal 3rd-Quarter Revenue
   Expected to Be Down 17%
Landmark said the weak domestic energy market has caused
energy companies to reduce U.S. operations and delay
purchases of Landmark's products. International demand is
strong but not sufficient to offset the domestic downturn,
Landmark said. The company doesn't expect the domestic
situation to improve before 1993. The company forecasts
fiscal fourth-quarter net of about 15 cents a share on
revenue of about $24 million vs. $3.6 million, or 35 cents a
share, on revenue of $26.4 million a year earlier.
