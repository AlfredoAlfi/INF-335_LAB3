Business Brief -- JWP Inc.:
   JWP Bids Stock to Acquire
   Rest of Resource Recycling
JWP, a Purchase, N.Y., technical services concern proposed
a tax-free merger of one of its units and Resource Recycling
which would give shareholders one JWP share for every three
Resource Recycling shares. JWP shares were quoted on the Big
Board at $18.375, down 12.5 cents.
   The offer to acquire the rest of Resource Recycling comes
six months after it purchased the initial stake in the
Binghamton, N.Y., concern. Last fall, it bought a 34%
interest at an average price of $9.83 a share. The current
offer values Resource Recycling at about $6.125 a share.
   Lawrence J. Schorr, Resource Recycling's president, said
the board would consider the unsolicited offer today but
declined further comment.
