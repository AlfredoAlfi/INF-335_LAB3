Letters to the Editor:
   I Believe He Believed
   What He Said He Didn't
This is important for it sheds doubt on Mr. Sick's
presentation of himself as a dispassionate witness. Further,
if he can't even give a straight account of his own thinking
three years ago, how can we take seriously his elaborate
hypothesis about U.S.-Iranian relations in 1980?
