New York City Puts
   Jobs Losses for 1991
   As High as 185,000
More job losses are expected, with a possible 100,000 New
Yorkers losing their jobs in 1992, and 60,000 in 1993.
   Echoing previous estimates, Ms. Holtzman said the city's
deficit could reach $357 million for the fiscal year ending
June 30. Additional medical assistance costs, deficits in
special city lottery funds and business tax receipts, and
other recent developments have contributed to the overall
budget deficit.
   Ms. Holtzman estimated that the deficit could increase to
$3.3 billion for fiscal 1996.
