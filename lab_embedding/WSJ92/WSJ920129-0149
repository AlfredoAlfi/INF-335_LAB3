Pepper...and Salt
As medical findings
   Continue to unfold,
   There are many people
   Who put the facts on hold.
   It's not that they're going
   On any sort of strike --
   They're waiting for findings
   That they really like.

   When profit taking tumbles stocks,
   It's not hard to divine
   The profit being taken is,
   Unfortunately, mine.
