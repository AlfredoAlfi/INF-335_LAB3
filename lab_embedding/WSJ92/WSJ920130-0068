International Brief -- Source Perrier S.A.:
   Counterattack Is Launched
   Against Nestle Takeover Bid
Nestle, which launched its 13.3 billion French franc
($2.44 billion) bid this month, said it had struck an
agreement with BSN, a French foods company, to split
Perrier's assets between them. So, if its bid proves
successful, Nestle will shed one of Perrier's leading
still-water brands, Volvic, selling it to BSN for 20% of the
total price paid for Perrier.
   Mr. Vincent and his lawyers argue that any such agreement
is tantamout to an entente between two rivals to put the
market leader out of business and then to divide up amicably
the French mineral water market between them.
   Officials at both BSN and Nestle declined to comment on
the move, Perrier's first significant attempt to counter the
bid since it was announced.
