International Brief -- Marriott Corp.:
   Joint Reservation System
   To Start With New Otani
Marriott, which was the first foreign hotel chain to be
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has been looking for a
way to establish a presence in Japan. But with Japan's high
land prices and the slowing of the country's economy, opening
a new hotel presented difficulties.
   New Otani, which has 15 first-class hotels in Japan, has
been expanding abroad and has four hotels outside Japan. The
bookings link with Marriott could help New Otani's recent
sluggish occupancy rates, analysts said.
