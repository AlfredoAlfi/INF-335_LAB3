Daewoo's Role in North Korea
Mr. Kim was the first South Korean businessman to be
officially invited by the North. He and Pyongyang officials
agreed to set up nine joint-venture plants for consumer goods
in North Korea.
   A Daewoo spokesman said yesterday that the group wouldn't
monopolize interKorean projects. A group of businessmen from
different companies and industries, organized by Daewoo, will
visit the North soon to pursue the proposed projects, he
said.
   South and North Korea recently have moved to end four
decades of hostility, by signing historic pacts on
reconciliation and denuclearization.
