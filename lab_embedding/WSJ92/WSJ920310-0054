International:
   Ambrosiano Prosecutors
   Seek Jail for De Benedetti
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Defense lawyers have yet to present their cases and a
decision from the court isn't expected for at least two to
three weeks, court officials said.
   Mr. De Benedetti, who is chairman of computer group Ing.
C. Olivetti  Co., is being tried in connection with his
65-day reign as deputy chairman of the Milan-based bank
through Jan. 22, 1982. He has repeatedly denied any
wrongdoing.
   He resigned the bank post in January 1982, citing
disagreements with Ambrosiano's chairman, Roberto Calvi. Mr.
Calvi was found hanged from London's Blackfriar bridge in
June 1982, a few months before the bank's collapse.
