Marketing Brief -- Quaker State Corp.:
   Company Ordered to Stop
   Airing Ad for Motor Oil
The 30-second advertisement, which ran as recently as
Sunday, concerns 10W-30 motor oil used in automobile engines.
It was produced by Grey Advertising Inc., New York, and first
aired in November.
   Judge Haight found the tests weren't so conclusive,
especially as to the issue of whether Quaker State motor oil
does a better job in protecting engines against wear. And the
falsity of that claim, Judge Haight wrote, "damns the entire
commercial beyond the hope of redemption."
   Quaker State, Oil City, Pa., said it will appeal the
ruling, but will withdraw the advertisements in the interim.
A spokesman said 10W-30 is its largest selling motor oil, and
that Quaker State has about 14% of the market for all grades
of motor oil.
