CenTrust Ex-Official
   Is Ordered to Prison
   For Civil Contempt
CenTrust, which had invested heavily in junk bonds through
Drexel Burnham Lambert, was shut down by federal regulators
in 1990. Its failure could cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   Mr. Paul's attorney, Aubrey Harwell of Nashville, Tenn.,
said he immediately filed an appeal of Judge Marcus's order
with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals for a ruling on
whether the orders to surrender the documents pose a
violation to Mr. Paul's Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. In addition, Mr. Harwell said that the
federal authorities who closed CenTrust have copies of the
documents at issue. "There are other sources that government
prosecutors could get those records-namely, other government
agencies," he said.
