Who's News:
   Penn Central Names
   New President, Sets
   General Cable Spinoff
Mr. Walker was named to a new post as president and chief
executive officer of Penn Central's newly formed unit,
General Cable Corp. General Cable now holds recently spun off
Lindner interests in wire and cable, materials handling
equipment and marine equipment manufacturing businesses.
   The spinoff will be effected by a distribution of one
share of General Cable stock for every four shares of Penn
Central stock, Penn Central said. As part of the spinoff,
Penn Central said it would retain a $230 million, 10-year
9.98% senior subordinated note of General Cable's. Under
certain circumstances, General Cable would have the option of
paying interest on the note during the first five years
through delivery of "pay-in-kind" debt securities.
   The company said it expects the spinoff to be completed in
June, after a formal announcement of the distribution by Penn
Central's board.
   Also, Keith E. Lindner, 32, president and chief operating
officer of Chiquita Brands International Inc., was named a
director of Penn Central, succeeding Mr. Walker who resigned
from the board yesterday.
