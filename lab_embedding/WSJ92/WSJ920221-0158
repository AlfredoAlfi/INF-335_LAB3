Pepper...and Salt
You really cannot train a cat,
   Their brains don't work that way.
   No matter what you try to do,
   They simply won't obey.
   They cannot be intelligent,
   More likely are peabrained,
   But when you stop and think of it,
   It's we who have been trained.

   Corporate Gridlock
                                                                                                       

   Testing ideas to see if they'll fly
   Is good corporate policy these days;
   But at our place brainstorms, too often,
   Face holding patterns and flight delays.
