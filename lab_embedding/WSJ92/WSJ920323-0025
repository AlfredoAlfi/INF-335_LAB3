Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
Once bitten by a false recovery, manufacturers and other
businesses are "more hesitant to rehire people than they were
in past slow-growth periods," Mr. Zukowski says. Waiting to
see if the consumer rebound is real, companies will prefer to
answer demand by extending employee work weeks rather than by
adding jobs. Meanwhile, layoffs continue. The PaineWebber
economist says that initial jobless claims probably rose by
7,000 to 440,000 in the week ending March 14.
