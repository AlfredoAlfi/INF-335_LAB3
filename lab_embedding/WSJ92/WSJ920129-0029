Business Brief -- Sun Microsystems Inc.:
   Firm Says Profit, Sales Rose
   By 20% in Fiscal 2nd Period
Kevin C. Melia, chief financial officer, said that while
sales in the U.S. and Japan were "robust," sales in Europe
remained "sluggish." He also said overall profitability
increased during the year. Mr. Melia said he is optimistic
about the future but that increased competition and "economic
uncertainties" could temporarily harm revenue and margins."
   For the six months, Sun had net of $74.2 million, or 74
cents a share, compared with 65.2 million, or 65 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $1.7 billion from
$1.4 billion.
   The earnings were in line with analysts' estimates. In
national over the counter trading, Sun closed at $33.875 a
share, up 87.5 cents.
