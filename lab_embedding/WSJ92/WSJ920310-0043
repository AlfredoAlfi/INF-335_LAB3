International Brief -- Aegon N.V.:
   Dutch Insurer Set to Buy
   75% of Hungarian Company
But an executive in Budapest, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Aegon would pay around $50 million for the
75% stake. The Hungarian state would retain about 20%, and
Allami Biztosito employees would be eligible to acquire the
remaining shares.
   The state also would retain a "special share" giving it
the power to veto certain moves by Allami Biztosito, such as
changes in the capital structure.
   He added that Hungary's State Property Agency, which
oversees privatization, hopes to conclude an agreement with
Aegon by the end of March. The main sticking point in the
talks with Aegon appears to be responsibility for any
environmental cleanup costs that might arise at companies
that have held insurance policies from Allami Biztosito.
