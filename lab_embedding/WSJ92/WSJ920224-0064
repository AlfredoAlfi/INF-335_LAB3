Consumer Confidence
   In Australia Rose 12%
   From the Prior Month
The government has scheduled an economic statement for
Feb. 26 that is designed to boost jobs and the economy.
   "While respondents still feel gloomy about economic
conditions over the coming year, the net balance of
pessimists had fallen from 58% in January to 38%" in
February, the statement said. Bill Evans, chief economist
with Westpac, said consumers have indicated a marked lift in
their readiness to spend, "and this reflected their less
pessimistic view of the economy."
   Mr. Evans said the result should be "good news for
retailers," but he warned that the improvement in the index
will need to be sustained in coming months before Australia
can be more optimistic about economic prospects for 1992.
