Business Brief -- Alexander Energy Corp.:
   Company and Bradmore Say
   Merger to Still Take Place
The delay was caused because the bank didn't complete the
reserve review in time for Friday's planned meeting, the
spokesman said.
   Alexander, an oil and gas exploration and production
company, said other means of financing as well as
restructuring of the transaction are being considered, should
there be a problem with the bank.
   Terms of Alexander's acquisition of Bradmore, based in
Oklahoma City, remain the same $9.7 million cash and stock
combination announced last fall, the spokesman said.
