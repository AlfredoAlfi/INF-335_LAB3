Credit Ratings:
   Moody's Is Reviewing
   Royal Trustco Debt
   For Possible Rating Cut
Under review by Moody's are Royal Trustco's senior debt,
currently rated single-A-3, and its subordinated debt, which
carries a Baa-1 rating. Moody's said it also is reviewing
Royal Trust's single-A-1 rating for senior debt and long-term
deposits, and its Prime-1 rating for short-term deposits.
   A Royal Trust spokeswoman said the Moody's review seems to
reflect weak economic conditions that are affecting a number
of financial-services companies. Still, she said, Royal Trust
was "disappointed" by the review, given that the company was
profitable in 1991.
