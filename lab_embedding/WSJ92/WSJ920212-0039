Business Brief:
   Cyclops Industries
   Posts $33 Million Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
Cyclops Chief Executive Officer James F. Will said
"progress continues" toward a possible sale to specialty
steelmaker Armco Inc., Parisippany, N.J. Mr. Will said the
company's 1992 outlook depends "largely upon an economic
recovery from the recession and its impact on the demand and
selling prices for Cyclops' products." Cyclops makes
flat-rolled stainless and carbon steel, and high-performance
alloy and tubular steel products.
   For the year, Cyclops posted a net loss of $41.2 million,
or $5.79 a share, on sales of $1.06 billion, compared with a
1990 net loss of $3 million, or 42 cents a share, including
$9.7 million in restructuring charges, on sales of $1.2
billion.
   Cyclops said its largest segment, flat-rolled steel
products, suffered most in the recessionary economy from
reduced shipments and lower prices for steel used in the
automobile, construction and appliance industries. In
high-performance alloys, Cyclops plans further restructuring
and downsizing of its Cytemp Specialty Steel facility in
Titusville, Pa.
