Business Brief -- Club Mediterranee S.A.:
   Loss Posted for Fiscal Year,
   Partly Due to Gulf War
Club Med's recent diversification efforts into air
transport also weighed heavily on the balance sheet. The
company said it had a provision of 138 million francs for its
stake in Air Minerve, while losses at its Club Aquarius
affiliate -- which comprised the operations of Air Liberte --
came to 53 million francs.
   Disregarding the charter losses, Club Med's 1990/91 bottom
line showed a net profit of 173 million francs, down from a
comparable profit of 423 million francs the previous year.
   Despite the loss, Club Med said it elected to pay out a
per-share net dividend of six francs this year, payable in
the form of new shares.
