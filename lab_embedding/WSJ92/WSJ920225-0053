International Brief -- Canon Inc.:
   Earnings in 1991 Fell 15%
   Despite 8.2% Rise in Sales
Canon declined to say whether the forecast was influenced
by expectations that sales at rival Minolta Camera Co. will
be hurt by the recent loss of a patent infringement suit
filed by Honeywell Inc. Honeywell said it plans to go after
Canon and other camera makers, but Canon said it is assured
its technology is its own.
   Separately, subsidiary Canon Sales Co. said it plans to
boost Japanese sales of workstations made by Next Computer
Inc. of the U.S. to 9,000 units this year from about 3,000
last year.
