Among the states anticipating the largest revenue
shortages are California ($2 billion to $3 billion), New York
($492 million to $875 million) and Maryland ($650 million).
Every state except Vermont is required to balance its budget
each year.
   The report describes the states' fiscal picture as similar
to that of one year ago, but more uniform from state to
state. On the one hand, fewer states this year are
forecasting revenue shortages in excess of 5%. But on the
other hand, such states as Washington, which one year ago
were relatively unaffected by the recession, expect state
revenues will come up short this year.
   On the expenditure side, 19 states are exceeding their
Medicaid budgets, even though Medicaid appropriations
increased 22% this year over last. In addition, 16 states
said spending on Aid to Families With Dependent Children and
other income-support programs is exceeding allocated amounts.
   Corrections spending, however, appears to be leveling off,
according to the report, with prison expenditures growing 8%
this year, down from 16% last year.
