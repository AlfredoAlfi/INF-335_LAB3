International Brief -- Hoogovens N.V.:
   Dutch Firm Says Provisions
   Will Result in Loss for '91
For the first half of 1991, the company posted a net
profit of 55 million guilders ($31.6 million).
   O.N.A. Van Royen, chairman, said that a number of external
factors had contributed to the poor results over 1991,
including disappointing economic developments, particularly
in the U.K. and U.S. Mr. Van Royen pointed to more positive
developments within the German economy.
   Mr. Van Royen said that as a result of the breakup of the
former Soviet Union, business activity in Eastern Europe had
considerably weakened. He said aluminum prices had fallen to
a disastrously low level because the Soviet Union had been
exporting large amounts of the metal to Western Europe at low
prices.
