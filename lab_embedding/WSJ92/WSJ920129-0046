Business Brief -- Sears, Roebuck  Co.:
   Allstate Unit Plans to Sell
   Its Operations in Canada
A spokeswoman said it is a "good time" to sell Allstate of
Canada, because it had "such a successful year. We have a
chance now to raise capital to enhance our financial strength
overall."
   In 1990, the Canadian business earned $10.1 million, and
had assets of $925.2 million. It contributes less than 4% of
Allstate's consolidated operations.
   The spokeswoman emphasized that the sale "isn't part of an
Allstate strategy" to sell off parts of its business. "We are
selling to focus our growth in other areas," she said.
   As part of its decision to focus growth, Allstate of
Canada also said it may sell its commercial division in a
separate transaction.
