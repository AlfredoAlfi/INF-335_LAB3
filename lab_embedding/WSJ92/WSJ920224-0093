   Decision to Bar Posner
   From DWG Is Stayed
   Pending an Appeal
The original decision, a sharply worded ruling handed down
Feb. 14 by Judge Thomas D. Lambros, a U.S. District Court
judge in Cleveland, suspended Mr. Posner from running DWG for
120 days, pending an audit to determine whether the
73-year-old financier had been "plundering" his own business.
The judge barred Mr. Posner from selling his 46.3% stake in
DWG and ordered both his salary and the salary of his son
Steven, the company's vice president, placed in trust.
   DWG, the centerpiece of Mr. Posner's financial empire, has
interests in Arby's Inc., the restaurant company, and Royal
Crown Cos., a soft-drink concern, as well as several other
companies. Judge Lambros said he issued his decision after
concluding that Mr. Posner had violated terms settling a
takeover dispute between DWG and Granada Investments Inc., a
New York investment firm and DWG shareholder.
