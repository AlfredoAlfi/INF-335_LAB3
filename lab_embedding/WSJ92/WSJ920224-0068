Who's News:
   Orion Pictures Taps
   White as President
   And Chief Executive
Mr. White joined Orion in 1987 as president and chief
operating officer of Orion Home Video.
   Orion Pictures, with headquarters in New York and Los
Angeles, filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws
in December. "During the difficult period of Orion's
reorganization, no one made a greater contribution to the
company than Len White," said Mr. Bernstein.
   The board of Orion is considering a revised plan for New
Line Cinema Corp. to take control of Orion, and a decision is
expected within the next two weeks, officials from both
companies said.
   If the deal with New Line is approved, it is expected that
Orion would continue to operate as a separate company,
although heavily controlled by New Line. It isn't clear
whether New Line would again change management if it takes
control of the studio.
