Nova Corp. of Alberta
   Natural Gas Pipeline
   Ruptures, Causes Fire
The rupture and fire also resulted in a short-term
reduction in gas transportation from Alberta to British
Columbia and Saskatchewan. A spokesman for Nova said that
while the company usually ships about 7.4 billion cubic feet
of gas through three export points to British Columbia and
Saskatchewan, those volumes were cut to 4.6 billion cubic
feet. He said shipments could be back to normal levels by the
end of the week. Nova operates the natural gas pipeline
system in the province of Alberta.
   The cause of the rupture isn't known, Nova said. It added
that it expects an investigation to take several weeks.
