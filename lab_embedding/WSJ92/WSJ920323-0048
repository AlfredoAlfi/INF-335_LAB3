Broker Firm's Short Notice
   For New Margin Is Upheld
At that time, most of Capital's customers held what are
known as gold "strangles," a form of futures combination that
is profitable if the price of a commodity remains relatively
stable, but that is riskier in volatile markets.
   On the day of the crash, Linnco raised the margins for
Capital customers fivefold, to $15,000 per option, or about
one-third the underlying value of the option. It gave the
customers only one hour to satisfy the higher margin
requirements. None of the customers did so, and their
positions were liquidated.
   A federal district court in Chicago had granted a summary
judgment in favor of the defendants. The three-judge appeals
court panel found that a "one-hour notice to post additional
margin, despite previous practices, is reasonable where a
contract specifically provides for margin calls on options at
any time and without notice."
