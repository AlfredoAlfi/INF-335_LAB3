International:
   French Consumption Dropped
Consumption in December was notably weaker in durable
goods, down 1.3% from the previous month. This reflected in
part weaker sales of radio, television and stereo equipment.
   Automobile registrations were roughly flat, while textile
sales were down about 1%.
