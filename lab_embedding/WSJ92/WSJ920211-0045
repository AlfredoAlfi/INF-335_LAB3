Business Brief -- Honeywell Inc.:
   Company Planning to Aid
   Entrepreneurs' Patent Suits
Honeywell said it will use $1 million from that award to
launch the fund. The control-equipment maker plans to build
the fund to $10 million with help from other U.S. technology
companies, which would replenish it with money from patent
dispute awards or settlements.
   "A small business or entrepreneur would not have had the
resources to follow through as we did with Minolta," said
Christopher J. Steffen, Honeywell executive vice president
and chief financial and administrative officer.
   Mr. Steffen added that the fund would help protect the
"knowledge, ingenuity and products" of U.S. companies from
their overseas counterparts.
