Key Tronic Grants
   Hiller Group Option
   For One-Third Stake
Key Tronic also said Mr. Hiller received an option to
acquire an additional one million shares, at $6 each, from
its largest shareholder, LGZ Inc., which is owned by the
company's founding family. That option was granted subject to
shareholder approval of the option granted to the Hiller
partnership. The LGZ option is exercisable before March 2,
1995.
   Key Tronic currently has 7.7 million common shares
outstanding. The stock, which traded as low as $1.875 in
December, closed at $5.75 a share, up 25 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading Friday.
   Mr. Hiller was named chief executive early last week, and
an associate, Royce G. Pearson, was named Key Tronic's
president and chief operating officer and a director. Also
named directors were Kenneth Holtby, a retired Boeing Co.
executive, and Dale Pilz, former chief executive of GTE
Sprint Communications Corp., increasing board membership to
nine.
