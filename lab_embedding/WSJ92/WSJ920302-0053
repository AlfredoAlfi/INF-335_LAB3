Economy:
   Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
Mr. Moran estimates that the manufacturing and retail
trade sectors, although improving, still lost a net 20,000
jobs each last month, partially offsetting net hiring in
services and government.
   Those who have jobs probably worked longer and for
slightly better hourly pay. Mr. Moran estimates the average
workweek was extended as much as 0.2 hours, while average
hourly earnings probably rose a modest 0.2% last month. "We
really don't have much of an inflation risk now," he says.
"We won't see wages misbehaving."
   All told, the Daiwa economist says, the employment data
won't be strong enough to signal the beginning of a sustained
or substantial economic recovery.
   Ditto for January personal income and spending data.
Reflecting the net loss of 91,000 jobs in January, personal
income that month likely fell 0.2%, Mr. Moran says. Spending
growth thus was limited to 0.3%, he estimates, with most of
that on nondurable goods and services.
   Households "still don't have the income level to support
robust spending," he says.
