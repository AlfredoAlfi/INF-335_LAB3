Law:
   Lloyd's of London
   Seeks to Block BCCI
   Settlement in U.S.
Under terms of a proposed plea agreement announced Dec.
19, BCCI would plead guilty to violating the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, and it would
forfeit its estimated $550 million of U.S. assets to the U.S.
government. The U.S. would keep half the funds to prop up two
U.S. banking companies that BCCI secretly owned, including
First American Bancshares Inc., the largest bank holding
company in Washington. The U.S. would provide the remainder
of the money to the bank's foreign liquidators.
   But in a motion filed in connection with the criminal
proceedings pending against BCCI here, Lloyd's argued that
the settlement would violate the appropriations clause of the
U.S. Constitution, which requires action by Congress for
payments by the Treasury.
   A number of BCCI creditors, including Panama, have
objected to the proposed settlement, claiming that it would
limit their opportunity to obtain some portion of what
remains of BCCI's assets. U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens
Green is scheduled to hear arguments on the proposed plea
agreement Thursday.
