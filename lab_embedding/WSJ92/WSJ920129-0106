International:
   Fiat Posts a 70% Drop
   In 1991 Operating Profit
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Revenue rose 1.1% to 57.828 trillion lire from 57.209
trillion lire.
   Fiat didn't disclose any net income figures, but industry
sources estimated that, based on cash flow figures, group net
is likely to have fallen by 48% to around 1.1 trillion lire
from 2.136 trillion lire in 1990.
   Because of a sharp drop in minority interests, profit
attributable to shareholders is likely to be around one
trillion lire, down 38% from 1.613 trillion lire in 1990, the
sources said.
   Still, chairman and controlling shareholder Gianni Agnelli
termed the preliminary results "positive, especially when
viewed in the context of the current world economic
situation."
   Fiat Auto S.p.A., the group's core car division, managed
to remain in the black last year.
   Mr. Agnelli said that Fiat S.p.A., which functions as a
holding company, will post a smaller profit for 1991 than the
1.417 trillion lire of the previous year.
   Dividends will be decided in May, when the company will
announce full results for 1991.
