International Brief -- GPA Group PLC:
   Share Offering Is Planned
   At Four Exchanges in June
Despite its healthy balance sheet and consistently good
earnings, GPA certainly could use the extra funds. The
leasing firm is awaiting delivery on $12.1 billion in
aircraft by the year 2000 and has options for an additional
$9.5 billion.
   Analysts have been eagerly talking of the expected share
issue. "We've seen the worst period in the history of the
airline industry since World War II, and GPA has pulled
through it with $70 million net profit a quarter," said Chris
Avery of Smith New Court Securities Ltd.
   Goldman, Sachs  Co. and Merrill Lynch  Co. will be lead
managers in the U.S. Nomura International PLC will be the
global coordinator of the offer and lead manager in Europe.
