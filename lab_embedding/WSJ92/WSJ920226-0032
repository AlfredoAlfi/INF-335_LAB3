   Japan's Financial Leaders
   Call for Interest-Rate Cut
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The rate is currently at 4.5% after the Bank of Japan cut
it 0.5 percentage point Dec. 30. The rate is what the central
bank charges for its loans to banks.
   Echoing that sentiment, Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata said
that considering the state of the economy, "appropriate"
monetary policy measures must be taken.
   One stock trader predicted the central bank would cut the
key rate within three or four days.
   Speaking at a regular news conference after a semi-weekly
cabinet meeting, Mr. Watanabe also said he would like to see
the yen strengthen but he didn't specify any exchange rate.
Recently, the yen weakened to around 129 to the dollar.
