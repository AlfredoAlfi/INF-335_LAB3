Business Brief:
   Cypress Semiconductor Posts 28% Drop
   In Profit for Quarter, Cites Slow Market
Revenue increased 13% to $71 million from $63 million,
Cypress said.
   The company said profits were hurt by a sluggish
semiconductor market and costs associated with manufacturing,
asset purchases, sales and research. Adding to its woes were
$2.2 million in orders that weren't shipped because of
manufacturing and distribution problems, and $3.5 million in
cost overruns at a wafer fabrication plant. T.J. Rodgers,
president and chief executive officer, said the manufacturing
and distribution problems "will be eliminated quickly."
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Cypress shares dropped $3.625 to $14.125.
   For 1992, the company expects "some improvement" in
earnings for the current first quarter, and further
improvement in the second quarter, a spokesman said.
   Analyst Michael Stark, of Robertson, Stephens  Co., said
that he expects Cypress to show a gradual improvement
throughout the year if it controls costs and fills orders
efficiently.
   For all of 1991, the company's earnings increased 2.8% to
$34.2 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with $33.2
million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
27% to $286.8 million from $225.2 million.
   Cypress hasn't reported a drop in quarterly net income
since the third quarter of 1987.
