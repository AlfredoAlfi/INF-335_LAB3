Dell Marketing Pact
   With Xerox to Hasten
   Dell's Foreign Growth
Xerox said the Dell agreement will give it a line of
aggressively priced computer systems to market in Latin
America, where it already is the largest reseller of
International Business Machines Corp.'s PS/2 line.
   The products will be available in all 19 countries within
30 to 60 days, Dell said.
   Under the agreement, Xerox will market Dell products in
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras,
Jamaica, Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Dell said the agreement doesn't
include Brazil, which has barred personal computer imports
since 1975, or Mexico, where Xerox doesn't market personal
computer systems.
   In over-the-counter trading late yesterday, Dell was
quoted at $39.25, up $3.25.
