Technology Brief -- International Business Machines:
   Price of Laptop Computer
   Is Reduced Again, by 32%
Despite the repeated price cuts, though, the IBM laptop
still hasn't overcome its initial image as an overpriced
machine, and sales have been modest. In addition, although
the laptop was close to the leading edge of technology a year
ago, many competitors have overtaken the machine. The IBM
machine uses an 80386SX processor that runs at a clock speed
of 20 megahertz and contains a 60-megabyte hard drive, but
many laptops now have much faster processors and offer more
storage capacity.
   The price reduction for the laptop, known as the L40SX,
appears to be designed partly to clear the way for a planned
announcement in two weeks of a slightly less powerful but
lighter machine, whose list price is expected to be about
$2,500. That machine is expected to be the start of a series
of laptop and notebook announcements this year by the Armonk,
N.Y., company, although the machines are being rolled out
more slowly than was once expected. The machines had been
expected to start appearing last fall, based on indications
from IBM early last year.
