Business Brief -- Trump Organization:
   Officials Boost Swap Offer
   To Bondholders of Casino
The offer to pay $10 cash per $1,000 face amount of bonds
tendered remained unchanged, as did the target for the swap,
$25 million to $75 million. The offer, which was due to
expire at midnight, was extended to January 15.
   Unlike Donald Trump's two other Atlantic City casinos, the
Trump Plaza has not defaulted on its bond debt. But it is
seeking to cut the size of the $25 million sinking fund
payment it must make in each of the next several years.
