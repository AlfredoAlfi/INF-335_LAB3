Business Brief -- Magma Copper Co.:
   Feasibility Study Concluded
   On Robinson Copper Site
Magma says it hopes to receive government permits to
operate the mine by the middle of this year, and to be in
full production at the end of 1994.
   Magma acquired the Robinson property in two transactions
in 1990 and 1991 for about $55 million. Production from the
property will increase Magma's annual copper output about 20%
from 1991 levels, the company said.
   Magma common stock rose 75 cents yesterday to close at
$6.50 a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
