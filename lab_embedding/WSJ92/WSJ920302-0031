International Brief -- Nestle S.A.:
   EC Commission Launches
   Inquiry Into Bid for Perrier
If the commission states it has doubts, it has another
four months to conduct a deeper inquiry. It can block or
alter mergers that it finds harm competition in the EC by
creating or strengthening a dominant position.
   In a statement, the EC said it had been notified of the
proposed takeover and believed it could fall under its merger
code.
   Nestle and its French ally, Cie. de Suez, have made clear
that if their bid is successful they will spin off Perrier's
Volvic mineral-water business and sell it to French food
group BSN S.A., partly to avoid raising competition concerns
in the EC.
