Business Brief -- Magna Group Inc.:
   Concern Says Loan Reserve
   Will Bring 4th-Period Loss
Magna said the decrease in earnings to $3.8 million from
$18.1 million is due to a provision for loan losses of $29.5
million, offsetting continued strong operating performance.
The provision was increased by $15.7 million in the fourth
quarter.
   The company said the acquisition of Landmark Bancshares
Corp., completed on December 20. However, Landmark's results
subsequent to the acquisition date aren't material and won't
be included in Magna's 1991 income statement.
