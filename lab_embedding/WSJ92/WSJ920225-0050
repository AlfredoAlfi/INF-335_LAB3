Canada Reduces by 35%
   Catch Limit for Cod Fish
Canadian Fisheries Minister John Crosbie set the total
allowable 1992 cod catch at 120,000 metric tons, down from a
previous level of 185,000 tons. The quota in the first six
months of this year will be limited to 25,000 tons, half of
the amount caught in the same period last year. A metric ton
is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   The Canadian government sets catch quotas annually to
preserve fishing stocks.
   Mr. Crosbie banned cod fishing during peak spawning
seasons. He also suspended harvesting of capelin, a main food
source for cod.
   Mr. Crosbie also said the government will study ways to
expand Canada's seal hunt. Fishermen blame part of the cod
shortage on a growing seal herd, which feeds on cod and
capelin.
   The fishing industry also put some of the blame on
overfishing by foreign fleets, particularly Spanish and
Portuguese vessels, near Canada's territorial boundary. A
Canadian delegation is to meet later this week with European
Community Commission officials to ask them to reduce their
cod catch in the North Atlantic waters.
