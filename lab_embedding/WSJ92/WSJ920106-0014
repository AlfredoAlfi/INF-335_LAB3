USF&G Corp. Cuts
   Operations in 7 States,
   Blames Regulations
It also will stop writing new personal lines in Arizona,
Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Rhode Island and South Carolina
Jan. 15.
   Chairman Norman Blake Jr. wrote in a letter to USF&G
agents that the company wasn't making enough money from those
lines because of regulations. Company spokeswoman Kerrie
Burch-DeLuca wouldn't say whether lines in those states were
losing money, only that they were unprofitable.
   USF&G reported a loss of $136 million for the first nine
months of 1991 and had a loss of $569 million in 1990. It
doesn't expect a profit this year, Ms. Burch-DeLuca said.
   The company began an austerity program last year to return
USF&G to the traditional insurance company it was before an
unsuccessful diversification in the late 1980s.
   The company has eliminated 3,000 of 12,000 jobs through
Dec. 31, closed 18 offices through the country, shed
money-losing enterprises and slashed its dividend nearly 90%.
   USF&G is the largest writer of workers' compensation
insurance in Mississippi with 17% of the total market. The
announcement has caused four other, smaller carriers to
either cut back or withdraw their workers' compensation lines
in Mississippi, said State Insurance Commissioner George
Dale.
