International Brief -- Royal Nedlloyd Group N.V.:
   Firm Says 2 of Its Creditors
   Converted Loans to Shares
The new shares increase the number outstanding by 11%.
Nedlloyd didn't disclose how the shares were valued, but said
it was based on the market price at the time an accord was
reached with the two institutions earlier this year.
Yesterday, Nedlloyd shares closed on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange at 63.30 guilders ($34), giving the new shares a
total value of about 141 million guilders ($76 million).
   Nedlloyd said the conversion would reduce its interest
costs nearly 10 million guilders a year.
   The conversion also dilutes the stake in Nedlloyd
controlled by Norwegian investor Torstein Hagen. Mr. Hagen,
recently named to Nedlloyd's supervisory board after a long
spat with the company over strategy, has said two companies
he heads had a combined stake of 27% in Nedlloyd. Based on
Nedlloyd's expanded share capital, that stake would currently
be about 24%. Mr. Hagen wasn't available for comment.
