   Isis Seeks Approval
   To Start Human Tests
   On Genital Warts Drug
Antisense drugs are believed to be capable of arresting
disease processes in their earliest stage of development by
interacting with specific chemical receptors in the body that
are associated with specific diseases.
   The filing is an important milestone for three-year-old
Isis, which is hoping that the proposed drug will eventually
become its first commercial product.
   If and when permission is granted, tests could begin
within a few days.
   Isis's new compound, known as Isis 2105, is the first drug
with the potential to cure the virus that causes genital
warts, Mr. Crooke said. Current treatments, including
surgical removal, don't prevent recurrences of the warts.
   Genital warts, the most common sexually transmitted viral
disease, is a growing health problem.
   While Mr. Crooke declined to estimate the potential market
for a cure for the disease, he said that . . . "it would
represent a substantial opportunity in pharmaceutical
product-type terms." Typically, "substantial" pharmaceutical
products generate in excess of $100 million in annual sales,
Mr. Crooke said.
