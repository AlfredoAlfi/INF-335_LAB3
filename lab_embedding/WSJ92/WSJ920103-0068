Toys `R' Us Sales Increase
In his regular post-holiday letter to shareholders,
Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive, said the No. 1
toy retailer's sales "steadily improved throughout the
period, with December strengthening to double digit
increases." Same-store sales rose 7.9% for the Christmas
season, well ahead of the 2.4% increase for the 11 months
ended Dec. 28.
   Mr. Lazarus wrote that the gains reflected an increase in
market share and came despite some product shortages and
lower consumer confidence.
   Overseas, sales in Germany and France were strong but
those in the United Kingdom and Canada were weak, he wrote.
Some 60,000 people visited the company's first store in Japan
in its first three days starting Dec. 20, marking "our most
successful grand opening ever," Mr. Lazarus wrote.
   Toys "R" Us said it plans to expand "aggressively" this
year, adding 85 to 90 new toy stores to the 623 it operates
in the U.S. and overseas. It will open its second Japanese
store next week and plans to open its first stores in Austria
and Portugal this year.
