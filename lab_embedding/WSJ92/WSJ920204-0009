CP said that, excluding the charges, it had a
fourth-quarter operating loss of C$29.2 million, primarily
because of the North American recession. In late New York

   In the fourth quarter, CP said, it wrote down the value of
its 19.9% stake in waste-services concern Laidlaw Inc. by
C$290.8 million, or 31.1%, reducing the carrying value on
CP's books of its 47.7 million Laidlaw shares to about C$644
million, or C$13.50 a Laidlaw share.
   Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. took a C$368.1
million charge in the fourth quarter related to the closure,
sale or restructuring of various mills. CP said its share of
the charge by 79.7%-owned CP Forest was C$293.3 million. CP

C$143 million related to employee dismissals. CP said other
units took a number of smaller charges in the fourth quarter.

or C$2.87 a share, including charges of C$897.6 million. In
1990, CP had net of C$355.3 million, or C$1.11 a share.
