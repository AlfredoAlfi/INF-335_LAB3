LEISURE  ARTS:
   Time Off: Diversions and Excursions March 3-16
Thirty-some objects from the Louvre's collection of works
from the ancient civilization centered in what is now Iraq,
eastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran.
Many of the pieces, which date from between 3500 B.C. and
2000 B.C., were created as temple offerings by or for the
kings of Sumer and Akkad, near modern Baghdad. The objects,
which include metalwork, sculptures, relief sculptures and
inscriptions in stone, were for the most part recovered by
French archaeological teams during the late 19th and early
20th centuries.

   Nearby at the National Gallery of Art, an exhibition
revolving around Sargent's early masterpiece "El Jaleo," an
8-by-11-foot painting of a flamenco dancer on stage. In
addition to the work, which was a highlight of the Paris
Salon of 1882, there are seven paintings and 40 drawings and
watercolors in which Sargent portrayed the Spanish dance
theme.
   After its National Gallery stint (Fourth Street at
Constitution Ave. NW, through Aug. 2, 202-737-4215), the show
will be on view in a smaller version at Boston's Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum (2 Palace Road, Sept. 10-Nov. 22).
