Sunshine Mining Unit
   Files Prepackaged
   Bankruptcy-Law Plan
However, the companies said, holders of 70% of the bonds
approved the reorganization plan, allowing the company to
seek bankruptcy-court approval of a prepackaged plan.
   Under the plan, each $1,000 face amount of the
silver-indexed bonds will be swapped for $200 market value of
Sunshine Mining common stock and a new 8% silver-indexed bond
with a face value of $800. Sunshine Precious Metals will be
able to pay interest and principal on the new bonds with
Sunshine Mining common shares. The new bonds mature in 2006,
while the eight series of old bonds matured between 1994 and
2004.
   If the plan is confirmed and Sunshine's stock price
doesn't change, the Sunshine Precious Metals bondholders will
own approximately 10% to 12% of Sunshine Mining's stock.
   The companies said the restructuring will allow Sunshine
Precious Metals to conserve its cash while it waits for
silver prices to turn higher.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Sunshine shares fell 12.5 cents to $1.
