Chicago Merc Can Lift
   Curbs on Speculative
   Currency Position
Managed futures funds, which invest pools of investor
money in various financial and commodity futures contracts,
are likely to be especially gratified by the change.
   "We requested this removal of position limits by the CFTC
to facilitate the burgeoning number of transactions by large
managed funds," said Merc Chairman John F. Sandner. "They
need the flexibility to transact business beyond what
traditional position limits allow."
   Big institutions such as banks and corporations have
always been able to exceed the 10,000-position limit by
certifying to the Merc that their intent was to hedge, or
ward off financial risk, rather than to speculate. But now
these big hedgers won't have to apply for hedging
"exemptions" to the 10,000-position limit.
   Under the changes, which will take effect at the close of
business Tuesday, speculative position limits will be ended
on Eurodollar, pound, mark, yen and Swiss franc futures and
options contracts at the Merc.
