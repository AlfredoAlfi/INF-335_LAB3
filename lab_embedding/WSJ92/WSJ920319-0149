Ehrlich Bober Ends Agreement
The announcement marks the second time Ehrlich Bober has
abandoned an effort to acquire an operating business. The
company, which divested itself of its main municipal bond
business a few years ago, backed out of negotiations to buy a
stake in two catering stores last year because of unspecified
"changed circumstances."
   Ehrlich Bober said it will continue to look at other
possible acquisitions.
