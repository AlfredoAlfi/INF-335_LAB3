Business Brief -- J.W. Gant Financial Inc.:
   Brokerage Firm, Unit Settle
   With Regulators in Florida
Under the settlement, Gant didn't admit to or deny any
violations. However, the settlement, with some exceptions,
prevents it from underwriting or making a market in so-called
"pink sheet" stocks, thinly traded securities that aren't
traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotation system. The settlement also called for
Gant to withdraw an application for a branch office and to
make a contribution to the state's securities anti-fraud
trust fund, which helps fund securities investigations.
   A spokesman for the comptroller's office said the state
can suspend Gant's license if it fails to comply with the
settlement.
