Business Brief -- Midlantic Corp.:
   Company Is Streamlining
   Management, Cutting Costs
The move is part of a restructuring plan announced last
year to change its management, shed assets and raise its thin
equity capital ratios.
   Under Garry J. Scheuring, Midlantic's new chairman and
chief executive, the company has hired a number of senior
executives and will bring in a new retail banking executive.
This latest reshuffling "definitely gives them more of an
organization structure, which they lacked" under the old
management, said John Works of Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
   Midlantic also said it hired ALTA Limited Partners, a bank
management consulting firm, to assist in expense reduction
and boosting revenue and customer service. Mr. Works said the
problem is primarily high levels of nonperforming assets
rather than an unwieldy cost base.
