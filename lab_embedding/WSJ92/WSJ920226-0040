Business Brief -- Everex Systems Inc.:
   Net of $1.2 Million Posted
   For Fiscal Second Quarter
The Fremont, Calif., maker of computer peripheral products
attributed the improved results to the introduction over the
past few months of a revised line of personal computers, a
new notebook computer and a multiprocessor machine that does
the work of minicomputers for a fraction of the cost.
   In its first half, Everex earned $1.6 million, or seven
cents a share, on sales of $264.3 million. In the
year-earlier period, the company had a loss of $15.1 million,
or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $196.9 million.
   Separately, Everex said it appointed Hal Clark, its
president, to its board. Mr. Clark, 55 years old, succeeds
Michael C.Y. Wong, who resigned to pursue his own business
interests.
