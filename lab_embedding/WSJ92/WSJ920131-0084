Chemical Banking
   Cuts Interest Rate
   On Its Credit Cards
The move is likely to put added pressure on other big
issuers to lower their rates. And it comes amid political and
media scrutiny over the disparity between credit card rates,
which have remained stubbornly high, and other interest rates
that have declined significantly. The industry average is
18.8%, while most of the largest issuers charge 19.8% on
credit card loans.
   But few large banks are likely to respond quickly,
industry experts said. "They're going to take a wait-and-see
attitude," said David Robertson, president of the Nilson
Report, an industry newsletter based in Santa Monica, Calif.
He noted that Manufacturers unsuccessfully attempted a
similiar rate cut three years ago. Although it helped
Manufacturers to gain some market share in the New York area
it wasn't as profitable as anticipated, Mr. Robertson said.
   A spokeswoman for Chemical, confirming the rate
reductions, said the bank will begin sending out notices to
its cardholders today. The rate cut is effective March 1.
Chemical, the sixth largest issuer of credit cards in the
U.S., had 6.8 million cardholders who racked up $6.8 billion
in charges last year.
