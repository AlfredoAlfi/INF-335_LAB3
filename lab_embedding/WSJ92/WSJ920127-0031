Business Brief -- Sterling Optical Corp.:
   Board Approves New Pact
   On the Sale of Retail Units
The transaction was recommended by the Unsecured
Creditors' Committee and by Sterling's investment bankers,
the Tribeca Group, and was supported by an unofficial
committee of its franchisees, Sterling said.
   Sterling Optical recently filed under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code. The company blamed its filing on
poor sales and the burden of debt payments.
