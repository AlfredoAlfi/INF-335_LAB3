Business Brief -- Guardian Royal Exchange PLC:
   Insurer's 1991 Pretax Loss
   Widened to $362.7 Million
The pretax loss was at the lower end of market
expectations.
   Guardian Royal's main problems in 1991 were in its home
market and weren't confined to mortgage indemnity. U.K.
underwriting losses, meaning before adding investment income,
widened to #332 million from #250 million.
   But Sid Hopkins, chief executive officer, said the U.K.
loss was smaller than he had expected because of an improved
performance in the second half. He said that "1991 reflects a
second year of unsatisfactory performance, but the figures do
mask an underlying improvement."
