   Olympics Help CBS
   Trounce Its Rivals
   In February Sweeps
According to network projections for the February sweeps,
CBS was watched by 16.8% of U.S. homes with television sets.
NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, followed with 13.1%, and
ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., trailed with 12.1%.
Fox attracted 8.7%, helped by stunt programming such as
showing two episodes of "The Simpsons" back-to-back. Last
February, Fox was watched by 7.1%.
   Although household ratings are used for bragging rights,
advertisers target women 18 to 49 years old, and CBS
outdistanced the competition in this demographic, as well,
with 11.1%. NBC followed with 8.7%, a 15% increase over last
February. ABC was third with 8.2%, and Fox followed with
6.3%. CBS Inc., which paid $243 million for the rights to the
Olympics and spent another $100 million in production costs,
said the hefty investment was worthwhile in drawing viewers
back to network television and for promoting its other
series.
