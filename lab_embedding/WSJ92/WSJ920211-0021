La Quinta Partnership
   Sues Holder Group
   Over Exchange Offer
In September, Ronin, led by Messrs. Nappo and Burke, said
it filed a proposed exchange offer with the Securities and
Exchange Commission calling for La Quinta unitholders to swap
their units for new Ronin preferred shares. The SEC has
issued three sets of comments on the filing, which Mr. Nappo
attributes, in part, to new regulations, and the offer hasn't
yet received regulatory clearance.
   At the same time, the dissident group also filed two
complaints against La Quinta in Delaware; yesterday, La
Quinta said it asked that those lawsuits be dismissed.
   In the San Antonio lawsuit, La Quinta charged that the
group's main goal is to "extort funds" from the partnership
by settling the matter in exchange for more than $500,000. It
also alleges that the group made "grand -- but false --
promises of substantial economic benefits to unitholders" if
it won control of La Quinta. Further, La Quinta said the
group doesn't have the financial ability or the management
experience to run the partnership.
   Mr. Nappo, a Stamford, Conn., lawyer, said the lawsuit is
"pretty much what we expected," given the group's effort to
change control of the company.
