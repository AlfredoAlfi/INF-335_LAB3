Goldman Creates
   Special Subsidiary
   For Derivatives

Goldman, currently the nation's most profitable investment
bank, set up its new unit specifically to trade warrants and
options on the Nikkei index of 225 large stocks that trade on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Merrill Lynch  Co. set up a similar unit late last year
to trade interest-rate swaps, currency swaps and other
derivative products. Not exactly stocks and not exactly
bonds, derivatives are hybrid securities that move in
relation to an underlying index, stock, bond, currency or
commodity.
   Yesterday, Standard  Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service Inc., two major credit-rating agencies, each assigned
a triple-A rating to the Goldman unit, called GS Financial
Products International L.P. That's better than the ratings on
Goldman's own long-term debt, which SP currently rates
single-A-plus.
   The triple-A rating is more important than ever these days
because the derivatives market has become increasingly
credit-sensitive. Swap dealers with triple-A ratings have a
big advantage in attracting customers over Wall Street
dealers with lower ratings. Many multinational companies
won't deal with a Wall Street firm with less than a double-A
rating.
   "If you have a low rating, you can't participate at all,"
said Mark Bachmann, an SP senior vice president. "The
highest rating is pretty valuable to do the business."
   Goldman's derivatives unit has assets of about $338
million, backed by about $70 million in capital, according to
Lisa Raiti, an SP vice president. Goldman declined to
comment on the new unit, citing securities-law constraints
involving new issues.
   The special units are also designed to ease concerns of
Wall Street's customers in the event a securities firm fails.
That's done by separating the unit's assets from those of its
parent.
