Pepper...and Salt
Football season ends at last;
   The stadiums sit in silence.
   We sadly search both print and tube
   For other forms of violence.

   The Best Is Last
                                                                                                       

   There are secrets to staying young,
   Such as never flying into a rage,
   Also being honest, eating slowly,
   And lying about your age.
   -- Bud Stiller.
