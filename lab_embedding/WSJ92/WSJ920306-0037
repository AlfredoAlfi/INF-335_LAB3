Skinner Attacks Mitchell
   Overe Partisan `Tactics'
Mr. Skinner complained to a small group of reporters that
House Democratic leaders had placed extraordinary pressure on
members to support the proposal over White House opposition.
He predicted that Mr. Mitchell -- who a day earlier had
attacked Mr. Bush for flip-flopping on taxes -- will use "the
same tactics" to round up votes in the Senate.
   "He's the most partisan majority leader we've had this
century," Mr. Skinner charged. "He makes Lyndon Johnson look
like a statesman . . . I can smell someone who puts politics
above his country."
   In a prepared statement, Sen. Mitchell responded by
accusing the White House of attempting to "divert attention
from the Bush administration's inaction on the economy."
Urging Mr. Bush to sign the Democratic tax package, he added,
"the American people want action, not name-calling."
