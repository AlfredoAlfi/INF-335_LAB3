International:
   Singapore's 1991 GDP Growth
The ministry blamed the lower growth figures on the
economic slowdown in industrial countries and effects of the
Persian Gulf War.
   Domestic demand increased 4.9%, down from 14% in 1990,
because of weaker growth in private investment and in private
and public consumption as well as a decline in stocks, the
ministry said. But public investment grew 21% in 1991,
compared with 11% in 1990.
   Inflation was moderate, as the consumer price index rose
3.4% from the previous year.
