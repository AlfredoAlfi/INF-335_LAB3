Letters to the Editor:
   We're In Only
   Partially Deep
In Massachusetts, our state's reputation as singularly
unfriendly to business has been altered dramatically by a new
administration that has made great strides to accommodate the
needs of business.
   Although commercial real estate in New England is indeed
battered by the current economic slump, our region is once
again an attractive business address.
