Business Brief -- Chesapeake Corp.:
   Quarterly Earnings Triple
   At Pulp and Paper Firm
The Richmond, Va., company attributed the gain in part to
price improvements in container-board products, packaging and
bleached hardwood market pulp. The industry as a whole has
suffered through much of 1991 from weak prices and flat
demand for paper products. Chesapeake said its three major
businesses all experienced volume increases in 1991, but
profitability was offset by lower prices through most of the
year.
