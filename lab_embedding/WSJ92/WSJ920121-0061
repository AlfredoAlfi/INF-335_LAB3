Ready-to-Serve Tea Market
   Draws Two More Entrants
The announcement comes as the ready-to-drink tea market,
with annual revenue of $400 million, is brimming with
activity. Friday, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co. and Nestle
S.A. introduced a single-serve tea drink, called Nestea Iced
Tea. Late last year, PepsiCo Inc. announced it was teaming up
with market-leader Thomas J. Lipton to develop tea-based
beverages.
   A potential hitch in the latest deal, however, was the
news yesterday that Nestle S.A. had launched a hostile bid
for Source Perrier S.A., the French parent of Perrier.
Although the bid is expected to touch off a heated battle for
control of the mineral-water company, Celestial Seasonings
officials said that for now, they were proceeding with their
plans.
   Company officials said the new line of teas will carry the
Celestial Seasonings brand, but will be bottled and
distributed in the U.S. by the Perrier unit. Based in
Boulder, Colo., Celestial Seasonings is a closely held
company that sells some 40 varieties of herbal teas.
   The new tea products are aimed at aging baby boomers, who
are increasingly seeking more healthful alternatives to
sodas.
