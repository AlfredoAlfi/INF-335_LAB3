States Pushed to Remove
   Illegal Billboards by U.S.
An estimated 92,000 signs were legal when they were
erected, but now violate spacing requirements, local zoning
laws or other restrictions and must be removed by the end of
1993, the agency said in a notice sent last Friday.
   An additional 22,000 signs, which were put up illegally,
must come down by June 18. The owners won't be compensated,
the agency said.
   All but four states have some illegal signs, led by
Wisconsin with 9,369, according to Sally Oldham, president of
Scenic America, a group opposed to billboards.
   States risk losing 10% of their federal highway funding if
they fail to remove illegal signs.
   The agency estimated that compensation to sign owners will
cost the government $428 million. States must pay 20% of the
cost, but that should take less than 2% of most states'
highway funds, said Federal Highway Administrator Tom Larson.
   Congress in 1978 barred states and local governments from
removing billboards without cash compensation.
