Farm Prices in February
   Rose 2.9% From January
Hog prices were up $4 to an average of $40.40 a
hundredweight, and barrows and gilts rose $3.70 to average
$41.20.
   Wheat prices rose 43 cents a bushel to $3.98. Corn rose
seven cents a bushel to $2.47.
   Tomato prices rose $18.90 to $59.40 a hundredweight, as
rainy Florida weather reduced supplies.
   Milk prices drifted lower as demand for cheese and other
manufactured products declined, finishing at $13.20 a
hundredweight, down 30 cents from January. Eggs, meanwhile,
dropped 5.3 cents from January, to an average of 43.3 cents a
dozen.
   The month's price index was 1.4% lower than a year
earlier. Lower prices for hogs, cattle and cotton were offset
partly by higher prices for wheat and milk.
