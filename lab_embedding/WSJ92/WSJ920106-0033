Occidental Petroleum
   Makes Oil Discovery
   In Northwest Oman
Finland's Neste Oy last year acquired a 35% stake in the
Suneinah concession, when Chevron Corp., San Francisco,
Calif., sold its Omani assets.
   Occidental of Oman Inc., the Omani branch of the Los
Angeles company, first discovered oil in 1983 at Safah in
western Oman close to the border with the United Arab
Emirates. More than 100 wells have been drilled since.
   The current total output at Safah is estimated at just
over 24,500 barrels per day, making it one of the country's
top producing fields. The new Occidental find is about 25
miles southeast of the Safah field.
   Oman produces more than 650,000 barrels a day of crude
oil, of which the majority is pumped by the state-controled
Petroleum Development Oman.
   Mr. Shanfari said Oman produced 242 million barrels of oil
in 1991. Discoveries last year totaled 342, raising the
country's estimated total proven reserves to 4.43 billion
barrels.
