Business Brief:
   May Department Stores and Affiliate
   Of Prudential to Dissolve Partnership
A spokesman for the retailer said the move, expected in
May, will allow each of the real estate companies "to pursue
its separate goals." He declined to elaborate. But industry
sources suggested that the partnership was being dissolved to
clear the way for another transaction, either a sale or a
shift in ownership of the two companies.
   May said it will recognize half of its deferred book gain
on the original transaction by taking an after-tax gain of
$125 million, or about 95 cents a share, in its fiscal second
quarter ending Aug. 1. The spokesman noted that it will be
"an accounting gain only, not a cash transaction."
   Indeed, the news had little effect on May's stock price.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
May shares rose 50 cents a share to close at $61.875.
   In last year's second quarter, May posted net income of
$82 million, or 62 cents a share on a primary basis.
   When the partnership was formed, it was widely viewed as a
way for May to establish a value for its real estate holdings
while making itself less vulnerable to a hostile takeover.
Melvin Simon  Associates Inc., a big mall developer based in
Indianapolis, initially owned part of the partnership too.
But industry sources said Simon was bought out within the
last two years by Prudential.
   Spokesmen for Simon and Prudential declined to comment.
