Trust Firm Ex-Head Sentenced
Central Mortgage was closed by Texas banking regulators in
June 1985 after an examination disclosed that the company was
insolvent. Mr. Signorelli claimed at the time and during his
trial that depositors' money was invested in
government-insured, mortgage-backed securities that weren't
understood by regulators.
