New Jersey Regulators
   Plan Closer Scrutiny
   Of Casino Finances
The Commission announced plans for a public hearing Feb. 3
on new standards to measure financial stability of casino
licensees. The rules would give casino officials and others a
better guide to required financial standards; in the past,
financial stability issues have been judged on a case-by-case
basis.
   Consultants who prepared the new criteria said all 12
casinos operating in Atlantic City are financially stable
under the proposed definition. But some "could still find
themselves facing serious -- and unacceptable -- financial
problems," Mr. Perskie said.
   New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment Act requires casinos to
invest the equivalent of 1.25% of gross gaming revenue in
development authority bonds or in projects approved by the
authority.
