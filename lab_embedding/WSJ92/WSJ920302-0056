Business Brief -- Long Island Lighting Co.:
   Utility Transfers Ownership
   In Deal to Close Reactor
The transfer took place after the federal Nuclear
Regulatory Commission sent a final order allowing the
transaction.
   Utility officials were eager to complete the transfer by
Saturday to avoid paying an additional $82 million in
property tax.
   The transfer was the culmination of an agreement fashioned
between the utility and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1989 in
which the utility agreed to sell the plant to the authority
for $1 in exchange for guaranteed rate increases of 5% for
each of the next 10 years. The plant, 60 miles east of
Manhattan, ran into heavy political opposition because of
fears that safe evacuation would be impossible in the event
of an accident.
