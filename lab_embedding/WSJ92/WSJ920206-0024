Business Brief -- Eastman Kodak Co.:
   Workers' Dividend Payouts
   To Be Cut for This Year
Kodak shares took a beating, after analyst reactions to
Kodak's lackluster 1991 earnings, including a
poorer-than-expected performance in the imaging and
information systems sectors. In late trading yesterday on the
New York Stock Exchange, the shares closed at $46.50, down
$4.25.
   For the fourth quarter, the Rochester, N.Y.-based
photographic, chemical and pharmaceutical concern reported a
net loss of $400 million, or $1.23 a share, after a $597
million restructuring charge. Sales were $5.1 billion.
