Business Brief -- Continental Bank Corp.:
   Earnings Rebound Predicted
   For 1992 After Loss in 1991
Reflecting last year's poor performance, none of the
bank's top five executives received bonuses, although Mr.
Theobald's salary rose by $83,333 to $583,333, according to
the company's proxy statement. Last year Mr. Theobald earned
$890,000 in salary and bonus. The top executives, however,
did receive stock options issued at a price of $11.44 a
share. Mr. Theobald received options to purchase 146,000
shares.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Continental shares were quoted at $16, up 50 cents.
   Continental also said in the proxy statement that it will
pay S. Waite Rawls III, a former vice chairman who left the
bank last fall, full salary and benefits through April 1993
unless he finds employment. The bank didn't disclose Mr.
Rawls's 1991 salary, but in 1990 he received $350,000.
