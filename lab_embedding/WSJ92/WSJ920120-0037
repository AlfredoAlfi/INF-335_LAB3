Business Brief -- Brendle's Inc.:
   Retailer Says It Will Take
   Charge Against 4th Quarter
The company will also eliminate 65 out of 377 jobs at its
headquarters and distribution center. Six of the
lowest-performing stores will be closed.
   The changes will result in a $2.31-a-share charge in the
fourth quarter ending Feb. 2. Mr. Brendle said these actions
will reduce its $36.5 million debt by $6 million.
   "We're trying to regroup the company and better define the
niche we hope to fill," Mr. Brendle said.
   For its first three quarters, Brendle's reported a loss of
$1.76 a share compared with a loss of 90 cents the year
earlier, on sales of $169 million in each year.
