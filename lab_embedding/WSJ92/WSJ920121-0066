Japan Is Raising Penalties
   For Securities Violations
The new rules will be incorporated in a revised securities
and exchange law to be submitted by the ministry to the
regular session of the Diet, or parliament, opening in early
February, the officials said.
   The officials said the ministry decided on the sharp
increase in penalties in consultation with the Justice
Ministry, in line with a Legislative Council review of
preventive measures against economic crimes. The Legislative
Council is an advisory organ to the justice minister.
   Maximum penalties against insider trading or stock trading
on secret information will be raised to 50 million yen from
500,000 yen, the officials said.
   Penalties against individual violators will remain
unchanged, they said.
