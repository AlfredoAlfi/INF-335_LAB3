Program to Honor Schools
   Receives Needed Funds
In a statement, Education Secretary Lamar Alexander said
he is taking $885,000 from a $100 million school-improvement
account to continue the recognition program. Because of the
delay in securing funds, he said, the awards ceremony for
this year's winners won't be held until early 1993.
