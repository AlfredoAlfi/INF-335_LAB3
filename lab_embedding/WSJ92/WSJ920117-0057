Business Brief -- Tandy Corp.:
   Earnings Decline of 20%
   Seen for Dec. 31 Quarter
Tandy said the quarter was hurt by costs associated with
new stores and by lower-than-expected profit margins in
personal computers, partly because of a surge in low-margin
sales late in December.
   Separately, the manufacturer and retailer of personal
computers and electronic products said it is preparing to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
underwritten offering of about $400 million of preferred
equity redemption cumulative stock. These so-called Percs
give holders a regular dividend and the chance to benefit
from an increase in the common stock price. But the potential
appreciation is limited because the issuer can redeem the
stock at any time at a preset price. The shares automatically
convert into Tandy common shares after three years.
   The company said proceeds will be used to fund future
purchases of the company's common stock.
