Invesco Chosen to Manage
   Some of Japan Firm's Assets
The funds entrusted to Invesco under the deal represent a
tiny sliver of the 25.6 trillion yen in total Japanese
employee pension assets for which investment management firms
are allowed to compete. It's also only a fraction of
Nagasakiya's 23.7 billion yen total employee pension assets.
   Still, the contract may mark the beginning of much wider
participation by foreign firms in what hitherto has been one
of the most carefully sheltered -- and potentially profitable
-- corners of Japan's giant financial-services market.
   Until recently, the business of managing Japan's vast pool
of pension fund capital has been the exclusive preserve of
the nation's huge trust companies and life insurers. But
assets managed by those domestic institutions have earned
dismal returns by international standards, and foreigners
have long alleged they could do the job better if given the
chance.
