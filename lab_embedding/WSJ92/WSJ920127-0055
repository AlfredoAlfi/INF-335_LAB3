Business Brief -- Kruger Inc.:
   Newsprint Machine Is Closed
   Until at Least End of Year
The closely held pulp and paper concern also said its
Corner Brook, Newfoundland, mill will close a newsprint
machine Feb. 9 for at least one month, reducing the output
there by at least 6,000 metric tons this year. The company
added that short-term shutdowns at its mills in
Trois-Rivieres and Bromptonville, Quebec, have reduced
newsprint production by 5,000 metric tons since the beginning
of the year.
   Kruger said adverse market conditions will probably force
it to further reduce newsprint production during the year.
