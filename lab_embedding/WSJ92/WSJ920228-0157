Northern Telecom's
   U.S. Unit Settles Suit
   Brought by the CWA
A spokeswoman at Northern said the payment wasn't an
admission by the company that it had spied on its employees.
"One person instigated this activity," she said, declining to
identify the individual, who is no longer employed by the
company. "And five or fewer were involved and the others had
no reason to suspect their activities weren't authorized."
Management, she added, had no knowledge of the activity.
   "This was an attempt to get rid of the union," said a
spokeswoman for the CWA. "If you look at the union
decertifications we've suffered at Northern Telecom over the
years it's symptomatic of a corporate policy."
   The suit, filed in Sept. 1990, charged that Northern, the
U.S. unit of Toronto-based Northern Telecom Ltd., wiretapped
conversations of employees at the plant from 1976 to 1989 to
stymie the union's organizing attempts.
   In 1981 the CWA started an organizing drive at the plant
but failed to get a contract despite 45 bargaining sessions
with the company, the union said. In 1982 the company got its
workers to decertify the union and no further attempts at
organizing were made.
   On Jan. 30, Northern Telecom said it would ban electronic
monitoring of employees without their knowledge.
