   Proposes High-Speed,
   Data Service Plans
Bellcore, a consortium of the Bell telephone companies,
said the plan is designed to help manufacturers build
equipment that is compatible with SMDS networks. Frank
Gratzer, executive director of the Bellcore project, said the
phone companies estimate that exchange SMDS will be offered
in about 30 U.S. cities by the early part of 1993. The
proposed requirements will make it possible for corporations
and other organizations to interconnect those cities and to
expand use of the data service nationally and
internationally.
   Bellcore provides research and technical support to
Ameritech Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp., BellSouth Corp., Nynex
Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Southwestern Bell Corp., and U
S WEST Inc., as well as Cincinnati Bell Telephone and
Southern New England Telephone Co.
