Business Brief -- General Motors Corp.:
   Auto Maker Plans to Cut
   Prices on `Collision Parts'
"Some insurance companies exert considerable pressure on
dealers and body shops to use lower-cost imitation parts
because the decision has already been made as to what they
will pay for a repair to a given make and model vehicle,"
said an executive of GM Service Parts Operations.
   In the past, GM and other manufacturers have argued that
the imitation parts don't have the same fit and ability to
resist corrosion as parts from the original manufacturer. The
imitation-parts makers, however, have argued that the only
difference is the price.
