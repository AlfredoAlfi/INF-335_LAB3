   Plan to Limit Prices
   Of Prescription Drugs
The discounts will apply to outpatient prescription drugs
purchased directly by the clinics for people not covered by
Medicaid, but not to programs that already receive Glaxo
discounts. The company estimated that the discounts on the
products would save the clinics a combined $10 million a
year.
   The Glaxo unit, which is based in Research Triangle Park,
N.C., also pledged to keep price increases in line with the
general inflation rate.
   ICI Pharmaceuticals Group, a Wilmington, Del., unit of
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of Britain, said it would
limit 1992 price adjustments to the rate of inflation for all
products to the general public. The company said the maximum
price increase would be 4.1%. A spokesman said the company
already has an assistance program for people who can show
they're unable to pay for needed drugs.
   Last month, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., New York, which
raised its prescription drug prices twice last year, said it
would give away its heart drugs to patients who couldn't
afford them. And Merck  Co., Rahway, N.J., said it would
reduce the cost of prescription drugs it sells to certain
federally funded health centers for the poor.
