GSA Board Affirms
   U.S. Army's Award
   Of Contract to Boeing
In its decision, the General Services Administration board
of contract appeals concluded that the Boeing bid was the
best value over the life of the system. While concluding that
the Boeing bid is 5.3% higher than the Computer Sciences bid,
the agency said that it was technically superior and would
thus result in greater personnel efficiencies and avoidance
of future upgrades.
   A spokesman for Computer Sciences, El Segundo, Calif.,
said the company was reviewing the decision but had no plans
to appeal it. "We don't see taking this any further," says
William Lackey, manager of investor relations. Meanwhile, a
Boeing spokesman said the company would proceed on aspects of
the project that had come to a halt because of the protest.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Computer Sciences shares closed at $77.75 a share, down 50
cents, and Boeing finished at $48.125, up 75 cents.
