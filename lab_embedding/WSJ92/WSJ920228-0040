   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Sales rose 8.1% to 78.3 billion kronor from 72.4 billion
kronor.
   In its forecast for 1992, the group said market trends in
the first part of the year "give no promise of an early
recovery in Statoil's principal markets."
   It said stronger economic growth in the U.S. and Western
Europe will be needed "to establish a market basis for an
output by OPEC {the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries} in excess of 23 million to 24 million barrels of
oil per day in 1992." Under such market conditions, Statoil
said, it will give continued emphasis to improved
cost-effectiveness.
   Operating profit at Statoil's refining and marketing unit
tumbled to 647 million kroner in the year from 1.2 billion
kroner in 1990. Statoil blamed the plunge on storage loss
caused by lower crude and product prices, a longer and more
comprehensive turnaround than planned at the Mongstad
refinery, and investments related to the brand change to
Statoil Norge from Norol.
   The petrochemicals and plastics unit's results slipped to
a 17 million krona operating loss in 1991 from a 718 million
krona profit in 1990, it said.
   At the end of 1991, Statoil had 13,950 employees, up from
13,000 a year earlier.
