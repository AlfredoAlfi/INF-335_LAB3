Who's News:
   Finnish Company,
   In a Surprise Move,
   Names Ollila President
In making the appointment, Nokia directors bypassed Kalle
Isokallio, the company's previous president and Mr.
Vuorilehto's heir-apparent. Mr. Isokallio, a 41-year-old
computer executive, then immediately resigned.
   The news sent Nokia's stock tumbling on international
markets. The company's "free preference stock," the class of
equity most traded internationally, skidded six Finnish
markkaa, or roughly 10%, in early trading though it later
recouped much of the decline, closing at 60 markkaa ($13.54),
down 2.5 markkaa on the day.
   Analysts said some investors feared that a major corporate
problem might have caused Mr. Isokallio's sudden departure.
Nokia's fortunes have dimmed in recent years as an expansion
strategy went sour. Nokia officials, however, dismissed
suggestions that any corporate skeletons were connected with
the management succession.
