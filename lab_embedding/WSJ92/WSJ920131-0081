Senate Committee Clears
   Extension of Jobless Aid
The bill is identical to a measure approved this week by
the House Ways and Means Committee. If enacted, the
legislation would allow unemployed workers who have exhausted
state aid to qualify for a total of 52 or 59 weeks of
benefits, depending on the level of unemployment in each
state.
   Most of the bill's cost would be paid for by dipping into
$2.2 billion in unexpected revenue raised last year by
Congress. The $500 million balance would come from raising
the estimated quarterly tax paid by corporations. Congress
last fall financed jobless benefits in part by stepping up
collection of the corporate estimated tax.
