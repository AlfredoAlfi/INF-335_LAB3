Investment Company
   For Small Firms Quits
   Bankruptcy Protection
First Connecticut also agreed to relinquish its SBA
investment-company license. Shareholders will retain their
interest, and the company will repay unsecured creditors in
full plus any interest owed.
   The plan also changes the rights of private investors --
who had been able to put their loan participations on short
notice -- converting the $27.5 million in demand obligations
to a five-year term loan paying interest at 12%. First
Connecticut had attributed a spurt of such requests, sparked
by declining real estate values, for forcing it into Chapter
11 proceedings in August 1990.
   First Connecticut will continue operating, but as a much
smaller entity. Attorneys for the company said that after the
debts are paid, the company expects to have $12 million left
in shareholder equity. They said First Connecticut won't make
any new loans for the next two years, other than financing
the purchase of properties it acquired through foreclosure or
otherwise. When it filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, it reported $70 million in assets
and $60 million in liabilities.
