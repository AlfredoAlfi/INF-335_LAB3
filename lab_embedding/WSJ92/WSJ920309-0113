Grace Energy Shareholders Suits
The parent has said it intends to sell nonstrategic
businesses including Grace Energy, and that buying the
remaining shares would give it flexibility in divesting
itself of the business.
   The lawsuits seek to enjoin the offer or to rescind it, if
it has already taken place when a court rules on the request.
   In Boca Raton, Fla., a spokesman for W. R. Grace confirmed
the two lawsuits, but said the complaints are without merit.
