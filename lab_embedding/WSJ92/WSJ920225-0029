New York Merc Seeks to Run
   Pollution-Permit Marks
Utilities will be allowed to buy and sell these allowances
like commodities. For example, a company with low-grade
sulfur dioxide emissions wouldn't need the government
allowances and could make a profit by selling them to a
company that did.
   The Clean Air Act amendments call for an annual public
auction and a cash market in the pollution allowances.
Yesterday, the New York exchange -- commonly called NYMEX and
best-known for the large petroleum futures and options
contracts traded there -- became the second futures market to
apply to run these markets.
   The Chicago Board of Trade has also submitted a proposal
to the EPA and has applied for permission from the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to trade futures contracts based
on the allowances. Nymex hasn't applied to trade a futures
contract; a spokeswoman said the exchange sees development of
a futures contract as "evolutionary."
   The Nymex proposal contends that the exchange's experience
with highly volatile energy markets would be an advantage in
administering the EPA allowance trading program.
