Technology Brief -- Siemens AG:
   Firm Confers With Toshiba
   On Joint Chip Production
Under the proposal, Siemens would deliver German-made
semiconductor masters to Toshiba in Japan, which would finish
them in a silicon foundry process there before a final
assembly in Germany.
   Toshiba already has a similar silicon foundry project
going with Motorola Inc. of the U.S., the Siemens spokesman
noted.
