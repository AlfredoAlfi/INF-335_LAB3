Agency to Resume Buying
   Spot Oil for U.S. Reserve
A spokesman said the department has $671.3 million
available for buying oil, including proceeds from the sales
and funds that were appropriated but never spent in earlier
years. Prices for the light crude oil the department wants to
buy have fallen below $19 a barrel.
   The department said the oil will be acquired by the
Defense Fuel Supply Center, the Defense Department's
oil-purchasing arm. An open solicitation will be issued under
which offers from oil suppliers will be received every two
weeks.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins said the department will
continue to explore leasing oil or other alternative
acquisition options for filling the reserve. Currently, the
petroleum reserve holds slightly more than 568 million
barrels of crude in salt caverns along the Gulf Coast in
Texas and Louisiana.
