Technology Brief -- Mobile Telecommunications:
   Loss of Up to $5.5 Million
   To Be Posted for Quarter
Mr. Fugate says MTEL will probably release its
fourth-quarter and year-end results tomorrow or Thursday.
   Mr. Fugate said the Jackson, Miss., company, which
provides nationwide and international paging services, had
positive cash flow -- earnings before taxes, interest and
depreciation -- of $2.5 million to $3 million in 1991 and
expects to reach profitability in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was between $24 million and $25
million, Mr. Fugate said, compared with $19.9 million in the
year-ago period. For the year, revenue was $90 million to $91
million, compared with $66.3 million in 1990.
   BellSouth Corp.'s MobileComm unit began offering
nationwide paging service in competition with MTEL last fall,
but MTEL officials said that because 98% of the potential
market is untapped, MTEL hasn't lost customers.
