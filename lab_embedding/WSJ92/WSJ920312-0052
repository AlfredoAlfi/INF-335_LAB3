International Brief -- Bayer AG:
   Firm's '91 Profit Fell 2.6%
   But Dividend Isn't Changed
Bayer's profit decline was much smaller than those
announced earlier this week by Germany's two largest chemical
groups, BASF AG and Hoechst AG. Both of those companies
trimmed their dividends to 12 marks a share.
   Because the three chemical giants have paid out identical
13-mark dividends since 1983, some investors worried whether
Bayer might trim its dividend, too. Ahead of Bayer's
announcement, the company's share price slid to 291.50 marks
from Tuesday's close of 295.20 marks. But after the news, the
price rebounded to close at 294 marks, down 1.20 marks for
the day.
   Bayer's results were closely in line with expectations and
reflected the company's strong representation in
pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, which made it less
vulnerable to the cyclical downturn in basic chemicals.
