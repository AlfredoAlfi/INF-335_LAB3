Pepper...and Salt
("Tests show execs waste time . . ." -- Survey)
                                                                                                       

   It might not be so bad to hear
   This charge that pollsters make,
   If only they'd give credit for
   The time the surveys take.

   It's got to be all or nothing today --
   You simply can't play it just halfway;
   The middle course being out of style,
   You've got to be either a "phobe" or a "phile."
   -- George O. Ludcke.
