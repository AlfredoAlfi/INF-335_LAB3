Hazards in such confined spaces include asphyxiation,
engulfment by materials, entrapment, burn explosion injuries,
electrical shock and exposure to toxic materials, as well as

standard for general industry.
   The public has 60 days to file comments. After that time,
the agency will decide whether to formally propose new
confined-space rules.
