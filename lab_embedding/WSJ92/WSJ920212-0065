   Holding Company for Iberia
   Expected to Clear Infusion
The very size of Iberia's request is certain to raise
eyebrows. And with losses for 1991 expected to total about 50
billion pesetas, Iberia is worried about the commission's
reaction. "We are not seeking money to cover losses," said an
Iberia spokeswoman. "We want it in order to prepare for what
comes after 1993."
   Iberia wants to staunch losses, increase its productivity
and cut back on its costs. Its plan calls for trimming its
work force by 10%, or 3,000 jobs, improve the use of its
fleet, offer a wider range of services, and expand throughout
Latin America.
