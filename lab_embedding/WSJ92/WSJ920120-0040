International Brief -- Grand Metropolitan PLC:
   Concern Plans to Sell Stake
   In Remy Martin, Cointreau
But a spokeswoman for the affiliates in Paris said the
price was 1.136 billion francs ($205.8 million).
   George Bull, chairman of Grand Met's wine and spirits
unit, said the two stakes, acquired in 1990, were sold
because they didn't lead to the broad synergies that had been
hoped for.
