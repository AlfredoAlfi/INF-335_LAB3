Business Brief:
   Troubled Healthcare
   International Plans
   To Buy HealthVest
Healthcare is proposing to pay $3.25 a share for each of
HealthVest's 10.8 million shares outstanding. That's well
below offers of $6 and $4.50 a share that another company
made for HealthVest last year; those offers fell through
after the acquirer's earnings declined and HealthVest failed
to respond to the offer.
   Healthcare said that HealthVest hasn't agreed to be
acquired nor has it approved the proposed plan, which is
subject to court and creditor approval. Healthcare's plan
didn't say whether it would assume or try to repay
HealthVest's approximately $235 million in debt.
   Under the plan, Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc., a
large Healthcare shareholder that also is owed about $9
million in secured debt, would own about 60% of the
reorganized company's 10 million shares outstanding. The
subordinated debentures holders would receive about 15% of
the company's stock, as would other unsecured creditors.
Preferred shareholders would receive 6% of the stock and
current common holders would receive 4%.
   Greenery, a Newton, Mass., operator of nursing homes and
rehabilitation centers, would arrange for or provide the
financing needed under the plan.
