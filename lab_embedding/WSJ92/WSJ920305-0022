Law:
   RTC Paid $251.5 Million
   To Law Firms During 1991
Cravath was retained by the RTC and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. in September 1990 to help recoup losses
incurred by thrifts and banks that traded in junk bonds with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Michael Milken, the former
head of Drexel's junk-bond operations.
   Last week, lawyers for Drexel said Mr. Milken agreed to
pay $500 million to settle the agencies' claims, which could
trigger a "bonus" provision in Cravath's retainer agreement
with the regulators. The provision allows the firm to seek an
additional $20 million from the agencies for any collections
over $200 million in the Drexel and Milken cases.
   Morrison  Hecker, through a branch office in Phoenix,
Ariz., is pursuing claims arising from the failure of Lincoln
Savings  Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. An RTC spokeswoman
said settlements obtained by the law firm accounted for most
of the $109.1 million in cash and settlements that the agency
received last year from former officers, directors and
professional advisers at failed thrifts.
