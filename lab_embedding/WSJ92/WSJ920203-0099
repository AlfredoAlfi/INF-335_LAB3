Letters to the Editor:
   JFK and Bobby Killed
   For the Same Reason?
One murder of one Kennedy might possibly have been done by
a lone gunman. But two lone gunmen going after two different
Kennedys in the same historical context stretches the
credibility of the lone-gunman theory to the point of the
ridiculous. Was the second assassination a coincidence? And
why is it never discussed in connection with the killing of
JFK? Is the truth just too terrible to contemplate?
