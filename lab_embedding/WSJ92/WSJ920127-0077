Bill Is Introduced to Alter
   Hong Kong Share Trading
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Expected to be implemented this year, the system would be
the final major change to be put into place that was
recommended by a study into overhauling Hong Kong's financial
markets after the 1987 crash. The move requires legislation
because it would alter the way shareholdings are recorded,
substituting a centralized set of accounts for share
certificates, and would inject the settlement system as a
third party between buyers and sellers in each securities
transaction. A change in bankruptcy rules is also required to
protect the clearing system if one party in a trade goes
under.
   Before being implemented, the system must be approved by
the local securities watchdog, the Securities and Futures
Commission, which has expressed recent concern about the
system's current leadership. Further refinements are needed
in the area of managing risk, Mr. Nendick said.
   The settlement mechanism is considered a vital step toward
the market's ultimate goal of establishing computerized
matched trading, which analysts believe won't be available
until 1993.
