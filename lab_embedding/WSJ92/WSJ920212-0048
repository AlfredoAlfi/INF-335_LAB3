RTC Seeks to Recover
   $1.1 Billion by Suing
   Failed Thrifts' Officers
Regulators seized both thrifts in 1989 and turned them
over to the RTC, the agency responsible for cleaning up the
thrift debacle. The suits allege government losses in excess
of $1.1 billion at First Federal and $50 million at Savers
Federal.
   Among the First Federal defendants are former chief
executive officers Marion R. Godwin and H. Charles Johnston.
Among the Savers Federal defendants are former chief
executive Frederick Cobb and directors J.W. Benafield, a
former mayor of Little Rock, and Joseph B. Hurst, a former
member of the city's Board of Directors.
