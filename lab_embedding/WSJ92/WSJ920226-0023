   Concern Will Buy
   Assets in Africa From BP
The disinvestment by BP is in line with the group's
strategy "to focus its resources on selected strategic
markets," the company said. BP has said recently that it
intends to focus future operations on three core areas:
exploration and production, refining and marketing and
chemicals.
   For Elf, the acquisition reinforces the French
state-controlled company's downstream operations, which have
tended to concentrate on petrochemicals, and reaffirms Elf's
ambition to improve the balance between its exploration
activities and its refining businesses. Elf Aquitaine has a
long history in West Africa, but so far the group has been
active mainly in exploration and production. In addition to
the refining operations, the African acquisition includes 650
service stations.
   It is the second time in two years that Elf has acquired
assets from BP. In March 1990, the French group acquired the
British company's upstream exploration assets for an
estimated 645 million francs ($114.8 million at current
rates).
