   The Capital-Gains Tax
   And Divine Inspiration
In contrast, with any accelerated depreciation (i.e.,
expensing), the tax shield offered by the depreciation is
front-loaded and will not be eroded as much by inflation.
This brings us to the final issue. For the homeowner and the
long-term investor, indexation can bring better relief and
provide higher incentives to produce and invest than the
proposed reduction in the capital-gains tax rate: 15% is fine
but indexing is divine.
