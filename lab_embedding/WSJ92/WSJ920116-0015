Business Brief -- Baroid Corp.:
   Charge of $8 Million Is Set
   In Quarter for Revamping
Included in the charge is the cost of reducing the
company's domestic work force by 10% to 15%, which should be
completed this week, said Mr. Hutcheson. Currently, Baroid
employs about 2,200 people domestically, he said. For the
1990 fourth quarter, Baroid reported earnings of $13.1
million on sales of $176.8 million.
   The majority of the charge, however, is associated with
the closing of three drilling fluid facilities in West Texas
and Oklahoma, said Mr. Hutcheson. "The activity level in this
area has been very low and we expect the depressed market
conditions to continue beyond 1992," he said.
   The company said the final part of the charge is the
write-down of certain domestic heavy manufacturing equipment
inventories.
