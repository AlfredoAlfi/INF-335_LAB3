EIE International
   Buys Remaining 70%
   Of Regent Hotel Chain
EIE last month indicated that it would exercise its option
as a minority shareholder to buy Mr. Burns's 65%. The
decision blocked a rival offer, reportedly for $95 million,
made by Wharf (Holdings) Ltd., a Hong Kong company with
interests in hotels, real estate and transportation. EIE had
until late last week to match Wharf's offer, which Mr. Burns
conditionally accepted last October.
   Mr. Burns, a co-founder of the 14-unit luxury-hotel chain,
said he will stay on as chairman and chief executive. EIE is
a major owner of Regent properties. But because of its huge
debt burden and the poor state of the property market
world-wide, the Japanese company is believed to be searching
for partners to participate in the Regent management company
and in the equity of properties it owns. Indeed, it asked
Wharf to become a 50% partner in its Regent property
portfolio for $370 million but was turned down. EIE officials
weren't available for comment.
