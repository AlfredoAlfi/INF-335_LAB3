Technology Brief -- Abbott Laboratories:
   FDA Gives Approval to Sell
   Test for Both AIDS Strains
In comparison to the more widespread HIV-1 AIDS strain for
which blood banks have been testing since 1985, HIV-2 is
currently an extremely rare form of the disease in this
country.
   Last autumn, however, an advisory panel for the FDA
recommended that the nation's blood banks begin testing for
HIV-2 by June of this year.
   A number of companies make tests to find the antibodies
for HIV-1. But until Abbott got the FDA's nod, the only
company currently cleared to market a test for HIV-2, or a
simultaneous test for both strains -- which is the most
logical and attractive format for blood agencies -- has been
Genetic Systems Corp., a Seattle unit of France's Elf
Aquitaine.
   Abbott said its combination assays are currently available
in "a number of countries" outside the U.S.
