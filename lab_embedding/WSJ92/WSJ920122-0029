Merger Activity Last Year
   At Lowest Level Since 1963
The declines came with deals of all sizes, although
activity in the largest deals fell the most, with the value
of 1991's biggest 15 transactions totaling half that of 1990.
Activity in the under $50 million segment was off 18%. Deals
valued at over $100 million fell 16% while the number of
deals valued at over $1 billion dropped 38% to 13.
   Like the year before, divestitures accounted for 45% of
announced transactions, as companies continued to sell off
unrelated or unprofitable units.
   Merger and acquisition activity grew in the banking and
finance fields. While the number of transactions slipped to
165 from 178, their total value surged to $20.4 billion from
$4.6 billion.
   Foreign activity has also slowed considerably. Four of the
largest 15 deals involved the purchase of U.S. entities by
foreign corporations. But the total number of foreign buyers
dropped 29% to 188 from 264, while the total value bid for
those deals where a purchase price was disclosed dropped 63%
to $12.3 billion from $32.8 billion a year earlier.
