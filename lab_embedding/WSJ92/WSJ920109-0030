Business Brief -- Medtronic Inc.:
   FDA Panel Plans to Review
   New Defibrillator Product
Medtronic, which last year had $1 billion in revenue,
estimates it could reach $100 million in sales with the PCD
in its first year on the market. It estimates the world-wide
market for such a device could reach $700 million within five
years.
   Medtronic, known primarily as a pacemaker company since
roughly half its revenue comes from that device, was freed to
enter the defibrillator market when it settled patent
litigation last year with Eli Lilly  Co. Lilly already sells
a defibrillator.
   Medtronic's device would be more advanced. It will be able
to stop rapid heartbeats with low-level electric shocks
barely perceptible to a patient. The debrillator already on
the market has a more powerful electric shock. Lilly, too, is
pursuing a more advanced device with several levels of
electrical shock.
