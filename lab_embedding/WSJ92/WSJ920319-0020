International:
   Bundesbank Urges Cuts
   In Aid to Eastern Germany
The central bank cautioned that borrowing to fund costs of
this magnitude "would increase interest payments so sharply
that fiscal flexibility would be lost and tax increases will
need to be made, which would worsen the overall economy." It
said the heavy government borrowing to fund rising aid costs
has already raised German interest rates. And while the
effect on inflation has been limited, inflationary pressures
are building, the Bundesbank said.
   The Bundesbank warning comes amid waning business
confidence as western Germany's stagnating economy drifts
dangerously close to recession. Private spending is sluggish
and industry investment is slowing.
   The stability-conscious Bundesbank has been pressing the
government to reduce its annual bill for unification. "The
successive reduction of new borrowing by limiting
expenditures is urgently needed," the bank declared.
