House Democratic Leaders
   Back Aspin's Defense Cuts
Praising Rep. Aspin's effort as a "responsible and
well-schooled approach" for shaping a post-Cold War military,
House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington told reporters: "I
think it will definitely be part of our budget next week. I
support his position."
   The package has a good chance of getting through the House
without major surgery, despite anticipated stiff opposition
from liberal and conservative factions. But so far, Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia and
other Senate Democratic leaders have declined to endorse any
of the specifics in Rep. Aspin's package.
