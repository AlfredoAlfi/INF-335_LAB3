Business Brief:
   Coca-Cola Is Poised
   To Re-Enter India
   With Joint Venture
Under the complex ownership arrangement, Britco is
66%-owned by Jmrpco Ltd., which was formed in 1991 as an
offshore investment vehicle to develop business operations in
India. Jmrpco, in turn, is 60%-owned by J.M. Rajan Pillai, an
Indian entrepreneur living in Singapore, and 40%-owned by
Coca-Cola South Asia Holdings Inc., a unit of Coca-Cola.
Britannia Industries Ltd., a publicly held company based in
Calcutta, will own 24% of Britco.
   Coca-Cola left India in 1977 when the government sought
access to its secret soft-drink formula.
   Separately, the company said it increased its share of the
international soft-drink market to 44% last year from 43% in
1990. The figures, in a break from past reporting practice,
include results from the former Soviet Union and China.
   Coca-Cola decided to include those countries because the
company's investments there have increased, and the change
"more accurately reflects the potential for world-wide
growth," a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said. The company has made
deeper inroads into the former Soviet Union in recent months,
trying to capitalize on the expansion of consumer markets.
   The company also reported that its U.S. market share rose
slightly last year, to 41% from 40.7% in 1990.
