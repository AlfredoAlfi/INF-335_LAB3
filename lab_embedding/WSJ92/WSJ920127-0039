Business Brief -- Triangle Wire  Cable Inc.:
   New Company Is Formed
   By Merging Four Concerns
Messrs. Peltz and May are best known for having made big
profits in the 1980s by buying large stakes in several
can-making companies, combining them into Triangle
Industries. They later sold the can-making business to
Pechiney S.A. of France for $1.26 billion but retained
control of the wire and cable business. The two men currently
invest through Trian Group.
   Triangle Wire  Cable, with William R. Pollert as
chairman, plans to makes "significant investment" in its
Florence, Ala., plant to triple capacity while closing plants
in Edison and in Bennington, Vt., which together employ 325
workers. The closings are expected in the second quarter,
leaving Triangle Wire  Cable with six plants. The company
said it expects this year's sales to total almost $500
million. Triangle PWC's sales were about half that last year,
the spokesman said.
   The new company plans to set up its headquarters in
Pawtucket.
