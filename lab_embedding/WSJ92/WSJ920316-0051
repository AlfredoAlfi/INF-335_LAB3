Business Brief -- Tulip Computers N.V.:
   Dutch Company Sees Sales
   Improving Slightly in 1992
Mr. Nederveen said Tulip, one of Europe's few remaining
small, independent computer makers, has escaped the worst of
the market's malaise by focusing on a broad range of
information technology "building blocks." The company
specializes in providing total office systems, including pre-
and post-sale support.
   While the current downturn in Europe's major
industrialized economies has led to a slowdown in capital
goods spending by big companies, Europe still has a huge
potential, said Mr. Nederveen. Tulip and other computer
companies estimate a 25% to 30% gap between computers in
place and eventual needs.
