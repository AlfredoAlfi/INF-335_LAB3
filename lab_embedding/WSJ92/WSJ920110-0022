Business Brief -- General Cinema Corp.:
   Company Agrees to Settle
   Complaint on Acquisition
Federal law requires that companies that plan to acquire,
for noninvestment purposes, assets of $15 million or more of
another company must inform the commission, which reviews the
plan for possible antitrust law violations.
   Peter Farwell, a vice president at General Cinema,
contends the Newton, Mass., specialty retailer, theater and
publishing concern bought the $135 million stake for
investment purposes only. But the commission disagreed,
charging that General Cinema was "considering ways to
participate in . . . the basic business decisions of
Cadbury." Cadbury is a British soft-drink and confectionery
product concern.
   Mr. Farwell said that while not admitting guilt, the
company agreed to the settlement to avoid the cost of
litigation.
