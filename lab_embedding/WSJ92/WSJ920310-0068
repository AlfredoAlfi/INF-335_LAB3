Technology Brief-- WordStar International Inc.:
   Negotiations With Delrina
   Focus on Possible Merger
Delrina's products, including software to handle facsimile
transmissions and to generate forms, would compliment
WordStar's main product, a word-processing program for
personal computers, Mr. Russian said. A merger between the
companies "would be a strategic fit because of our product
lines," he said.
