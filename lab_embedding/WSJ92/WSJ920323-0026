The thrift, which has assets of nearly $40 billion, has
been pursuing an aggressive strategy of building a retail
deposit base in Florida. Since mid-1990 it has amassed $9.2
billion in deposits in the region. It operates 196 retail
bank branches, 25 consumer finance offices and 16 residential

1990 when it purchased 71 branches of CenTrust Savings Bank,
Miami, with $2.1 billion in deposits.
