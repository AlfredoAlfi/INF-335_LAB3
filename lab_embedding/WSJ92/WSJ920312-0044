New York State Rules
   Against Delta in Cases
   Of Ex-Pan Am Staff
The agency said it had determined that there was probable
cause to believe that in interviewing former Pan Am
employees, Delta made unlawful inquiries.
   The complaints allege that Delta asked questions about
marital status, sexual activity and birth-control practices.
   A New York City human rights agency in mid-February filed
about 50 similar complaints. A state spokeswoman said
employees can't file the same complaints with both agencies.
   Delta, which attributed the complaints to disappointment
by former Pan Am employees that they weren't hired, has
denied asking discriminatory questions.
