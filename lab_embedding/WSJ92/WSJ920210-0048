Bank Withdrawals Fueled
   1991 Mutual Fund Growth
"Individual investors not only returned to equity mutual
funds, but they bought unprecedented amounts of `bond and
income' mutual funds as well," said Jeffrey Schaefer, the
securities association's research chief.
   From December 1990 through December 1991, assets of
money-market mutual funds grew slightly more than 8%,
compared with a surge of nearly 37% in bond and income funds,
and 49% in stock funds, he said.
   Indeed, 1991 was the first year since 1987 in which the
increase in assets of both stock-and-bond and income funds
exceeded that of money-market funds, Mr. Schaefer said.
   Another sign of individual investors' return to the
markets in 1991: Trading by individual investors on the New
York Stock Exchange jumped 19% last year; trading by
institutions rose by only half that level, or 9%, the
association said.
