Business Brief -- Syntex Corp.:
   Pharmaceutical Concern Says
   Sales, Profit Climbed 20%
Shares of Syntex rose 87.5 cents to $48.875 yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange. The company attributed its solid
performance to a combination of strong demand for its
products and special promotions, which Syntex said "moved
some sales into the second quarter that would have otherwise
occurred in the third quarter." Because of this shift, Syntex
said that it is "no longer sure" that its earnings, in
absolute dollar terms, in the second half of the year will be
"stronger than the first half."
   In the first six months, net rose 12% to $253.9 million,
or $1.13 a share, on revenue of $1.04 billion, from $226.7
million, or $1.01 a share, on revenue of $898.7 million a
year ago.
