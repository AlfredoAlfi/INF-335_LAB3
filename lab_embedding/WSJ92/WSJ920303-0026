International Brief -- Source Perrier S.A.:
   EC Panel Clears Agnelli
   To Advance Takeover Bid
Exor is one of the targets in a tangled web of bids and
counterbids for Perrier. Exor and its two allies, Saint Louis
S.A. and the bank Societe Generale, together control 49.3% of
Perrier. Exor and its allies have been forced to make a bid
for all the shares of Perrier in a heated battle for control
with Swiss food company Nestle S.A. and French food group BSN
S.A., which is bidding for Exor.
   Meanwhile, the French Bourse approved Exor's bid for 100%
of Perrier. The Exor bid values Perrier at 6.05 billion
francs ($1.09 billion), matching the Nestle team bid. But
unlike Nestle, the Exor group says it will buy all shares
offered.
