Marketing Brief -- American Express Co.:
   Expense Managing Service
   Offered on Corporate Cards
The new offering, called Expense Management Services,
could help companies reduce travel and entertainment
administration costs, American Express said. It said a
company on average spends $16 processing an employee's
expense report on its own, while American Express would
charge $3 to $12 for the service.
   Separately, the company said it was "reconfiguring" a
15-month-old pilot program for its Quattro medical charge
card but denied reports that the test was being scrapped. The
Quattro program, which allows a patient to charge his medical
bills on a card rather than having to file claims for
reimbursement, is currently being tested in the Boston area.
