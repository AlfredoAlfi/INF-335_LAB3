Business Brief -- UNC Inc.:
   Quarterly Net Rose 14%;
   Gains Expected for 1992
The jet engine and aircraft parts maker and maintenance
concern said net rose to $2.1 million, or 12 cents a share,
from $1.8 million, or 10 cents a share, a year ago.
   The latest quarter's results came despite a loss from
continuing operations of $30.4 million, or $1.77 a share. But
the company had earnings from discontinued operations in the
1991 fourth quarter of $34.1 million, or $1.99 a share. Those
operations were related to a $67.5 million settlement UNC
reached in the fourth quarter with the U.S. government to
resolve a 1978 uranium lease dispute.
   Sales rose 5% to $96.2 million from $91.6 million.
