Business Brief -- Circle K Corp.:
   Firm Is Given More Time
   To File Reorganization Plan
In asking for the extension, the convenience-store chain
said that its reorganization is a complicated one, and that
more time might enable the company to get some creditors to
agree to the plan. An attorney for the unsecured creditors
agreed with the company, although an attorney for secured
creditors asked that the extension be denied.
