Letters to the Editor:
   Fact Is, Communists
   Can't Run a Country
Which leads to the second error implicit in Ms. House's
editorial. Is it mere bitterness to insist that our country
hold firm with Vietnam on the same values it is insisting on
in Europe, particularly when the communists agreed to
recognize these values 18 years ago?
   The true error in the Bush administration has been to
conduct a separate, and egregiously weak, foreign policy in
Asia. It haunts us in our dealings with Japan and China, and
it manifests itself in the easy manipulation of people like
Ms. House by communists who are highly skilled at propaganda,
yet greatly incompetent when it comes to running a country.
