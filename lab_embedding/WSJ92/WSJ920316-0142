   CBS at the Olympics:
   Absolute Abomination

   In your Feb. 24 article "CBS Wins No. 1 Spot in Ratings
Race, May See Profit From Olympic Games," there was the
following sentence: "It is unclear what effect CBS's ratings
bonanza might have when the networks bid for the 1996 Winter
Olympics in Atlanta."
   If I were CBS, I wouldn't bid that highly -- I've heard
the skiing in Georgia isn't the same caliber as in the Alps.

   If CBS executives think the great ratings they received on
their Winter Olympics programming are due to their coverage,
they are delusional. Everyone watches the Olympics regardless
of what network gets the contract, simply because they are
the Olympics.
   CBS's coverage left a lot to be desired. Seeing two or
three skiers, then jumping to two or three bobsledders, then
jumping to a five-minute spot on some obscure athlete's home
life is not my idea of Olympics coverage. How about seeing a
whole event? Or at least a random 10 or 12 competitors in
each event?
   CBS's expenses probably could have been cut considerably
by omitting some of its "experts," such as Katarina Witt.
Whatever was paid to that young lady, it was too much.
