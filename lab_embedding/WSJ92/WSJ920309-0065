Caterpillar Inc. Steps Up
   Pressure on UAW Strikers
Although the construction-equipment maker wouldn't
elaborate on its statement, labor experts said the company
could be paving the way for inviting strikers back to work
and imposing the "final" contract offer it made last month.
It could also try to hire replacement workers, though that
would sharply escalate the conflict.
   Caterpillar's action also raises the possibility that the
union could expand its walkout. Some 3,800 of its members
remain on the job at various plants, and 800 have been laid
off as a result of the dispute.
   The UAW seeks a "pattern" agreement similar to one it
negotiated at Deere  Co., of Moline, Ill. But Caterpillar
maintains it couldn't stay "globally competitive" with such
an agreement.
