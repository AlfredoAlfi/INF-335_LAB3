Business Brief -- American President Cos.:
   Concern's 4th-Quarter Profit
   Leaped to 65 Cents a Share
The results were a disappointment for analysts, who had
expected the company to earn between 62 cents and 65 cents a
share without any sizable gains from real estate sales. The
Oakland, Calif., shipping company's stock sank $7.50 on heavy
volume to close at $35 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   For the full year, the company had net income of $53.9
million, or $3 a share, including an after-tax charge of
$10.1 million for an accounting change. In the prior year,
American President had a net loss of $59.6 million, or $3.46
a share, including an after-tax restructuring charge of $69.9
million. Revenue for the year rose 7.9% to $2.45 billion from
$2.27 billion.
   American President's results for the full year were buoyed
by revenue from the military, which called on the company to
help ship equipment to the Persian Gulf for Operation Desert
Storm.
