Renault's 1991 Net
   More Than Doubled
   Due to Cost Cutting
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Renault's consolidated sales edged up 1.4% to 166 billion
francs from 163.6 billion francs amid a depressed European
car market, which grew by only 0.8% last year to 14.8 million
units.
   Renault's European sales rose by 0.9% to 1.6 million units
despite depressed markets in France and Spain, and its
European market share held steady at 10.7%.
   The company was seriously affected by a three-week strike
that cut production by 80,000 cars in October and November.
The strike cost Renault 1.5 billion francs and was largely
responsible for a 26% drop in operating profit to 4.66
billion francs from 6.3 billion francs a year earlier,
according to Louis Schweitzer, Renault's general manager.
   The automobile division contributed 4.67 billion francs to
operating profit, down 23% from 6.07 billion francs in 1990,
while the commercial vehicle division's loss widened to 430
million francs from 100 million francs. The truck division
was hurt last year by the collapse of the U.S. truck market,
a price war and a painful restructuring effort that caused
the group's Mack Trucks Inc. subsidiary to incur an operating
loss of 425 million francs.
