Business Brief -- Perini Corp.:
   Cash Bonus Plan Revised
   To Consist of 60% Stock
Perini, based in Framingham, Mass., said about 100
executives at corporate headquarters and its construction and
real estate units will be affected. Under the incentive
compensation plan, employees can receive awards of as much as
100% of their base salary.
   Perini, which had net income of $3.2 million, or 27 cents
a share, in 1991, said it will make its first such payments
under the plan next month.
   About 240,000 shares of common will be issued to
accommodate the plan, an increase of 6% in the number of
shares outstanding, Perini said.
   In 1990, three top executives received a total bonus of
$488,100, which included funds accrued in a 401(k) savings
plan.
