Business Brief -- Fokker N.V.:
   Firm Posts 5% Rise in Net,
   Resumes Dividend Payments
Fokker said that it would pay a dividend of 0.75 guilder a
share, its first payout since 1986. In 1987, Fokker plunged
into the red and required a bailout from the Dutch
government.
   Fokker noted in a statement that even though the airline
industry is depressed, demand for the company's aircraft
remains relatively strong.
   "Barring unforeseen circumstances, a further improvement
of the company's result is expected in 1992," Fokker said.
The company added that the decision to resume dividend
payments for 1991 was based in part on its confidence in the
longer-term outlook.
