Hang Seng Bank Says
   1991 Profit Rose 28%
   On Lending Strength
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The bank's directors proposed paying a dividend of 98 Hong
Kong cents, which would make its full year payout HK$1.25, up
25% from 1990's HK$1. The directors also proposed a 1-for-4
bonus issue.
   Sir Q.W. Lee, chairman, attributed Hang Seng's earnings,
which exceeded most market forecasts, to strong demand for
home mortgage loans and trade financing, in addition to the
British colony's improving economy.
   While the performance of local banks is notoriously
difficult to forecast because of their ability to transfer
funds in and out of secret reserves, analysts were generally
enthusiastic about the results.
   Stella Fung, an analyst at Citicorp Vickers Hong Kong
Ltd., described the results as "quite good," considering the
bank's large earnings base. Ms. Fung estimated that 30% to
40% of the bank's overall profit was transferred to reserves.
   Hang Seng said deposits and other accounts climbed 14% to
HK$228 billion, while loans grew 18% to HK$78.1 billion.
   Looking ahead, Mr. Lee said the bank is unlikely to repeat
its 1991 performance this year, and he cited the growing
earnings base as a reason.
   Ms. Fung said Hang Seng's earnings potential is likely to
be pinched by government steps to control bank mortgage
lending, which is a significant portion of Hang Seng Bank's
loan portfolio.
