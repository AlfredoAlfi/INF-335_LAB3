Business Brief -- Consolidated Rail Corp.:
   Voluntary Separation Offer
   Accepted by 622 Employees
A reserve pool of about 600 work positions has been
established for surplus employees who haven't accepted the
separation offer. The pool will be phased out as more
employees take the offer, Conrail said. It said it still is
processing initial requests for voluntary separation from
workers, and that about 125 more separations may occur
shortly.
