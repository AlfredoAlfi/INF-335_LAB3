   Barnett Banks' Hansel
   Quits as Financial Chief
The departure of Mr. Hansel, 44, surprised many bankers
and Wall Street analysts. The holding company, which is
Florida's largest bank, offered no explanation for his
leaving.
   Mr. Hansel, who spent 20 years at Barnett, is well
regarded in banking circles and contributed heavily to
Barnett's aggressive acquisition efforts over the years. Mr.
Hansel didn't return telephone calls, but said in a statement
that he plans to "seek a challenging opportunity which will
use my skills in building and managing a business."
