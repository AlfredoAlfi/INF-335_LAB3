Marketing Brief -- La Cinq:
   Plan for Bankruptcy Filing
   Is Set Amid Restructuring
Hachette recently announced a drastic restructuring
program at La Cinq, including massive layoffs, in a
last-ditch attempt to bring the channel back to profitability
by 1994. But the media group said last week that it hadn't
been able to find a partner to share the financial
commitments during this period.
   The bankruptcy announcement didn't sit well with France's
media regulators. But a spokeswoman for the Conseil Superieur
de l'Audiovisuel, or CSA, conceded that the regulators have
no authority to intervene with the bankruptcy filing. The CSA
also said in a statement that it would have rejected the
drastic restructuring plan that Hachette had proposed if the
station had continued to operate normally.
