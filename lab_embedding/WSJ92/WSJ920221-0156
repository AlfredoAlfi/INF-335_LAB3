   Special to The Wall Street Journal
For the current year, Green Cross expects its consolidated
pretax profit will amount to 5.80 billion yen, down 6.5% from
the latest reporting period.
   Net income is pegged at 2 billion yen, down 33% from 1991.
But the company projects consolidated sales will rise 1.4% to
103 billion yen.
   The company plans to pay a full-year dividend of 5 yen for
1991, compared with 6 yen in 1990. The 1990 dividend included
a 1-yen special dividend.
   The pretax profit represents operating profit plus
non-operating profit including financial income and expenses.
The net income represents pretax profit plus extraordinary
gains or losses and payments of taxes.
   Unconsolidated results are those of the parent alone.
Consolidated results include those of subsidiaries.
   The company blamed the yen's strength against the dollar
for reducing profits earned in foreign currencies.
Unconsolidated pretax profit in 1991 increased 4.4% to 4.79
billion yen from 4.59 billion yen in 1990 and is expected to
reach 4.80 billion yen in 1992.
   Unconsolidated net income surged 70% to 2.24 billion yen
from 1.32 billion yen and is seen at 1.60 billion yen in
1992. Per-share net income grew to 10.82 yen from 6.38 yen a
year earlier.
