Apple, IBM Say FTC
   Moves to Approve
   Planned Partnership
In October, Apple and IBM formally announced a
wide-ranging partnership aimed at producing future computers
that shared many features. The alliance calls for the
formation of a jointly-owned software company called Taligent
to produce software to control the basic operations of future
computers and a second jointly-owned software company called
Kaleida to pioneer unspecified technologies in consumer
electronics and "multimedia," an emerging field that meshes
computing with information and video fields.
   While it is unusual for the country's two biggest makers
of personal computers to team up, they are trying to gain an
edge in software markets that are dominated by others, most
notably Microsoft Corp.
