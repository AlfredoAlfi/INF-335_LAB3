Business Brief -- DSC Communications Corp.:
   Firm Receives Commitment
   To Buy $41 Million of Gear
Signal transfer points speed the routing of calls through
a telephone network and allow telephone companies to offer
services such as caller identification.
   Sales by DSC, based in Plano, Texas, dropped 23% in the
third quarter from a year earlier and it posted a $78.8
million loss for the period. Sales of its signal transfer
point and related equipment last year dropped to less than
half the $62 million in sales, or 12% of the company's
revenue, that the product line recorded in 1990. However, a
spokesman said, "we're looking for a very good year in STP
business" in 1992.
   DSC said a small portion of the equipment was delivered
last year and most of the deliveries will be made this year.
