CBOT Tests Computers
   During Real-Time Trading
By mid-1993, all traders who buy and sell contracts for
their own accounts will use the computers, the exchanges
said. Floor brokers are expected to join them by mid-1994.
   The computers are designed to make hectic pit trading
faster and more efficient, while creating precise records of
trade times and prices that auditors can cull later to detect
trading abuses. The hand-held terminals beam infrared
impulses to the antenna overhead, which relay signals to a
central computer that matches trades.
   The computer project was announced during the aftermath of
a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe of the Chicago
futures markets, in which altered trading cards were
instrumental in schemes by some traders to profit at the
expense of their customers.
   Many traders worry that the new terminals will be too
cumbersome for pit conditions, but volunteers who used the
terminals said the test went well.
   The two exchanges have spent about $5.5 million on the
computer program, called Audit, over the past two years.
