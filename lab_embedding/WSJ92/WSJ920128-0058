Business Brief -- Metallgesellschaft AG:
   German Company's Dividend
   Probably Won't Be Changed
Mr. Schimmelbusch declined to comment on the
Frankfurt-based company's group after-tax profit, which is
scheduled to be announced Feb. 11.
   The company already reported that pretax profit fell 35%
for the year to 316 million marks ($198.1 million) despite a
7% increase in sales to 21.18 billion marks.
   One of the few profit centers last year was Metallbank
G.m.b.H. The bank's net income rose 3.2 million marks to
20.11 million marks from the year earlier. The bank has good
"long-term growth prospects," Mr. Schimmelbusch said.
