CBOT to Explore Trading
   Of German Bond Futures
"This arrangement, once agreed upon, not only will allow
us to trade the DTB's German bond contract by open outcry on
our trading floor, but it could reduce costs for our traders,
attract new international participants to our markets and
provides us entree into the German marketplace," said Thomas
R. Donovan, CBOT president. The DTB's German bond contract is
currently traded electronically in Frankfurt.
   The CBOT has been seeking to find a German government bond
contract to trade on its exchange for some time. The Board of
Trade had preliminary discussions with the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, which
has a more active German bond contract. But nothing came of
the talks.
