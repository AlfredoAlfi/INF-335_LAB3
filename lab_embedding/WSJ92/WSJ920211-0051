Blinder Robinson
   Ex-Officials Ordered
   To Pay $73.3 Million
The plaintiffs alleged that Mr. Blinder, Mr. Cox and the
brokerage firm reaped markups on stock sales that exceeded
government limits.
   Chances of collecting the multimillion-dollar settlement,
however, are slim, since Blinder Robinson, and its parent
company Intercontinental Enterprises Inc., filed for
bankruptcy court protection in August 1990, and there is a
long line of creditors seeking payment of debts or judgments.
The bankruptcy trustee for Blinder Robinson also has sued Mr.
Blinder, seeking return of corporate assets the trustee says
Mr. Blinder transferred to himself.
   But Michael Latowski, an attorney for the plaintiffs who
won the Philadelphia judgment, said he and other lawyers in
the case have hired counsel in Hong Kong and may hire
investigators to track down assets they suspect Mr. Blinder
has hidden in other countries.
   Messrs. Blinder and Cox couldn't be reached for comment.
