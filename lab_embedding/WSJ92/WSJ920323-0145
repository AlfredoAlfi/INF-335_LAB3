Letters to the Editor:
   Schlesinger's Warning
   On Threat of Tribalism
Mr. Schlesinger, thank you for sounding the alarm on such
a critical issue, which, if left uncorrected, could destroy
the fabric of this nation. Forced political indoctrination
under the guise of multiculturalism has no place in this
nation, even for the purpose of creating self-esteem in
select minorities. There are better ways to create
self-esteem, such as an infrastructure for success in school
and in the workplace.
