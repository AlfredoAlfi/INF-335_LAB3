Bush Deserves Only a 'C,'
   Economists Say in Survey
The latest Blue Chip survey also found that economists
expect the recovery to pick up steam in the spring. They
forecast the economy will grow at a 0.5% annual rate in the
current quarter, 2.2% in the second quarter and 3.1% in the
third.
   The economists said the best items in the president's
budget were the $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers,
the emphasis on cutting capital gains taxes, and the
temporary tax incentive for business investment.
   Items the economists rated worst were the change in
income-tax withholding to increase taxpayer cash income this
year, but reduce it next; the failure of the president to cut
the defense budget more deeply; and his failure to spend more
on rebuilding infrastructure and improving education.
   "A frequent comment was, `Too little, too late,'" Mr.
Eggert said.
