   Loss of $37 Million
   For Latest Quarter
For the year, the company reported a net loss of $49.3
million, or $2.95 a share, compared with a 1990 net loss of
$29.8 million, or $1.82 a share, which included a $15.3
million charge related to restructuring. Revenue for 1991
dropped 16% to $268.6 million from $321.4 million in 1990
amid deteriorating real estate conditions.
   To lessen the impact on future earnings, Harold A. Ellis
Jr., president and chief executive officer, said Grubb 
Ellis decided to accelerate its write-down of goodwill,
taking a charge of about $29.5 million on the 1991 earnings.
"We are beginning to see some stabilization of market
conditions and have cut expenses and downsized our operations
so that we will be in a position to capitalize on a gradually
improving market," Mr. Ellis said.
   Total goodwill for the company at the end of 1990 was more
than $61 million, and arose from the acquisition of 25 real
estate services companies from 1982 to 1986, the company
said. The company said it believes the economic recession and
depressed real estate markets have impaired the long-term
realizable value of the goodwill related to most of these
acquisitions.
