International:
   Israel's Population Passed
   Five Million Mark in 1991
The bureau estimated Israel's population at year end
consisted of 4,150,000 Jews, 695,000 Moslems, 120,000
Christians and 85,000 Druze for a total of 5,050,000 people.
   The population figures include East Jerusalem and the
Golan Heights, both annexed by Israel after their capture in
the 1967 Middle East War, but not the 1,750,000 Palestinians
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, taken in the same
war.
