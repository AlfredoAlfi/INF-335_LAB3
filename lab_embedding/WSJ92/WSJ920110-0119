The institute also said it is delaying salary increases
for institute staff and executives, while keeping committee
meetings and travel for committee members and staff "to a

president.
   Membership grew 2% last year, compared with 8% annual
increases in the early 1980s, Mr. Chenok noted.
   Last year, the institute said it will move 600 of its 800
employees to Jersey City, N.J., this summer, saving about
$130 million in rent over the next 20 years.
