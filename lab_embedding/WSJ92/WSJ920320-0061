   New Reorganization Plan
   Is Reached With Groups
Under the new plan, the banks would receive 76.5% of the
new stock instead of 79% and the debenture holders would get
23.5% of the new stock instead of 21%, plus warrants to
purchase more shares.
   The new plan would still create a company with $648
million in debt and 50 million shares of new common stock.
Current shareholdings would still be wiped out.
   A bankruptcy court hearing on confirmation of the plan is
set for June 25.
