Business Brief -- Hammond Co.:
   Mortgage Banking Concern
   Considers Buying Its Shares
Mr. Hammond said he is "optimistic" that the mortgage
banking concern will be able to raise about $2 million needed
to finance the offer. If the funds are raised, he said, the
company will probably launch a self-tender offer for as many
as 380,000 shares at about $4 each.
   After the announcement, Hammond shares rose $1.1875 to
$4.00 in over-the-counter trading.
   In 1989, Hammond repurchased 405,918 of its shares at $5
each in a tender offer and related purchase. In March 1990,
the company repurchased an additional 391,390 shares at about
$4.83 each.
   If the proposed offer is completed, the company would
become closely held, Mr. Hammond said. It would be delisted
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and wouldn't meet
requirements to be quoted on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
