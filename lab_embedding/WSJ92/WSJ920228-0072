Bridgestone Net Rises
   21% on Sale of Land,
   But Pretax Profit Slips
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Bridgestone also made an early release of consolidated
group earnings for 1991, using final, but rounded numbers.
   Consolidated pretax profit fell 13% in 1991 to 54.6
billion yen from 63.12 billion yen, due primarily to costs of
restructuring U.S. and European operations. The fall was
slimmer than a 21% decline forecast in July. Net income was
higher than expected, owing to gains from fixed asset sales
and profitable subsidiary results.
   Group net income rose 66% to 7.4 billion yen from 4.5
billion yen, while sales slipped 1.1% to 1.764 trillion yen
from 1.784 trillion yen.
   Bridgestone shares ended 30 yen higher at 1,100 yen in
trading Thursday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
