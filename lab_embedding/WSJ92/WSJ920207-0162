Brown-Forman Recall
The citrus bottles' code numbers stamped on the side of
the bottle begin with C04256, and the tropical berry bottles
code numbers begin with C04262. The coolers being recalled
were made at a California bottling plant that produces them
exclusively for western markets.
   So far, no one has reported an exploding bottle,
Brown-Forman said. While the bottles might be dangerous to
open and the cooler itself won't taste good, the coolers
don't pose a health threat when consumed.
