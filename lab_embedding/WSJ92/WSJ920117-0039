   Addams Family TV Creator
   Sues Paramount Over Movie
Mr. Levy, who was the creator and executive producer of
the campy 1960s series, is also seeking a court order to stop
the studio from using the title of the film and the names of
certain characters. "The Addams Family" movie, which doesn't
credit Mr. Levy, was released late last year and has already
grossed more than $100 million.
   Mr. Levy's lawsuit also names Orion Pictures Corp., which
developed and did most of the production on the film, and
several individuals associated with the project.
   The television show's macabre look and darkly funny themes
were inspired by the New Yorker magazine cartoonist Charles
Addams. But the names and character development came from Mr.
Levy, said his lawyer, Neil Papiano.
   Paramount spokesman Harry Anderson said the company hadn't
seen the lawsuit yet and couldn't comment on it. A spokesman
for Orion couldn't be reached for comment.
