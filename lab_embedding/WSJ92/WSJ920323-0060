Business Brief -- Thyssen AG:
   Group Sales Grow by 1%
   As Orders Increase by 4%

profits even if we expect a positive group net result,"
Chairman Kriwet said. The steel industry world-wide is
suffering from overcapacity, and European steelmakers are
facing more competition from lower-priced products from Asia
and Eastern Europe.
