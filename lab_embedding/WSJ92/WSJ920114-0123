Law:
   U.S. Attorney Lehtinen
   Plans to Leave Miami Post
Officials at the Justice Department here privately have
been critical of Mr. Lehtinen's management of the Miami
office, one of the department's biggest and most important
criminal branches. But Attorney General William Barr praised
Mr. Lehtinen in a letter accepting the resignation.
   Mr. Lehtinen, who has strong personal and political ties
to President Bush's family, was appointed by a federal court
under a special procedure in 1988 but was never confirmed by
the Senate. Democratic lawmakers expressed concern about his
reputation for having a mercurial personality, and Justice
Department officials never made a significant push for his
confirmation.
