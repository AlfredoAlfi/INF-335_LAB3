Corona to Issue Stock,
   Debentures to Meet
   Short-Term Needs
"We've got incredibly good {gold-mining} assets. If we can
take care of our debt position, we'll be a much healthier
company," said Peter Steen, president and chief executive
officer.
   The company, which owns some of North America's
lowest-cost gold operations, last year reduced its total debt
by 30% to about 323 million Canadian dollars (US$271
million). Mr. Steen said he would be more comfortable with a
debt load of C$150 million.
   Corona also is under pressure to finance the development
of its rich Eskay Creek ore body in British Columbia, which
is expected to begin production in early 1994.
   In the short term, Corona must redeem about C$55 million
in Series B preferred shares that come due April 30. The
company proposed exchanging at least some of these for
long-term debentures. Any of the preferred shares still
outstanding would be redeemed for cash, which would be raised
through a planned C$50 million issue of common stock, it
said.
   Corona also said it is negotiating a new gold loan to
refinance US$50 million in unsecured notes that come due May
15. A gold loan involves borrowing gold from an institution
on the condition it be replaced at a later date.
   In trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday,
Corona shares closed unchanged at $3.125.
