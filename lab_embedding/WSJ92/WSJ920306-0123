Chicago City Clerk
   Indicted on Charges
   Of Racketeering, Fraud
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The indictment alleges that Mr. Kozubowski, 52 years old,
employed "ghostpayrollers," including two Chicago attorneys,
who were paid salaries for little or no work.
   Mr. Kozubowski also was charged with extortion for
allegedly taking $18,000 from a contractor in exchange for
ensuring that the contractor would keep a city contract. The
government also alleged that he failed to report on his tax
returns money taken from his campaign fund for his own
personal use.
   Mr. Kozubowski was a state representative prior to
becoming the city's clerk in 1979.
   Neither he nor his attorney were available for comment
late yesterday.
