Closed-End Bond Fund
   Data to Appear Mondays
For most of the bond funds, the figure given for the net
asset value, which represents the per-share value of the
fund's portfolio holdings, will continue to be calculated
based on Friday's closing bond prices. But some bond funds,
in order to meet the Journal's Monday publication date, now
will be calculating their net asset values based on
Thursday's prices.
