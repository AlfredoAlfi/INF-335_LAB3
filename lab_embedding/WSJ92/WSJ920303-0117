Duracell to Eliminate Mercury
Small amounts of mercury are used in household batteries
to control the formation of gas. Battery makers have had to
reformulate and redesign batteries to provide the same
performance without using mercury.
   A number of localities are moving to ban disposal of
batteries containing mercury and are requiring manufacturers
to make arrangements to collect used batteries. Several
battery makers have announced new designs that virtually
eliminate mercury in the design.
