Business Brief -- Tiffany  Co.:
   Jewelry Retailer's Net Fell
   20% in Its Fourth Quarter
In the fourth quarter, net totaled $12.1 million, or 76
cents a share, compared with $15.1 million, or 96 cents a
share. Revenue rose 5% to $149 million from $142 million, but
expenses increased as well.
   Fiscal year net dropped to $25.5 million, or $1.61 a
share, from $36.7 million, or $2.34 a share. Without the
accounting charge, net would have been $31.8 million, or
$2.01 a share. Revenue rose 8% to $491.9 million from $455.7
million.
   Chairman William R. Chaney said 1991 earnings were
affected by increased business development expenses. But he
conceded that sales for the year and the quarter were
"disappointing."
   The results, however, were in line with analysts'
expectations and Tiffany shares closed yesterday at $46.75,
up 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
