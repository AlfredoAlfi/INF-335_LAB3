   Earnings at National
   Semiconductor Rose
   In Fiscal 3rd Quarter
The chip maker, which has been enduring a painful
restructuring to catch up with rivals Intel Corp. and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., said it had achieved a goal of
reducing its break-even point to below $400 million in sales
in the quarter, "and we are continuing to track well along
the path to continuing reductions in the break-even point,"
Gilbert F. Amelio, president and chief executive officer,
said.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, National
shares were quoted at $10.625, down 75 cents. The results
were at the high end of analysts' estimates.
   National reported pretax patent-licensing fees of $8.5
million, after reporting no such income in the second
quarter.
   National said it expected the fourth quarter to show the
traditional seasonal improvement from the third quarter.
"Beyond that, we have not yet seen any evidence of
significant strength in the economy," Mr. Amelio said.
