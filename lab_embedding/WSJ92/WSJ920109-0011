Technology:
   Calgene Creates Unit
   To Sell Gene-Altered,
   Rot-Resistant Fruits
Separately, the agricultural biotechnology concern said
that it received a broad patent covering the use of a genetic
engineering technique in plants. The technology, known as
"anti-sense," is used to turn off an unwanted gene, such as
the gene responsible for the production of an enzyme that
causes tomatoes to turn soft.
   Calgene's tomato, which employs anti-sense techniques to
extend shelf life, will be the first product slated for
marketing by the new Calgene Fresh unit. In addition to the
anti-sense tomato, he said the unit plans to market other
perishable vine-ripened fruits such as berries and melons.
