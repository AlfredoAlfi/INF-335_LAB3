Business Brief -- Penn Central Corp.:
   Spinoff to Be Considered
   For Manufacturing Lines
The company said it would likely retain more than $200
million in debt and/or equity in the spunoff operations,
which consist of wire, cable, materials handling and marine
equipment businesses. The spinoff wouldn't include the
company's insurance and defense service operations or smaller
manufacturing and energy businesses.
   Penn Central said a spinoff would split the company's
operations into two entities and enable it to focus on
specialty insurance operations. The company said it believes
that as long as manufacturing is a part of Penn Central, the
company's stock won't fully reflect the value of its
insurance and defense businesses.
   The company said the carrying value of the businesses
expected to be spunoff totaled $609.5 million as of Sept. 30.
Those operations had sales of $781.4 million for the first
nine months of 1991 and an operating loss of $4.4 million.
