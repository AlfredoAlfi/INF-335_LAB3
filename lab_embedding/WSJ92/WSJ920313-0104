Business Brief -- Homeplex Mortgage Investments:
   Fourth-Period Loss Posted;
   Cut in Dividend Expected
For the year, Homeplex reported net income of $8 million,
or 81 cents a share, compared with $10.8 million, or $1.11 a
share, in 1990. The company's stock was quoted at $5.75, down
12.5 cents a share, in late New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Homeplex said it expects to report first-quarter net of
$2.5 million to $3 million, or 25 cents to 30 cents a share,
In the year-earlier period, it had net of $3.8 million, or 39
cents a share. Alan Hamberlin, chairman and president,
attributed the decline to the drop in mortgage rates and the
resulting wave of refinancings.
   The low rates also have allowed the company to reduce its
bank debt and short-term borrowings to about $35 million at
Feb. 29 from about $51 million at Dec. 31, 1990. Mr.
Hamberlin said the company is considering asset purchases to
increase net income.
