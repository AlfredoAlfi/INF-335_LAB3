Business Brief -- Interco Inc.:
   Revised Reorganization Plan
   Reflects Creditors' Concerns
The medium-term note holders would receive only cash and
notes instead of cash, notes and stock. And holders of
Interco's junk bonds would get more stock than originally
proposed, plus warrants to buy stock. As with the original
plan, current shareholders would receive nothing.
   The amended plan would create a furniture and shoe company
with debts of $648 million and new stock with an estimated
value of $412.5 million. That's slightly more debt and
slightly less stock than originally proposed.
