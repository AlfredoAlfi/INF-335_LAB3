Beverly Enterprises
   Reaches a Settlement
   On Shareholder Suits
One group of lawsuits, seeking class-action status, was
filed in federal court in Los Angeles. The lawsuits charged
that the company inflated its stock price by misrepresenting
its financial position and prospects. In January 1988, the
company disclosed that it expected to report losses for the
fourth quarter of 1987 and the first half of 1988, said it
was in default on certain terms of $725 million in debt and
discontinued its dividend.
   A separate lawsuit, also seeking class-action status, was
filed in Delaware state court. It charged that the company
made similar misstatements in seeking shareholder approval of
its reincorporation. The company said the Delaware claims
were incorporated into the California settlement, which is
contingent on the Delaware suit being dismissed. Beverly said
the settlement is subject to approval of both courts.
   The company said it has sufficient reserves to cover its
portion of the settlement and said its payment won't have a
material adverse impact on its financial position or results.
While the company said it believes the claims are without
merit, it said it and its insurance carrier agreed to settle
to avoid the costs of litigation.
