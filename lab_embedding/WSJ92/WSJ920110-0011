   Civil-Law Reforms
{Discovery is a pretrial fact-finding process. Under the
Quayle proposals, each party in a lawsuit would be required
to give the other side the names and addresses of all persons
with relevant information about a case and disclose the
location of all pertinent documents. Refusals to comply would
be grounds for barring the offending party from obtaining
additional information.}
   LCJ, a national coalition of defense trial lawyers and
corporate counsel, supports an array of civil-justice reforms
designed to achieve fairness and cost-efficiency in the
civil-justice system. Overall, we are pleased that the
President's Council on Competitiveness has focused needed
attention on the topic of civil-justice reform, and we look
forward to assisting in the implementation of its proposals.
