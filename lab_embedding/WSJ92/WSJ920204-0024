Technology:
   ATT-Led Group
   To Build Fiber-Optic
   System in Caribbean
The 112-mile undersea cable system -- named Taino-Carib
for the Indians who first inhabited the islands -- will link
Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and Tortola starting this fall, ATT
said.
   The cable, which was designed by ATT Bell Laboratories,
is half the diameter of present transoceanic cables and uses
no electronic regenerating equipment to boost the signal. Six
pairs of optical fibers run through it and carry signals at a
rate of 560 million bits a second -- or about 225,000
simultaneous phone calls, ATT said. By comparison, the TAT-9
trans-Atlantic system scheduled to begin service March 2 has
three pairs of fibers and can carry 80,000 phone calls, ATT
said.
   The Taino-Carib system will be built by ATT Submarine
Systems Inc., a unit of ATT.
