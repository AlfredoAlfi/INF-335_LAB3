Economy:
   Fed Governor Switched
   Stance on Monetary Policy
But three days later, after some intense behind-the-scenes
discussions, the reserve board voted to cut the discount
rate, the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions,
by a full percentage point. In that vote, Mr. LaWare sided
with the majority; Gov. Wayne Angell objected.
   The Fed released a summary of the Dec. 17 deliberations
Friday after the customary lag. The Open Market Committee met
again last week, but so far has given no signal in financial
markets that it is lowering interest rates again.
   At the Dec. 17 meeting, Fed officials noted a "pause in
the business recovery" and "very gloomy business and consumer
sentiment." They said they saw "no clear indications that the
recovery was resuming."
