Business Brief:
   Microsoft's Growth Spans 8 Quarters
   As Fiscal 2nd-Period Profit Rose 55%
The company, which is the world's largest supplier of
personal computer software, said demand for its popular
Windows-based software remained strong. A company spokesman
said Microsoft's gross profit margin increased for the eighth
consecutive quarter because of "a combination of channel mix,
product mix, and manufacturing efficiencies."
   Microsoft's earnings impressed industry analysts with
slightly higher than predicted figures. "The real problem for
those on Wall Street is coming up with superlatives to
describe this company," said analyst Peter Rogers of
Robertson, Stephens  Co. Analysts' concerns about the
effects on the company's earnings from increased competition,
lawsuits or Federal Trade Commission inquiries into market
monopolizing are "diminishing," he said.
   Analysts said they expect the company's strong performance
to continue throughout the second half of the year.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Microsoft dipped
$1.25, closing at $126.50 after reaching a high of $129.50.
   For its first six months, the company posted a 59% rise in
net income to $319 million compared with $200.5 million a
year ago. Revenue rose 52% to $1.26 billion compared with
$830 million a year earlier.
