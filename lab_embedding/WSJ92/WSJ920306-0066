Business Brief -- HealthVest:
   REIT Will Offer Proposal
   To Reorganize Healthcare
Under Healthcare's plan, Healthcare would acquire
HealthVest for $3.25 a share, or about $35 million, a move
that would allow Healthcare to eliminate about $146 million
in senior debt owed to HealthVest.
   Other Healthcare creditors would receive stock. Greenery
Rehabilitation Group Inc., which holds about $9 million in
senior debt and is a large shareholder, would end up owning
about 60% of the company. Holders of $29.3 million in
subordinated debentures would own 15% of the company, other
unsecured creditors would own 15%, preferred holders would
own 6% and current stockholders would own 4%.
   Healthcare sought protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last year after struggling
with a liquidity crisis for months.
