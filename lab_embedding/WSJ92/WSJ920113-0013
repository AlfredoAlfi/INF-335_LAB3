Keating Expected to Face
   Additional Fraud Charges
Additionally, the people said, the expected indictment is
likely to allege that Mr. Keating and the others looted
furnishings and art from the offices of an increasingly
troubled American Continental, which filed for federal
bankruptcy law protection in April 1989.
   The value of the office property covered by the expected
charges is "less than $5 million," one person familiar with
the case said. The anticipated new charges would add
bankruptcy fraud to the long list of federal crimes of which
Mr. Keating now stands accused.
   The core of the federal government's case has been brought
in Los Angeles, where Mr. Keating was indicted by a federal
grand jury last month on wide-ranging charges of bank fraud
related to the collapse of the company's former Lincoln
Savings  Loan Association unit. Mr. Keating has denied any
wrongdoing in connection with that case.
   Reached at home over the weekend, Mr. Keating's lawyer,
Stephen C. Neal, said, "I do understand there will be an
indictment, and it's my understanding that the indictment may
charge various bankruptcy law violations."
