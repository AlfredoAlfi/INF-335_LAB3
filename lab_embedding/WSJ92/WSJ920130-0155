Invacare Corp. to Post
   A Rise of 11% or More
   In Fourth-Quarter Net
Mr. Mixon said Invacare expects robust growth in overseas
sales, particularly in Germany, which is absorbing an influx
of people from the former Soviet bloc and in need of medical
equipment. In 1992, European and Canadian sales will
represent as much as 25% of total sales, or about $55 million
a year.
   Meanwhile, Invacare is cutting expenses and improving
plant productivity. "We expect our profitability to grow
faster than our sales," Mr. Mixon said.
   Invacare introduced more than 75 new products in 1991,
which are now hitting the marketplace -- including
respiratory aids for homebound patients. Invacare said it is
maintaining a dominant position in standard home-care
products such as wheelchairs, walkers, beds, and kitchen and
bathroom aids.
   Mr. Mixon said Invacare is in a strong cash position to
make substantial acquisitions but wouldn't say if major
purchases are pending. "We're a very opportunistic company
continually looking to strengthen ourselves strategically in
individual market segments."
   In late national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Invacare shares sank $2.75, to $21.75. The company couldn't
be reached for comment on the sharp drop.
