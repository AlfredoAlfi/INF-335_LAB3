GM's Opel May Shift in Japan
Opel said the planned change was an effort to better
position itself in Japan. Yanase is Japan's largest
distributor of imported cars, with 250 dealerships of its own
and an additional 350 belonging to affiliated companies.
   A Yanase spokesman said talks with Opel will begin soon.
Although Yanase handles Opel competitors, such as Volkswagen,
the spokesman said the company is receptive to new business
opportunities.
