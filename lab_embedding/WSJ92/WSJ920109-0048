Business Brief -- Union Electric Co.:
   Sale of Several Businesses
   Is Planned for $68.5 Million
Cipsco's Central Illinois Public Service Co. unit would
pay $8.5 million for the retail properties in northern
Illinois and would purchase power from Union Electric through
a three-year contract. This transaction involves properties
in Henderson and Hancock counties in Illinois and would
transfer 4,200 Illinois customers to Central Illinois.

the boards of all companies involved, as well as regulatory
clearances, will be used to retire debt and to focus on Union
Electric's core business in Missouri and the metro-east area
of southwestern Illinois.
