Employee Benefit
   Reports a Drop in Net
   For Its Second Period
The year-ago period was boosted by a $2 million, or 27
cents a share tax benefit; excluding that item, the latest
quarter's earnings rose 16%, and per-share earnings were flat
with the year-earlier period.
   That performance -- which reflects an increase in the
number of shares outstanding to 8.2 million from 7.1 million
-- came despite a 40% increase in revenue, to $53.4 million
from $38.2 million.
   Analysts had been expecting higher revenue, and per-share
earnings of 45 to 48 cents, until the company's recent
disclosure that it expected 34 cent-a-share second-quarter
results. Employee Benefit shares, which had recently surged
upward to the low $60s, plunged $30.125 to $30.375 in the
session following that news. The shares have since registered
a modest further decline: In late composite New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, EBP was quoted at $26.75, off
$2.125.
   Employee Benefit also said that two separate shareholder
lawsuits alleging violation of securities laws had been filed
against the company in the wake of the stock's big decline.
   The company said it considers the suits "without merit,"
and said it intends to "vigorously defend" itself in the
litigation.
