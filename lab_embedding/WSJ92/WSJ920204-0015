Business Brief:
   Dow Corning Net
   Fell 35% in Period
   On Special Charge
Dow Corning is a major maker of silicone-gel breast
implants, whose safety has been questioned by the Food and
Drug Administration, which is investigating the devices. The
company assessed the charge against fourth-quarter earnings
to cover any legal liability arising from the implants, the
costs of unused inventory and of trying to prove the
implants' safety.
   Last month, when the company said it would take the
charge, it also closed the production lines that make the
implants. Breast-implant sales represent only about 1% of Dow
Corning's total sales and the business has been unprofitable
for "a number of years," the company said.
   For all of 1991, Dow Corning earned $152.9 million, down
10.6% from the year-earlier $171.1 million, on a 7% sales
gain to $1.85 billion.
