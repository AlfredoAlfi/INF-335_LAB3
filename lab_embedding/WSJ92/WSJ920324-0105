Dividend News:
   Advanta Approves
   Dual Class Stock Plan,
   Sets Dividend Increase
The plan is subject to approval at the April 24 annual
meeting.
   The company said the plan would increase financing
flexibility and promote management continuity. The company is
proposing to increase authorized shares to 30 million for
each class of stock. Thus, it could sell additional nonvoting
shares to raise capital, or issue them for acquisitions,
without diluting current shareholder voting power. Officers
and directors control about 40% of the company.
   The plan will increase the number of shares outstanding to
22.2 million from 11.1 million currently.
   Directors could pay quarterly dividends on the nonvoting
shares of as much as 20% higher, but not lower, than the
dividend on voting shares. Advanta said directors intend,
subject to shareholder approval, to pay a second-quarter
dividend of four cents on each voting share and 4.8 cents on
each nonvoting share, a 47% increase over the six cents paid
in the first quarter.
   Both the classes of shares are expected to be listed on
the National Association of Securities Dealers' national
market system.
