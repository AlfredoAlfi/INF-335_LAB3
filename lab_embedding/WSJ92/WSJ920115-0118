   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The charges cap a four-month investigation and the
gathering of 125 volumes of evidence, the Tass news agency
said. In addition to the alleged plotters themselves, the
actions of the KGB, the armed forces, the Communist Party and
other institutions were reviewed, Tass said.
   Among those charged were former Soviet KGB chief Vladimir
Kryuchkov, Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov, Defense Minister
Dmitri Yazov, Supreme Soviet Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov and
Vice President Gennady Yanayev.
   All but two of the 12 suspects remain in prison. Former
KGB Gen. Viktor Grushko and Valery Boldin, the former chief
of staff to then-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, have
been sent to hospitals because of poor health.
