Insurers See No Big Claims
   From California Flooding
The Monday rains, amounting to nearly eight inches in some
parts of the San Fernando Valley, created nightmarish traffic
problems, power outages and mudslides, and caused floods in
some areas. The Los Angeles River flowed over its concrete
banks into the Sepulveda Dam Basin in Van Nuys, flooding
nearby streets and nearly submerging dozens of automobiles in
the area. Helicopters and local firefighters were called in
to rescue motorists.
   Still, major California insurance companies said the level
of damage reported so far by businesses and homeowners wasn't
major. Auto insurers said they expected costs associated with
car accidents and injuries, but didn't anticipate unusual
claims due to the rains.
   A spokeswoman for the California Department of
Transportation said highways and freeways hadn't been
damaged, but added that the agency would have to pay
maintenance and cleanup costs, including overtime pay for
many workers. In San Diego, the storms halted repair work on
a sewage pipe that has been gushing partly treated sewage
into the ocean since earlier this month; work might not
resume until next week, officials said.
