   Sweet-Smelling Bush
   Blooms in Texas Winter
Ms. Hagen says it was introduced to the Western world in
the 1840s by the Royal Horticultural Society. A man named
Thomas Affleck owned an outstanding nursery in Mississippi,
and in the 1850-1860 decade moved it to the area of Brenham,
Texas, in Washington County. His fame as an agriculturist and
horticulturist was very widespread at the time, and his
writings were published extensively. The land where I found
the L. fragrantissima borders what was Affleck's Glenblythe
plantation. I cannot prove it, but it seems highly likely
that the winter honeysuckle was introduced into this area by
Affleck. If not, I cannot account for its presence here.
