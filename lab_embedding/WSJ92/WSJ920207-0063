Technology:
   Solectron Is in Talks
   About Taking Over
   Certain IBM Work
IBM, which has been slowly shedding unnecessary
operations, would agree to buy a certain number of circuit
boards from Solectron. IBM didn't elaborate. Nor did it
disclose how big a position it would take in Solectron.
   The companies said they don't expect to complete contracts
until later this year but disclosed the talks now because
they were material to Solectron.
   Solectron stock rose $2.75 on the news, closing at $50 in
over-the-counter trading.
