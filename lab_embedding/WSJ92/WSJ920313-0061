Berlusconi Hits Snag
   In Effort to Rescue
   French TV Station
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
"It's very difficult to find someone who is willing to go
against the establishment," he said. Mr. Berlusconi controls
25% of La Cinq, along with the station's current operator,
French media group Hachette S.A. Mr. Berlusconi has put
together a proposal to save the station on condition that he
win management control.
   La Cinq shareholders are set to meet March 24 to complete
details of the capital boost, which was agreed to last month.
Bankruptcy court authorities and government regulators must
still approve the rescue plan.
   "I'm pretty determined (to go ahead), but I can't insist
beyond reason," Mr. Berlusconi said. He added that time is
pressing because La Cinq is losing about 500 million lire a
day.
   Mr. Berlusconi also said a review of La Cinq's accounts
showed that at an operating level, results "aren't
disastrous." He didn't elaborate or reveal any figures.
