Technology:
   Pfizer to Test New Sweetener
Biospherics said D-tagatose tastes, feels and acts like
sugar. It said it received a patent in 1988 for the
sweetener's use as a food additive.
   Pfizer declined to say how long the evaluation period
would be. The company already has an application pending with
the Food and Drug Administration for another sweetener called
alitame.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Biospherics closed
at $8.50, up 75 cents.
   D-tagatose is made from a related sugar molecule,
D-galactose, which is found in dairy whey and lactose. Its
major advantage is that it provides the same physical bulk as
sugar, an important feature in baking.
