Sen. D'Amato Urges
   Brady's Resignation
"Banks have turned into government bond funds," said Sen.
D'Amato in a Senate speech. He previously has asked Mr. Brady
to issue more short-term debt, rather than long-term
government debt.
   The New York Republican, who is up for re-election this
year, accused Mr. Brady of mishandling the economy and
failing to ease the credit shortage.
   Sen. D'Amato is the second Republican senator who has
called for the resignation of Mr. Brady recently. Sen. Connie
Mack of Florida, who is critical of the administration's
economic policies, has said President Bush should ask Mr.
Brady to resign.
   The Treasury Department didn't comment.
