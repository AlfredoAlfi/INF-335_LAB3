Business Brief -- Lloyds Bank PLC:
   Concern Posts 9% Increase
   In Pretax Profit for 1991
Lloyds' figures are expected to be the best of a poor
batch when the other three British clearing banks announce
their results this week.
   Lloyds Chairman Sir Jeremy Morse said the bank had
achieved its "reasonably robust" performance thanks to a
combination of cost-cutting through staff reductions and
increased revenue from fees for banking and financial
services.
