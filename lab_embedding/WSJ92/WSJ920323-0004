Bekaert N.V. Plans
   To Sell Its 49% Stake
   In Japanese Venture
A Bekaert spokesman said the stake is carried on Bekaert's
books at about five billion Belgian francs ($145.1 million)
and that the sale should produce a "substantial" capital
gain. But he declined to forecast the proceeds, saying that
would depend on market conditions.
   The spokesman said BSB has annual earnings of about five
billion yen ($37.4 million) on sales of 40 billion yen.
Bekaert is one of the world's biggest producers of steel
cord, which is used to reinforce tires and other rubber
products.
   The spokesman said Bekaert is unwinding its ties with
Bridgestone because, as a supplier to the tire industry, it
didn't want to be too closely associated with any one tire
maker. "We want to keep our hands free," he said. The
spokesman added that the relationship between Bekaert and
Bridgestone has changed in light of the Japanese company's
1988 acquisition of Firestone Tire  Rubber Co. of the U.S.
That acquisition transformed Bridgestone from primarily a
Japanese tire maker to a global producer.
   Bekaert's spokesman said the company would try to
re-establish itself in the Japanese market, possibly through
another joint venture.
