Intellicall in Default
   On Debt, Will Restate
   Its Financial Results
In addition, the company said that it also is in default
on its $10 million senior note owed to an insurance company
because it has been in violation of terms of the debt since
Sept. 30.
   Intellicall said it is negotiating with its lenders to
obtain waivers of the covenant violations and to modify the
covenants. It said it expects to be required to make payments
to the lenders to get such concessions. At Dec. 31, it owed
$30 million on the credit line and $9 million on the senior
note.
   Intellicall also said the audit committee of its board
plans to investigate why the company failed to make timely
disclosures of the change in its debt situation.
