Economy:
   Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
President Bush suggested recently that the U.S. economy is
in a "free fall." Economic data, however, point to growth,
says Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government
Securities Ltd. in New York.
   Mr. Levy says this week's release of fourth-quarter Gross
Domestic Product will buttress his view. The broadest gauge
of U.S. economic health, GDP will show an economy expanding
1.5% at an annual rate, he estimates. He contends,
furthermore, that the economy is maintaining that pace, be it
"ever so modest," in early 1992.
   Mr. Levy acknowledges that retail and automobile sales
were poor in the fourth quarter. But increased spending on
services came close to offsetting that weakness, he says. And
a narrower trade gap and improved investment in homes and
durable-goods equipment also boosted growth.
   December data due for release this week will highlight why
annual economic growth has been held below 2%. Personal
income, for example, probably rose 0.4%, but personal
spending likely fell 0.2%, Mr. Levy says. While more people
worked more hours for more pay last month, the increased
income wasn't enough to lift consumer spending, he says.
   Manufacturers may already be suffering from the end of the
Cold War. Mr. Levy estimates new orders for durable goods
last month fell 1%, as a drop in defense-related procurement
dufsed a 4% gain in nondefense orders.
