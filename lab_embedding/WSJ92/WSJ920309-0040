Business Brief -- Upjohn Co.:
   Firm Gets FDA Approval
   For Its Diabetes Treatment
Pharmaceutical companies can somewhat blunt the onslaught
of generic competition when drug compounds lose patent
protection by improving the formulation of the compounds and
placing them in patented drug delivery systems.
   The PresTab tablets will allow users to take a lower
dosage of Glynase than they did with Micronase, but a larger
percentage of the drug will ultimately be absorbed in the
bloodstream.
   Upjohn is based in Kalamazoo, Mich.
