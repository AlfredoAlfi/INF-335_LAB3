International:
   Paris Bourse Officials Clear
   New Rule on Tender Offers
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The three-year-old rule, originally intended to keep
takeover costs down for businesses and leave companies quoted
on the market after takeovers, has led to thorny legal
tangles and bitter squabbles between shareholders in the
controversial takeovers of Au Printemps S.A., Exor S.A. and
Source Perrier S.A.
   The rule has been most heavily criticized for unfair
treatment of minority shareholders. The main problem, critics
have said, is that once the two-thirds bid is over, the
target's share price generally collapses, leaving the
minority shareholders with devalued shares of a company in
which they may no longer want a stake.
   The Conseil des Bourses de Valeur, which supervises the
Paris Bourse and must approve all takeover bids, said its
proposals will be formalized and transmitted next month to
Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy for approval.
