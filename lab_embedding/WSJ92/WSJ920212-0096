   Cuomo State Budget
   Leaner? Fat Chance
-- All-funds spending (the total budget) would increase by
$3.2 billion, or 6% over last year's budget.
   -- The governor is proposing to issue $531 million in
deficit notes to fill this year's projected budget gap.
   -- Another questionable bond act would be floated, this
one worth $800 million and slated for public-works projects.
   -- More than $700 million in "one-shot" fiscal gimmicks
would be used if the governor's proposal is enacted.
   -- The governor's so-called Medicaid reforms are mostly
provider-side taxes, reimbursement adjustments and fiscal
gimmickry. True programmatic reforms total only $87 million;
new taxes and other assessments total $743 million.
   -- The governor's proposed changes to welfare are minimal
and save a paltry amount of money. More-comprehensive
welfare-reform proposals have been made by the Empire
Foundation and others that would save as much as $1.1
billion.
   This budget is far from what you called "lean" and full of
"significant reforms."
