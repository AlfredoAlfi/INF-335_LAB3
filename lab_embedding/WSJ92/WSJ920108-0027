Homestake Is Taking
   $29 Million Charge
   On Retirees' Benefits
Homestake didn't issue any fourth-quarter estimates.
However, the company's full-year 1991 estimate indicates a
fourth-quarter net loss of roughly $44 million, or 44 cents a
share. That compares with a loss of $31.4 million, or 32
cents a share, in last year's fourth quarter. A full
financial report for the periods is slated for release in
February.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Homestake closed at $14.75, down 12.5 cents.
   Homestake said its year-end estimate included a "small"
loss from gold operations, $70 million in administrative,
general and exploration expenses, and $64 million of
write-downs taken in the second quarter to reduce the
carrying value of several mining properties and investments.
   For several quarters, Homestake has been hurt by depressed
gold prices and low mine output. A spokeswoman said the
company expected gold production to return to normal levels
in 1992, but had no predictions about gold prices.
