Business Brief -- Crown Central Petroleum Corp.:
   Concern Posts Net Losses
   For Quarter and Full Year
The company said the disappointing results were due to a
weak economy, lower demand for petroleum products and
intensely competitive market conditions, resulting in lower
sales volumes and "substantially" lower margins.
   "Competition intensified throughout 1991. Our margins,
already measured in fractions of pennies per gallon, were
squeezed even tighter as companies fought to maintain or gain
market share, through aggressive pricing at the pumps," said
Henry A. Rosenberg, Jr., chairman of the company. "In
December, refining margins plunged as product prices fell
faster than the cost of crude."
   Crown Central posted a full-year net loss of $6 million,
or 61 cents a share, compared with net income of $26 million,
or $2.65 a share, a year earlier. Sales and operating revenue
sank 14% to $1.8 billion from $2.06 billion.
