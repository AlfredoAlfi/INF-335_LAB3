Coca-Cola Is Sued
   By Group of Holders
   Of Its Largest Bottler
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 44%-owned by Coca-Cola,
completed its acquisition of Johnston, based in Chattanooga,
Tenn., in December. The combined companies control about 55%
of the Coca-Cola bottling system in the U.S.
   Neither Coca-Cola nor Coca-Cola Enterprises, both based in
Atlanta, would comment on the litigation. Coca-Cola
Enterprises was named as a nominal defendant in the suit.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises disclosed the suit in its latest
proxy statement. The plaintiffs, Three Bridges Investment
Group, filed the suit in Chancery Court in Wilmington, Del.,
in December, a week before the merger was completed.
Coca-Cola is incorporated in Delaware.
   The suit revolves around an alleged conflict of interest.
To increase sales of its own syrup, Coca-Cola, according to
the suit, gains control of bottlers and then presses them to
cut soft-drink prices. But those lower prices, according to
the suit, cut into profit margins among bottlers, including
Coca-Cola Enterprises.
   The suit asks that the merger between Coca-Cola
Enterprises and Johnston be rescinded and seeks unspecified
damages.
