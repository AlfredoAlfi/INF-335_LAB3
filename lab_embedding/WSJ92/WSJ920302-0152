In the third quarter, GDP rose at a less-than-robust 1.8%
annual rate. A second revision of the fourth-quarter GDP data
will be released before the end of this month.
   "What does this tell us about the future? Not all that
much," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist with Fuji
Securities in Chicago. "This doesn't change policy or
expectations."
   The largest upward revisions in GDP -- the total output of
goods and services produced in the U.S. -- came in personal
consumption and business inventories. While a rise in
consumer spending is a positive sign, a rise in inventories
often isn't.
   "The main implication is that there is not going to be
much if any growth in the first quarter," said Merrill Lynch
economist Bruce Steinberg. "In fact, we can probably expect a
small decline in the first quarter."
   "This recovery will putter along without a big head of
steam and without significant reductions in the unemployment
rate," predicted Washington-based economist John Albertine of
Albertine Enterprises.
   All the figures have been adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.
