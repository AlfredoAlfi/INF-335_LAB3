Business Brief -- Nike Inc.:
   Competitor Amends Lawsuit
   Alleging Shoe Infringements
Avia is claiming Nike "pirated" its patented Cantilever
sole, designed to absorb shock and avoid injury. The company
is seeking damages and a permanent injunction against the
sale of Nike Air 180 running and basketball shoes.
   Nike previously denied the infringement and filed
counterclaims alleging Avia has infringed on Nike patents.
The company says the lawsuit won't have any material impact
on its business.
   "We believe we have defenses to all claims related to the
running shoe," Lindsay Stewart, Nike's vice president and
corporate counsel said. "And we have even more valid defenses
related to the basketball shoe claim."
