Business Brief -- Fleer Corp.:
   Sports Card Marketer's Net
   Fell 62% in Fourth Quarter
Fleer shares closed yesterday at $24.25, down $1.625, in
over-the-counter trading.
   The company blamed its lackluster performance on
higher-than-expected returns by retailers of its products and
increased competition. Fleer said it is responding by moving
its product line upscale and trimming certain channels of
distribution.
   For the year, Fleer's net rose 8.5% to $23.4 million, or
$2.47 a share, from $21.6 million, or $2.53 a share, a year
earlier. The average number of shares outstanding rose to
9,456,103 from 8,524,424. Revenue rose 12% to $161.6 million
from $144.3 million in 1990.
