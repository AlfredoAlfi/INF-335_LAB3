Business Brief -- UnionFed Financial Corp.:
   Loss in December Quarter
   Narrowed From Year Ago
Although the bank's core capital ratio of 2.86% at Dec. 31
was less than the regulatory minimum, and its risk-based
capital ratio of 4.92% also was less than the minimum, the
company said it was in compliance with a plan approved by the
Office of Thrift Supervision last September, under which it
would meet interim targets until fulfilling the requirements
by 1994. Under the plan, the bank has stopped engaging in
commercial or construction lending.
