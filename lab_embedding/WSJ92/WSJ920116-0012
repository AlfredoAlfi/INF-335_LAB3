Mead Corp. to Take
   After-Tax Charges
   Against '91 Earnings
Without the charges and the gain from the sale of
Micromedex, Mead 1991 earnings, to be reported Jan. 23, would
have been about $1.21 a share, Mead said. For 1990, the
company earned $38.5 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales
of $4.8 billion, Mead said.
   About $1 of the $1.54 charges against 1991 will be taken
to comply with a new accounting rule, No. 106 by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief rule maker
for accounting. The rule requires companies to set aside
money for retiree life and health insurance in advance,
instead of paying as they go.
   Mead will also take a charge of 17 cents a share to
increase reserves for its discontinued reinsurance business.
   Of the total charge, 15 cents a share will be used to cap
Mead's landfills in Escanaba, Mich., and Chilicothee, Ohio,
and save for anticipated capping costs.
   About 13 cents a share will be used to consolidate certain
business units. A Mead spokeswoman would not elaborate.
   And nine cents a share will be used to write off the cost
of a feasibility study the company did on building a new pulp
and paper mill. The project was indefinitely postponed last
spring.
