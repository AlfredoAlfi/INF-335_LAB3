Business Brief -- Symbol Technologies Inc.:
   Company Establishes Fund
   To Settle Shareholder Suits
The fund consists of $7,250,000 from an insurance company
and $4,250,000 of six-year warrants with an exercise price
$12 higher than the stock's market price at the time the
settlement is completed.
   Symbol, a Bohemia, N.Y., maker of portable data collection
systems, said the settlement won't materially affect its
financial position. The company "categorically" denied all
charges but said it agreed to the settlement because it
didn't require any cash payment and avoids the expense of
further legal proceedings. The settlement is subject to
federal court approval.
