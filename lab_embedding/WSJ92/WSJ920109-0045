   Of U.S. Unit Chairman
Minolta said Mr. Kusumoto has been president of the U.S.
unit since 1969, one of the longest tenures of any Japanese
chief executive in North America. During that time, Minolta's
U.S. operations have grown from $11 million in sales to $780
million.
   Minolta said Mr. Kusumoto will devote more time to
long-term strategies for the company, while Mr. Kanaya will
direct day-to-day operations. The three product divisions --
photographic, business equipment and document imaging systems
-- will report directly to Mr. Kanaya.
