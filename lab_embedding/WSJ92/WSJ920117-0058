Business Brief -- Hyundai Motor Co.:
   Workers Seize Plant, Expel
   Management in Pay Dispute
"We are stepping up vigilance against a possible police
raid, which is likely to come in a few days," union leader
Park Sangchull said.
   On Wednesday, Hyundai's management shut down the plant
indefinitely to counter what it called an illegal work
slowdown that had crippled operations.
   He said the workers took over all five factories at the
sprawling plant in Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul,
and ordered nonunion employees to leave by 5 p.m. local time
Thursday.
   The company called off negotiations with the union and
said workers would not be paid during the closure. Workers
vowed to continue to occupy the plant until the company
reopens it and pays special year-end bonuses.
