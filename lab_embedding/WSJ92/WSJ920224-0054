Business Brief -- Tucson Electric Power Co.:
   Judge Approves Settlement
   Of $30 Million for Holders
As previously reported, Tucson Electric said its
directors' and officers' liability insurance companies,
Lloyd's of London and Associated Electric  Gas Insurance
Services Ltd., Brooklyn, N.Y., will cover the settlement.
   The suits alleged that Tucson Electric and certain company
officers misrepresented and failed to disclose material facts
concerning the company, leading shareholders to buy common
stock at artificially inflated prices. The plaintiffs
contended they sustained substantial losses.
