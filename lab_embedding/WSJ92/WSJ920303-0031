Business Brief -- Cummins Engine Co.:
   Offering of 2 Million Shares
   Is Planned to Reduce Debt
Cummins shares were quoted in late trading yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange at $61.50, off $1.75. That price
gives the offering an indicated value of $123 million. After
the offering, Cummins would have 16.8 million shares
outstanding.
   Morgan Stanley  Co. is lead underwriter.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. responded postively,
placing Cummins' $375 million of debt and preferred stock
under review for possible upgrade. Moody's said it will
assess the impact of the increased equity and proposed debt
reduction on the company's capital structure and
debt-protection measurements.
   The rating service said it will examine Cummins's
"competitive position and its ability to generate
more-predictable earnings and cash flows," keeping a close
eye on how the company resolves its "product quality and cost
problems." In 1991, Cummins posted a loss of $14.1 million,
or $1.49 a share, on sales of $3.41 billion.
