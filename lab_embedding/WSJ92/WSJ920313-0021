American Continental Suit
   By Bondholders Begins
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
As reported, Mr. Keating is one of several defendants in
the case who has said he won't present a defense. He claims
his insurance company has stopped paying some or all his
legal bills. He is awaiting sentencing on a California state
securities-fraud conviction related to the sales of corporate
bonds at branches of American Continental's former Lincoln
Savings  Loan Association unit in California. American
Continental filed for bankruptcy-court protection in April
1989, making the bonds almost worthless.
   On Monday and Tuesday, attorneys for seven of the
defendants, including the Arthur Andersen  Co., Ernst  and
Deloitte  Touche accounting firms and the Cleveland law firm
of Jones, Day, Reavis  Pogue, are scheduled to make opening
statements before federal Judge Richard Bilby.
