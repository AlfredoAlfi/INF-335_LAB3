U.S. Court Is Asked
   To Reconsider Suit
   Of Ex-Northrop Aide
The lawsuit was included as part of broader litigation
over the cruise missile, most of which was settled last year.
Last June, Northrop, a Los Angeles defense contractor, agreed
to pay nearly $9 million to settle a 1987 civil suit brought
by Mr. Barajas and another former employee, Patricia Meyer,
alleging that the company had falsified tests on the missile.
The Justice Department joined in that case.
   But that settlement didn't include charges over the
gyroscope fluid, which Northrop agreed to replace in the
missile fleet at no charge to the government. Herbert Hafif,
attorney for Mr. Barajas, had argued that Mr. Barajas brought
the low-temperature problem to the government's attention
and, therefore, should receive as much as 30% of whatever
value is placed on the modification program. The government
maintained that it learned of the fluid problem on its own
and, because of that and other reasons, Mr. Barajas isn't
entitled to any recovery.
