Business Brief -- Earth Technology Corp.:
   Concern Says It Had Loss
   In Fiscal Second Quarter
The laboratory was acquired by Pace Inc., a Minneapolis
operator of analytical laboratories, Earth Technology said.
Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
   The laboratory's performance has "consistently been a drag
on earnings and this has been exacerbated during the
recession," said Jack J. Schoustra, Earth Technology
chairman. The sale, "coupled with our exit from the asbestos
consulting business, positions the company for a return to
consistent profitability during the remainder of fiscal
1992."
