Rise in U.K. Unemployment
   Is Greater Than Expected
"It all adds to the case for having easier policy," said
David Walton, U.K. economist at Goldman Sachs International.
   The figures showed that the total number of jobless rose
by a seasonally adjusted 53,000 in January. This was well
above market forecasts for a rise of about 30,000. At the
same time, the number of new jobless in December was revised
upward to 36,200 from an initial estimate of 31,100.
   The unemployment rate as a whole rose to 9.2% from 9%,
with the unadjusted number of unemployed rising to nearly 2.7
million people.
   Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International,
said the data increase the chances that the total number of
unemployed will reach three million before the year is out.
   Prime Minister John Major told the House of Commons that
the figures were "a disappointment." The Treasury, however,
said, "It would be unrealistic to expect the increase to
moderate every month."
