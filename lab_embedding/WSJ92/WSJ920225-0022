International:
   Barclays Settles Claim
   Against Municipality
   For Pact Ruled Invalid
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Barclays wrote off #41 million ($71.4 million) in
interest-rate swap contracts entered into with various local
governments after various British courts moved to rule them
invalid. The charges applied to the bank's 1989 and 1990
accounts. Hammersmith  Fulham led local authorities in
petitioning to overturn the contracts, many of which would
have forced the governmental agencies to make substantial
payments.
   Barclays is scheduled to release its 1991 results
tomorrow. Analysts expect it to report a 16% drop in pretax
profit largely due to higher U.K. bad-debt charges.
   The swaps case drew widespread attention largely because
the courts ruled that municipal governments weren't legally
allowed to enter into such contracts and that they were
therefore invalid. Britain's highest court, the House of
Lords, however, allowed banks to negotiate individual
settlements with local authorities without fully overturning
the earlier rulings.
