EPA Bars American
   Management Systems
   From Federal Work
The disbarment notice alleged that the improper hiring
occurred from 1984 to August 1989.
   Patrick Gross, vice chairman of American Management, said
the company has proposed a settlement to the EPA that he
expects will lead to a lifting of the disbarment soon. He
said, "I don't expect this will have any adverse impact on
our business." About 25% of the company's business is with
the government.
   Disciplinary action, which wasn't disclosed, has been
taken against several EPA managers involved.
   The agency said that while officially working for the
consultant, the temporary people would do work assigned by
EPA managers and be supervised by them. When the paperwork
was complete they would became EPA employees, although often
their assignments wouldn't change.
   The EPA said American Management officials helped the
individuals submit fraudulent vouchers that contained
billings for hours that weren't worked and expenses that
weren't incurred.
   The Justice Department declined to pursue a criminal
prosecution.
