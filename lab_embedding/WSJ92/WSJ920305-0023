International Brief -- Swiss Bank Corp.:
   Firm Says 1991 Net Income
   Rose 25% to $682 Million
"In spite of the not exactly favorable economic and
political environment and our problems with specific loan
positions, which by now are all too familiar, we generated
record profits in 1991," Mr. Frehner said. "We even
outperformed the ambitious targets we had in our budget. For
the first time in Swiss Bank Corp.'s history, consolidated
net profit was more than one billion francs."
   SBC is the second of Switzerland's three leading banks,
after Union Bank of Switzerland, to report record 1991
results. Credit Suisse is expected to continue the trend when
it releases figures on Friday.
   The bank said it would pay an unchanged dividend of 14
francs a share.
