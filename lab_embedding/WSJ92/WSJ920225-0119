Pepper...and Salt
I'm an unorthodox player --
   I don't double my fist
   After winning a point
   That I should have missed;
   But what sets me apart
   From most in the game
   Is I don't stare at my racket
   As if it's to blame.

   Euphemisms are much in vogue.
   Now we are being told
   That we're "chronologically gifted"
   Instead of being called old.
