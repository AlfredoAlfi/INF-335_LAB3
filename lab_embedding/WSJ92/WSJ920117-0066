Business Brief -- Philips Electronics N.V.:
   Dutch Company Will Close
   Utah Plant by End of 1992
The Orem factory "has been a workhorse for many years, but
by today's standards, it is an almost outdated facility,"
said James E. Dykes, Signetics president. The plant was
opened in 1966.
   Mr. Dykes said Philips will act to ensure that there is no
interruption in supplies of semiconductors to its customers
during the transfer.
