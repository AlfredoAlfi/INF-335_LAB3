Business Brief -- Trimble Navigation Ltd.:
   Lower-Than-Expected Sales
   Lead to 4th-Quarter Loss
Charlie Trimble, president and chief executive officer,
said earnings were hurt when a large order expected from a
Mideast customer was never placed. He also said the company
recently cut salaries, up to 25% for its highest paid
employees, and implemented other cost-cutting measures.
   Mr. Trimble said he expected the company to become
profitable in the second quarter despite a drop in military
sales since the Persian Gulf War. Commercial sales, he said,
continue to soar and should rise to industry estimates of
$150 million in 1992, up 63% from $92 million in 1991.
Military sales in 1992 are expected to drop 38% to $36
million from $58 million, he said.
   For 1991, net rose to $7 million, or 40 cents a share,
from $2.2 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $151 million from $63.3 million.
