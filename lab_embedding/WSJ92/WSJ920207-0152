Australian Lamb Ad Campaign
Bruce Standen, managing director of Australian Meat 
Livestock Corp., said the campaign aims to establish "a more
positive image for Australian meat and livestock."
   Colin Mues, Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics research officer, said: "Australian exporters
appear to have improved their ability to meet age and animal
health specifications of Middle East importers, although a
veterinary protocol has yet to be negotiated with Saudi
Arabia."
   "A recovery in economic growth in the Middle East region
is also expected to contribute to increased live sheep
exports, and improved political stability in the region could
create a more stable trading environment," Mr. Mues said.
