   Continually Changing
   Face of Psychoanalysis
2. In current practice, psychoanalysis is never used for
the treatment of severe psychiatric disorders. It is not even
used for the treatment of depression. Rather, it is limited
to the treatment of (some) personality disorders. In your
contrast of drugs and therapy you do not make sufficient
distinction between psychotherapy and psychoanalysis.
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy (a misnomer incidentally --
typical psychotherapy is an eclectic combination of various
psychological theories integrated for the purpose of generic
practice) may be used as an alternative to drug therapy under
special circumstances.
