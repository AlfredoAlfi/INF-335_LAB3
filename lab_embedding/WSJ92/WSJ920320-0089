Credit Ratings:
   Long Island Lighting
   Debt of $5.7 Billion
   Is Upgraded by SP
The improved ratings reflect Lilco's prospects for gradual
financial improvement as it gets continuing rate relief,
savings in interest expense from refinancings, and regulatory
incentives for better earnings, SP said. Lilco, of
Hicksville, N.Y., refinanced about $1.3 billion of high-cost
debt and preferred last year, and more refinancing
opportunities could further enhance debt coverage ratios.
   Lilco's capital spending is expected to be only 55% to 60%
internally funded during the next two years, including
planned costs of decommissioning the Shoreham nuclear plant.
Financing requirements will limit the ability to reduce debt
levels from the current 64% of capitalization. Nevertheless,
SP said, internal cash generation should strengthen
considerably by the mid1990s as noncash credits are replaced
with cash under Lilco's rate agreement in connection with
closing Shoreham.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Lilco
declined 25 cents a share to $22.75.
