   Orbital Says Engine
   Shows Promise in Test
   By Ford and the EPA
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange last week,
Orbital said that a low-emission vehicle developed by Orbital
with funding and support from Ford was tested over 2,000
miles. The company said it "achieved emissions below the
levels contained in the stringent California standards,"
which are between two and 10 times lower than current U.S.
standards.
   Orbital is based in Australia, but it has a U.S. unit
based in Tecumseh, Mich.
   Orbital also said initial testing at the EPA's
laboratories in Ann Arbor, Mich., confirmed Ford's
measurement that the test vehicle approached the California
standard and achieved fuel economy that was 5% to 35% better
than a range of comparable 1992 U.S. vehicles.
