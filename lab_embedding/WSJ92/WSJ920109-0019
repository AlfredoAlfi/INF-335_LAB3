International Brief -- Daimler-Benz AG:
   Terms Sought by Mercedes
   In Czech Deal Are Assailed
Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, has made no secret it
wants tariff protections and other sweeteners during the
initial phase of the project. But company officials refused
to comment on the report, saying only that they had received
no official notification of any objections. Both sides have
agreed to make the venture contingent on government approval.
   Representatives of Mercedes and Avia signed a letter of
intent in Prague on Monday, declaring that they would work
toward establishing the joint venture by the middle of the
year. Mercedes has vowed to pour 350 million marks ($232
million) into updating the plant and would take an initial
stake of 31% in the venture.
