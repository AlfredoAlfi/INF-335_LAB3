Hong Kong Economy
   Continued to Expand
   During Third Quarter
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Growth for the year's first nine months stood at 3.8%,
helped by the brisk, 4.3% expansion of the first quarter.
   The government predicted in November that economic growth
for all of 1991 would hit 4%. The final figure isn't expected
to be announced until March.
   Chief factors fueling the third-quarter rise was a nearly
12% rise in fixed-capital formation, aided by a 24% surge in
plant, machinery and equipment.
   The implicit GDP price deflator, which is regarded by many
economists as a more meaningful gauge of inflation than the
more closely watched consumer price index, slipped to 9.8% in
the third quarter from 10.1% in the second quarter, well
below the 11%-12% annual CPI growth recorded over much of the
same period.
