International:
   Russia Hires Investigator
   To Track Assets Abroad
"We've been supplied lots of information and leads to go
on," said Jules Kroll, president of Kroll Associates, the
firm that was hired two weeks ago.
   The Russian assets are believed to include foreign
currencies that should have been converted to rubles by
Russian state enterprise units, Mr. Kroll said. But instead
of remitting 40% of profits for conversion to rubles as
required, the officials of the units set up bank accounts
outside the country. It's unclear whether the accounts were
meant to benefit the officials or their enterprises.
   "That kind of activity alone amounts to billions and
billions of dollars," Mr. Kroll said.
   Kroll also is seeking hidden assets of Iraq and its
leader, Saddam Hussein, on behalf of Kuwait. And it has
conducted searches for hidden assets of Ferdinand Marcos and
Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier on behalf of the governments
of the Philippines and Haiti.
