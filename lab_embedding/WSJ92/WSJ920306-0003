Marketing  Media:
   PolyGram's Earnings
   Rose by 24% in 1991
   With 19% Sales Gain
Now the third-largest record company in the world,
PolyGram has been strong in Europe for some time, but only
bolstered its presence in North America in the last several
years, buying two American record labels for $750 million in
1990. After an operating loss of $28.4 million in 1990,
PolyGram managed to turn in an operating profit of $7.6
million from North America last year.
   PolyGram's share of the recorded music market world-wide
rose to about 18.5% in 1991 from 17.5% the year before, said
Alain Levy, chief executive officer. In the U.S., he said,
the company has a market share of 11.5%, which rises to 13.5%
if Motown Records, now distributed by PolyGram, is included.
Mr. Levy has said he would like to reach a 14% market share
in the U.S., excluding distributed product.
   In addition to improvement in the U.S. market, Mr. Levy
said PolyGram's growth was above average in Germany and the
Far East.
   Analysts responded favorably to the results, which
exceeded most estimates. "Clearly, they've gained market
share in records and have impressive momentum at a time when
the music industry has been flat to down," said Harold Vogel,
entertainment analyst for Merrill Lynch.
