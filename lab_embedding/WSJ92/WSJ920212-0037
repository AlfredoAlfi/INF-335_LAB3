   60% Rise in 4th-Period Net
A spokeswoman said expenses grew at a much slower rate
than revenue. Increased stock and bond market activity
boosted assets under management, which were $76.6 billion at
Dec. 31, up from $62 billion at the end of 1990. Further, she
said, total assets have grown to nearly $83 billion since
Jan. 1. The company has also benefited from a gradual
phase-in of expense charges, begun in September, on some of
its funds. Before, she said, for some of these funds, Dreyfus
collected little or no expenses.
   For the year, Dreyfus reported net income of $67.9
million, or $1.77 a share, compared with $62.1 million, or
$1.56 a share. Revenue rose 8% to $282.3 million.
