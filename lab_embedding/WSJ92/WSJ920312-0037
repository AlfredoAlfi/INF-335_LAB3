U.S. Agency Forecasts
   Citrus Crop Will Rise
   7% From Last Year
The department forecast a 4% rise in the winter potato
crop to 272 million pounds. Producers in Florida were
reporting potato quality and size as being good. Spring
potato plantings, meanwhile, were estimated at 87,700 acres
this year, down 3% from a year ago.
   Separately, the department reported little change in
prospects for world and U.S. grain stocks. The department
expects U.S. wheat stocks to total only 390 million bushels
on June 1, the lowest level since 1974. U.S. corn stocks are
expected to total just over one billion bushels on Sept. 1,
the lowest since 1984. Both projections are unchanged from
previous forecasts. U.S. export and domestic-use estimates
for wheat and feed grains also are unchanged.
