Business Brief -- Fougerolle S.A.:
   French Construction Group
   Seeking Takeover of SAE
Fougerolle said it will offer 1,100 francs ($200) a share
for buyers who accept payment when the shares received in the
bid are settled, or 1,200 francs for those who accept payment
in a year. Cie. Financiere de Paribas -- Fougerolle's banker
-- and Fougerolle announced last year that together they held
about 20% of SAE. They also said at the time they weren't
planning a takeover. Now, Paribas and Fougerolle together
hold 28% of SAE.
   Fougerolle noted that it may not go through with the
takeover if it cannot acquire more than 50%. The bid must be
approved by French regulators before the takeover can
proceed.
   Fougerolle estimated SAE's 1991 revenue at 26.9 billion
francs, about the same as in 1990.
