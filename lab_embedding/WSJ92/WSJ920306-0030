How Poll Was Conducted
One registered voter was selected from each household by a
procedure to provide the correct number of male and female
respondents. The results of the survey were minimally
weighted by sex, race and income to assure that the poll
accurately reflects registered voters nationwide.
   Certain questions were asked of all respondents, and
others were asked of half. Among those questions asked of
everyone, chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters
with telephones in the U.S. had been surveyed, the findings
would differ from these poll results by no more than 3.2
percentage points in either direction. The margin of error
for questions asked of half the sample would be 4.5
percentage points. The margin for a subgroup would depend on
the size of that group.
