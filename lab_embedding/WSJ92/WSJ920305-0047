Japan Securities Industry
   Adopts New Payout Rules
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Companies now distribute an average of 22%-23% of their
after-tax profit as dividends, although about half of the
companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section
meet the 30% requirement.
   Highly profitable companies and fast-growing concerns will
be exempted from the new rules if their profit-to-capital
ratio stands at 8% or more and the dividend-to-capital ratio
comes to 2.4% or more.
   Separately, the Japan Securities Dealers' Association
announced rules to prevent stock manipulation resulting from
competition for underwriting jobs among securities companies.
   The association instructed securities companies that their
underwriting divisions cannot leak information regarding
scheduled new stock issues to their brokerage divisions.
