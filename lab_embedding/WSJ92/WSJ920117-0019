Business Brief -- Republic Gypsum Co.:
   Net Increased to $418,000
   In Fiscal Second Quarter
The Dallas-based maker of gypsum wallboard and paperboard
attributed the improved earnings to reduced administrative
and sales expenses, improved manufacturing and delivery
procedures, and the elimination of fixed expenses in
connection with the closing of a Kansas City, Kan.,
corrugated container facilty that had been operating at a
loss.
   A company spokeswoman said Republic Gypsum has
substantially reduced shipping costs by concentrating its
gypsum wallboard sales efforts in Texas and other markets
near its Duke, Okla., manufacturing facility. In addition,
sales personnel from the now-closed Kansas City facility are
concentrating on selling the company's paperboard products to
customers outside the recession-battered construction
industry, she said.
