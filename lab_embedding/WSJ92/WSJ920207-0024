Business Brief -- Mine Safety Appliances Co.:
   Maker of Health Equipment
   Expects Earnings to Plunge
While the Persian Gulf War stimulated demand for Mine
Safety's gas masks, the gains were offset by lower sales to
commercial customers, the company said. The company said its
profit margins on commercial sales are much larger than its
profit margins on military sales.
   For the year, Mine Safety expects net will drop 36% from
the year-earlier period's net of $29.2 million, or $4.50 a
share. Sales for the year will be up about 5% from last
year's sales of $474.1 million.
   Mine Safety said it expects to consolidate certain
production operations and cut its 3,000-member work force by
250 to 300 workers through layoffs and a voluntary early
retirement program. Costs for the restructuring won't have a
substantial impact on earnings, the company said.
