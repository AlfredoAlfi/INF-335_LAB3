Judge Orders FDIC
   To Repay Ex-Owners
   Of Far West Federal
William Black, counsel for the OTS, which had been a
defendant in the action, said the FDIC will likely appeal. A
representative of the FDIC was not available to comment.
   The plaintiffs had sought $130 million in damages, mostly
because of alleged improvements in the thrift's operations
and finances under their management. Judge Owen Panner said
he found "no evidence" the government got any benefit from
such improvements. The judge said he would set the exact
amount of restitution after further study.
   Mr. Nierenberg said he is "delighted" with the ruling but
hasn't decided whether to press his case for a higher amount
in damages.
   In an earlier ruling in the case, Judge Panner said that
the government did not have the power to force the thrift to
meet the tougher standards, as required by 1989 thrift reform
legislation, and thus had no right to seize it. That decision
was overturned on appeal last December.
