International Brief -- Esselte AB:
   Swedish Concern Posts Loss
   For Year After 1990 Profit
Esselte recorded the one-time costs in connection with
personnel reductions and plant closings. Without the
operating costs, Esselte would have had a pretax profit of
142 million kronor, about even with 1990's results, the group
said.
   Sales fell 2.6% in 1991 to 15.63 billion kronor from 16.05
billion kronor.
   "Esselte's result will improve significantly during 1992
due to the reduced costs and other . . . measures already
implemented," the group said. It added however, that the
recession is expected to hold down sales at least until the
fall.
   In the past year, Esselte cut its staff by 1,750
employees, to a total of about 17,500, and a further 1,200
job cuts are expected in 1992, Esselte said.
