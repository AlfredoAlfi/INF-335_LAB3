Money Funds' Assets
   Rose $31.02 Billion
   In the Latest Week
"True to the usual turn-of-the year pattern, money market
funds experienced a massive inflow of assets," said Dr. Jacob
Dreyer, vice president and chief economist for the institute.
"The $31 billion increase in assets of taxable money-market
funds in the first week of the new year makes up almost
entirely for the asset loss in the last three weeks of 1991.
Shifts in institutional portfolios accounted for three
quarters of the swing. The pattern among tax-exempt money
market funds was very much the same.
   "These large turn-of-the-year reversals of asset flows are
the consequence of various year-end portfolio adjustments by
institutional investors. They result in substitutions among
different classes of money and capital market instruments and
between those instruments and money-market funds," he added.
   Assets of money-market mutual funds for the week ended
Wednesday, Dec. 31, were revised, to $459.1 billion, and the
decrease was revised to $19.94 billion.
