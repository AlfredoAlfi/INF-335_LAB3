SEC Waives Reserves
   On Some Top Private
   Commercial Paper
Previously, the agency forced firms to hold reserves equal
to the amount of privately placed paper unless they could
prove that there was a ready market for the securities. That
put a burden on firms to show that they could sell their
securities. Few firms actually set aside 100% of their
holdings, instead preferring to go through the hassle of
demonstrating to the SEC capital examiners that they could
find buyers for the paper.
   After complaints from investment-banking firms and the
SIA, the industry's main trade group, the SEC decided that it
would rely on rating agencies to determine whether the paper
was of high quality, usually a sign that it is easily
marketable.
   The ruling now puts privately placed commercial paper on
an even footing with publicly traded paper, and could make
private paper more desirable than it is now. "Under the terms
of the letter, this makes privately placed paper as liquid as
publicly issued paper," and improves its attractiveness, said
Douglas Preston, an SIA lawyer.
