Northern Telecom Bans
   Furtive Monitoring of Staff
Northern Telecom, a Nashville, Tenn., manufacturer of
telecommunications gear, is a unit of Northern Telecom Ltd.,
Toronto. It doesn't employ many phone workers and hasn't been
a big practitioner of high-tech electronics monitoring.
   The ban may be part of a broader response to a 1990
lawsuit by the Communications Workers of America, charging
Northern Telecom with wiretapping calls to and from its plant
in Nashville. A CWA spokeswoman said the union expects the
suit to be settled within the next few weeks. The union has
sought, so far unsuccessfully, to organize Northern Telecom
workers in Nashville.
   A Northern Telecom spokeswoman said the new policy has no
connection with the lawsuit. She said the company didn't have
any comment on the lawsuit's charges.
