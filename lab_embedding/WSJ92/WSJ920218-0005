Chrysler Corp. Sells
   Up to $850 Million
   In Preferred Shares
Both Sandusky Vinyl and Seal/Dry make vinyl products.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed and Sandusky Vinyl
officials said that completing the sale is still several
months away.
   Chrysler declined to comment on the preferred stock
offering. Since the auto maker sold the stock only to a
limited number of major and institutional investors, it isn't
required to disclose details of the offering.
   But investors familiar with Chrysler's effort to raise
funds said the company ended up selling $750 million shares
of the preferred stock to investors. Up to another $100
million of the stock went to firms underwriting the offering.
First Boston Corp. and Morgan Stanley  Co. led the syndicate
behind the offering.
   Investors said Chrysler set a high 9.25% dividend yield on
the shares. Analysts said the shares also carry a 20%
premium, which is expected to make them worth about $18 a
share of common stock when they convert into common shares
after 1995.
   Chrysler closed Friday at $16.375, up $1.25, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Chrysler originally intended to sell $400 million of the
preferred stock, investors said. But demand proved so strong
that the company expanded the offering.
