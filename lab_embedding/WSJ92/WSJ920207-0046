International Brief -- Ing. C. Olivetti  Co.:
   Preliminary Loss Is Posted
   For Year of $243.9 Million
Olivetti said the final loss for the year could be more
than 290 billion lire if extraordinary charges linked to the
company's 1992 restructuring program are included. A
spokesman said directors are considering whether to allocate
other extraordinary charges to last year's budget.
   Olivetti said operating results were "close to break-even"
on sales of 8.6 trillion lire, down 4.8% from 9.036 trillion
lire in 1990. The company said it had reduced its debt from
744.5 billion lire at the end of 1990, "thanks to positive
cash flow," but declined to specify by how much.
