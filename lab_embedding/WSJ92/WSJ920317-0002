   Viacom's Showtime
   Plans Pay-TV Service
   With Lower Price
The pay-TV industry has been mired in a slump that began
about two years ago, with all pay services except the Disney
Channel reporting subscriber losses in the past year.
Research firm Paul Kagan Associates said 1991 was the worst
year for net subscriber growth for the six largest premium
services. Industry-wide, the number of premium services
bought edged up only 2.9% from the year before to 42.7
million.
   Showtime lost about 100,000 subscribers in 1991, dropping
to 7.3 million subscribers; the Movie Channel lost about
200,000 subscribers in 1991, posting 2.6 million subscribers,
according to Kagan estimates. Showtime's bigger rival, Time
Warner Inc.'s Home Box Office, saw its reach drop by about
290,000 homes to almost 17.3 million in the past year.
   Analysts say the recession has contributed to the
troubles, as customers shy away from pricier fare. "As prices
for basic cable have continued to increase, the premium
business has suffered," said McAdory Lipscomb Jr., a senior
vice president for Showtime. He said Showtime has advocated
giving cable operators price breaks on fees for the service
if they can increase the subscriber base.
