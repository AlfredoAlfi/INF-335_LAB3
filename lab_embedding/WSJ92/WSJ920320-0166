Letters to the Editor:
   The Smaller They Are
   The Better They Grow
Our most recent data illustrate this point. From 1988 to
1990 -- going into a period of economic contraction -- large
businesses, those with more than 500 employees, actually lost
some 501,000 employees. During the same period, small
businesses created 3,170,000 new jobs. Thus there was a net
loss of jobs in the big companies, while small businesses
created all the net new jobs from 1988 to 1990.
   In the near-term future, we also expect small business to
be an important source of new-job growth. Recent Small
Business Administration analysis of Bureau of Labor
Statistics figures indicates that 71% of future employment in
the fastest-growing industries (such as medical care,
business services and the environment) is likely to come from
small-business firms.
