Business Brief -- Dillard Department Stores Inc.:
   Christmas Sales Climbed 7%
   At Arkansas Retail Chain
The release of Christmas sales was unusual, because
Dillard, based in Little Rock, Ark., typically reports sales
figures only on a quarterly basis. But Wall Street anxiety
over Christmas sales had prompted a decline in the price of
Dillard stock, from $125 a share Jan. 3 to $116.75 a share
yesterday, when the price fell $4.75 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   It remains to be seen if the announcement, which followed
the close of the market, will halt the slide. Dillard's sales
are "below what I expected," said William Smith, a retail
analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham  Co.
   In early December Mr. Smith lowered his estimate for sales
gains at Dillard stores open more than a year from the high
single digits to 4%.
   Dillard officials weren't available for comment.
