Business Brief -- Henley Group Inc.:
   Proposed Cash Distribution
   Is Raised to $256.5 Million
As reported, 8.5 million common shares of Fisher
Scientific, a former Henley Group subsidiary, were sold last
December in an initial public offering. Henley Group, a maker
of aerospace and industrial products, is based in Hampton,
N.H.
   The distribution is part of a proposed recapitalization
plan that calls for Henley Group to spin off to shareholders
its Pneumo Abex manufacturing subsidiary, which would become
a public company, and merge the remaining Henley assets with
Henley Properties Inc., a unit of Henley Group that was spun
off in 1989.
