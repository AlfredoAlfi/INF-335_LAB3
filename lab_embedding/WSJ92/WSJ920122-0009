   IBM Unveils Models
   For RS/6000 Family
The announcement gives IBM a credible entry in the low end
of the market. Sun Microsystems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
can still undercut IBM on price at the very low end, where
workstations are sold with monochrome monitors and without
hard disks. But most customers go for color screens and big
hard disks, and IBM's two new models, at $8,475 and $9,995,
are competitive in that range.
   Bill Filip, who runs IBM's workstation business, said the
low-end models could account for 20% to 25% of the $2.4
billion in revenue IBM has indicated it expects to generate
from workstations this year. The models could account for 25%
to 50% of the units, he added. He said that these models put
him in competition with personal computers for the first time
and that he would continue to encroach on their territory.
   IBM, which has projected a 50% increase in workstation
revenue this year, could do at least that well next year, Mr.
Filip said. He said IBM must if it is to reach its goal of
market-share leadership some time in 1993.
   Mr. Filip said he will have a series of smaller
announcements in 1992, increasing performance across the
product line, and might even have an announcement as broad as
yesterday's. He wouldn't elaborate.
