Computer Associates
   Countersues GM Unit
   Over Software Pacts
Earlier this month, EDS filed a suit in Dallas federal
court against Computer Associates charging breach of contract
and misuse of copyright. EDS has licensing agreements that
allow it to use some of Computer Associates' software, and
the dispute centers on these agreements.
   Computer Associates in its counterclaim filed yesterday in
Dallas federal court, accuses EDS of fraud, breach of
computer software contracts, copyright infringements and
misappropriation of trade secrets. "We are talking about EDS
schemes and practices that should enrage the entire computer
industry," said Belden Frease, attorney for Computer
Associates.
   An EDS spokesman said the amount of damages being sought
by Computer Associates is "frivolous and unrealistic because
we do less than $15 million a year in business with them." A
GM spokesman said the company doesn't comment on matters in
litigation.
