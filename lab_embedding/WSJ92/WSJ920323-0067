Judge to Conduct Inquiry
   Into House Bank Scandal
Judge Wilkey will be taking over an inquiry announced last
week by the U.S. attorney here. Mr. Barr said he was
assigning the work instead to a special counsel because of
"the unique circumstances and sensitivities of this matter."
In a statement issued by his office, Mr. Barr added that the
switch "does not reflect any escalation of the Justice
Department effort or any change in the nature of the
inquiry."
   Judge Wilkey served on the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington for 15 years, until he retired in 1984. From 1985
to 1990 he was ambassador to Uruguay and during that time he
also served as chairman of the President's Commission on
Reform of Federal Ethics Laws.
