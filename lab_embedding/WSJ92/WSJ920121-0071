Letters to the Editor:
   The Old Stores, Gone Forever
In the end, my father paid everyone he could, found jobs
for many of his employees, and closed his business with
dignity and with the respect of his community and his
profession.
   No discount chain can ever replace the attributes of
service, quality and caring that were the credo of Marmer's
Shoes for 62 years. My heart goes out to the Greenbergs and
the many other family retailers who have faced the vacant
storefront. Something of value for all of us is being lost.

   Richmond, Va.'s loss of its major downtown store,
Thalhimers, will recall to thousands of newly commissioned
World War II second lieutenants that it was the place where
they got their officer's uniforms.
   I understand Thalhimers had outfitted Confederate officers
in the War Between the States.
   Goodbye, Thalhimers.
