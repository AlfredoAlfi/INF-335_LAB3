Business Brief -- BASF AG:
   Unit Lost $143.2 Million
   In First Year of Operation
Mannheim-based BASF Magnetics was established Jan. 1,
1991, by consolidating all the BASF group's video and
magnetic tape operations and includes the AGFA Magnetband
subsidiary that BASF acquired from Germany's Bayer AG last
year.
   Volker Trautz, the new chairman of BASF Magnetics,
attributed the large loss to stagnating world demand for
magnetic tape and unexpected difficulties arising from the
establishment of BASF's magnetics business as a separate unit
and the integration of AGFA Magnetband.
   Trautz said BASF Magnetics should register a small sales
increase in 1992 from 1.5 billion marks in 1991. But he said
that its 1992 earnings will still suffer from extraordinary
charges. Only in 1993 does the company expect to turn a
profit, Rautz said.
