International:
   Russian Packaging Venture
Tetra Pak agreed to become a 50% owner in Kuban, a Russian
packaging company owned by a cooperative with the same name
in southern Russia.
   Tetra Pak Kuban will make and market packaging products
for such foodstuffs as milk, juice, vegetables, meat and
fruits.
   Tetra Pak, a major producer of drink boxes, said the
venture would alleviate the pressing supply problems in the
new Commonwealth of Independent States.
   "Studies show that 60% of the food produced {in the former
Soviet Union} never reaches consumers because of the weak
state of the packaging and distribution network," a company
official said.
