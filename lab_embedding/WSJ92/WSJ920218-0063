International Brief -- Canon Inc.:
   Concern Reports 3.9% Rise
   In Pretax Profit for 1991
Despite the gain in sales, pretax profit was squeezed by
the yen's appreciation against the dollar and mark compared
with the previous year, a Canon spokesman said. Canon depends
on exports for 76% of its overall sales.
   Canon forecasts that in the six months ending June 30 its
unconsolidated pretax profit will inch up to 38.5 billion yen
from 38.17 billion yen in the same period a year earlier. Net
income for the half is expected to reach 22.5 billion yen, up
2.2% from 22.01 billion yen. Sales are seen at 560.0 billion
yen, a gain of 7.3% from 521.82 billion yen.
   The pretax profit represents operating profit plus
nonoperating profit including financial income and expenses.
Net income represents pretax profit plus extraordinary gains
or losses and payments of taxes.
   Unconsolidated results are those of the parent alone.
Consolidated results include those of subsidiaries.
