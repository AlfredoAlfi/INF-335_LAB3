   To Develop Electric Vehicle
Chrysler claims the alternating-current engine will permit
acceleration to 60 miles per hour from zero in less than 15
seconds and will have a maximum range of 200 miles while
driving at "normal highway speeds."
   The electric minivan that Chrysler will continue to
develop uses a direct-current motor that reaches 60 mph in 25
seconds and has a range of 120 miles.
   General Motors Corp.'s Impact electric car also employs an
alternating-current engine. GM claims its car reaches 60 mph
in eight seconds and has a maximum range of 120 miles while
maintaining a 55-mph pace. Nissan Motor Co.'s FEV electric
vehicle gets to 60 mph in 18 seconds and has a range of 100
miles at a constant speed of 45 mph.
