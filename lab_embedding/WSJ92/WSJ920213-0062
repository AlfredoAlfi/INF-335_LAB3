Business Brief -- American Power Conversion Corp.:
   Pact to Build New Facility
   Set With Providence, R.I.
As part of the letter of intent, Providence agreed to
provide a $2.1 million grant for machinery and equipment.
American Power said the new facility will cost a total of $5
million to build, and will bring as many as 300 jobs
immediately. In the next 30 months, employment at the plant
and its surrounding facilities will reach 1,000, Providence
officials said.
   "This announcement comes at an opportune time," said
Providence Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., "as Electric Boat
faces layoffs, the unemployment rate in Providence nears 9%,
and as many of our residents start to believe our economy is
sinking like a stone."
