Business Brief -- TransTechnology Corp.:
   Firm Agrees to Sell Division
   To Recognition Equipment
Mr. Berthelot said the sales reflect the company's focus
on industrial components and machine parts since its
announced restructuring last year. For the nine months ended
Dec. 29, 1991, TransTechnology reported a loss of $5.9
million, or $1.16 a share, on revenue of $120 million.
   The company declined to identify the potential buyers of
its textile machinery and weather instrument divisions. It
said the sale to Recognition Equipment, a maker of remittance
processing equipment, is expected to close this month.
