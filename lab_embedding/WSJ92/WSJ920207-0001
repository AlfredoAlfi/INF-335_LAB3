Resolution Trust Sues
   KPMG Peat Marwick
   And Mortgage Broker
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Attorneys for KPMG and Blackman couldn't be reached for
comment.
   One suit alleges that mortgage broker Blackman brought
Gibraltar a series of real estate deals that weren't properly
analyzed despite their high risks. The projects included a
shopping center in Corte Madera, Calif., and a hotel in
Dallas, the suit says.
   The complaint against KMPG alleges that the accounting
firm failed to use generally accepted accounting standards in
approving Pacific's financial reports between 1982 and 1986.
Among other things, KPMG allegedly improperly allowed Pacific
to maintain inflated values for assets on its books while
providing inadequate loss reserves.
   KMPG also allowed the recording of excessive gains for the
sale of branch offices and improperly treated real-estate
investments as loans rather than as investments, the suit
alleges.
   One result of KMPG's negligence was that it said Pacific
was meeting required minimum asset values when, in fact, the
company's "regulatory accounting principle" assets were
almost depleted, according to the suit. The alleged
negligence was said to have been a major factor in Pacific's
insolvency.
