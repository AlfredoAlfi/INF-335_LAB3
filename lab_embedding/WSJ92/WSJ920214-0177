Pepper...and Salt
Wine tasting can be such a chore --
   Winetasters a colossal bore.
   Full, crisp, flowery, dry,
   Oaky nose, fresh, they cry,
   As they swirl, sniff, spit, pour out some more.

   Flawed Romance
                                                                                                       

   Making love is beautiful
   When done in terms endearing,
   But romance dies when it becomes
   Genetic engineering.
