Business Brief -- AB Volvo:
   Talks on Buying Procordia
   To Be Finished by May 12
He also said Volvo was considering postponing its annual
meeting from April 29 until May 20 to allow Volvo holders the
opportunity to see how Procordia holders react to the outcome
of the talks.
   Volvo and the Swedish state each hold a stake equivalent
to 42.7% of the voting rights in Procordia and a complicated
shareholders' agreement governs the ownership arrangement.
   Procordia made a surprise takeover bid for Volvo on Jan.
25, with the two groups to be merged under the Volvo name.
The government rejected the proposal, saying the reverse
takeover offer of nine Procordia shares for every four Volvo
shares was "a bad deal for the Swedish taxpayer."
   The Swedish market also reacted coolly to the bid, with
Volvo B unrestricted shares currently trading at levels under
its closing level of 393 kronor Jan. 24, the day before the
bid was made public.
