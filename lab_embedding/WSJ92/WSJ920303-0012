Business Brief -- W.R. Grace  Co.:
   Company Proposes to Buy
   Rest of Grace Energy Corp.
The specialty chemicals concern, which is based in Boca
Raton, Fla., said completion of the transaction is subject to
various conditions, including approval by a committee of
independent members of Grace Energy's board and a definitive
agreement.
   As previously reported, Grace said it would divest itself
of "non-strategic businesses," including Grace Energy. But to
achieve Grace's world-wide strategy of focusing on its core
businesses, Grace said, it needs the flexibility to execute
its program, and "this flexibility can't be realized so long
as Grace Energy, a non-strategic business to Grace, continues
to be a publicly traded company."
