   Looks Bad on Paper,
   Not So Bad in Reality
Furthermore, many Japanese investments have shown
extraordinary success even in these difficult times. For
example, Mitsui Fudosan recently constructed the Sanwa Bank
Tower in downtown Los Angeles. Although the current vacancy
rate in the downtown market is more than 20%, the Sanwa Bank
Tower is 90% leased less than one year after opening.
   Japanese investors have suffered paper losses on their
real-estate investments, but this is not unique to the
Japanese. The entire U.S. real-estate market has been
devalued 20% to 30%. I think if you research this issue
further, you will find that American investors (particularly
U.S. commercial banks) have suffered far worse than Japanese
investors. For example, Citicorp recently reported a
write-down of real-estate investments.
