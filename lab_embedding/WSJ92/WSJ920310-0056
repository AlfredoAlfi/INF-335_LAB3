   Lotus Will Unveil a CD
   Of Software, Help Features
Compact disks for computer information have been slow
sellers, because few PCs are equipped with CD players, which
cost $400 to $900, and because computer users can't store
their own data on the disks. Lotus said its disks can work
over networks or be bought by individuals. In addition to CD
players, customers would need to equip their personal
computers with speakers so that they can hear the advice
SmartHelp gives.
   Early users say the product is useful, Lotus offcials
said. "Businesses can understand the payback of getting
people to learn more about the software they've purchased,"
said Rob Lippincott, director of product development for
Lotus's Multimedia products group.
   The compact disk includes a 40-minute animated "guided
tour" of 1-2-3 for Windows, special two-minute animated clips
describing features that the user can watch in the middle of
working and procedural animations that describe tasks
step-by-step. It also includes all the text of the manuals so
that they can be quickly searched by the computer.
   The product will go on sale in the second quarter.
