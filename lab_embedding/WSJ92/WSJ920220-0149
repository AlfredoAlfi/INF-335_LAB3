Who's News:
   Sears Roebuck, Its Eye
   On Home Depot Inc.,
   Gives Stern New Post
In the home-improvement post, Mr. Stern succeeds William
E. Patterson, 45, who resigned. Sears has been using the
Brand Central approach to expand its selection to include
other brands besides its Craftsman tools and Weatherbeater
paints, but the conversion is far from complete. Moreover,
Sears faces increasing pressure from the Home Depot chain.
   Martin E. Hanaka, a 42-year-old regional manager in
Memphis, Tenn., will succeed Mr. Stern as vice president of
home appliances and electronics.
