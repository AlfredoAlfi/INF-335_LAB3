Business Brief -- Source Perrier S.A.:
   Chairman Denounces Bid
   By Nestle, Backs Agnelli
Mr. Vincent defended the entry of Italy's Agnelli group as
well as its ally Saint Louis, a French food group, in the
battle for control of Perrier. These operations, he affirmed,
"haven't disturbed the market equilibrium in French mineral
water."
   Mr. Vincent said the Nestle bidders intend to break up the
French mineral water group and partition the assets between
Nestle and BSN S.A., a leading French food group. Nestle has
said it would sell Perrier's Volvic water operations to BSN
if its bid succeeds. Volvic represents roughly 20% of the
Perrier water output.
