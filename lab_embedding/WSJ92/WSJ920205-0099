Business Brief -- Banamex:
   Hernandez Group Completes
   Purchase of Mexico's Stake
Meanwhile, Banamex officials said the Hernandez group has
also purchased nearly all the remaining Banamex shares which
trade on the "bolsa," as the stock exchange is called.
   Analysts speculated that Mr. Hernandez is backed by newly
returned flight capital. A Banamex spokesman said Mr.
Hernandez now has some 5,000 investors behind him. At the
time of the August sale of the government's part of Banamex,
the number was estimated at 800.
   "This may reflect a preference to be in Mexican assets
rather than U.S. dollars," said a Mexican economist, pointing
to the sluggish U.S. economy.
