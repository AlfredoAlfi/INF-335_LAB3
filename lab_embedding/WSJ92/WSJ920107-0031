Baker Hughes to Buy
   Sonat Services Unit
   For Up to $360 Million
The preferred stock is convertible at $32.50 a share of
Baker Hughes common stock, subject to adjustment at closing.
Baker Hughes said that at the current share price for its
common stock, the preferred stock has an indicated market
value of between $140 million and $160 million. Baker Hughes
currently has about 138.4 million common shares outstanding.
   The royalties are payable on revenue from Teleco's
directional and formation evaluation measurement system. A
Baker Hughes spokesman said the system is useful when
drilling deviates from the initial vertical hole, especially
in increasingly common horizontal drilling projects. The
system provides feedback to the driller on the exact location
of the drill bit and other information about the formation
during the drilling process, the spokesman said.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Baker
Hughes shares rose 37.5 cent to $20.50, and Sonat shares fell
25 cents to $35.50.
