Transamerica Expects
   Fourth-Quarter Loss
   Totaling $80 Million
The company added that it expects its ongoing
commercial-finance lines to be profitable in 1992 and that
its other businesses are performing well.
   Transamerica had net income of $28.7 million, or 32 cents
a share, in the 1990 fourth quarter. The company's latest
announcement was made after the stock market closed.
   In the first nine months of 1991, Transamerica had a loss
of $62.9 million on its commercial-lending business, after
profit of $28.3 million a year earlier. A Transamerica
spokesman said the national recession has hit its rental
finance business hard. The company financed operations that
leased home appliances and furnishings to low-income and
middle-income customers.
