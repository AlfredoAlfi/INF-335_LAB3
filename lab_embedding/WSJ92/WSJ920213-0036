Business Brief -- Presidio Oil Co.:
   Half of a Unit's Business
   Will Be Sold to a Fund
The agreement calls for an additional payment of $5
million if Mountain Gas meets certain performance conditions
in 1992. Presidio said it will use proceeds from the sale to
pay down its bank debt.
   Other energy companies have taken similar steps recently
to raise cash for reducing debt. The fortunes of gas
gathering systems generally aren't directly tied to natural
gas prices, which have been very low. Earlier this week,
Phillips Petroleum Co. said it would offer 51% of its gas
pipelines business to the public.
