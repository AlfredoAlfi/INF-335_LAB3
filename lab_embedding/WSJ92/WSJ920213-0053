Mr. Shacknai said that drug, which will undergo clinical
trials in the U.S. this year, has been tested in Canada and
Germany, where its use resulted in hair growing back in up to
85% of those treated for alopecia areata. The malady is
believed to to be an autoimmune disease, in which hair
follicles are suppressed. It affects about 1% of the U.S.
population. Those affected could have small bald spots or
loss of all body hair. Sometimes it grows back, often in odd
colors, only to fall out again.
   The drug minoxidil has shown some success in treating
common inherited baldness, but treating severe cases of
alopecia areata has been problematic.
