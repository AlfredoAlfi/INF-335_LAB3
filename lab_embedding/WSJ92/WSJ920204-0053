Business Brief -- Commercial Federal Corp.:
   Some Mortgage Servicing
   Is Sold to Detroit Concern
In the year-earlier third quarter, Commercial Federal
earned $14.9 million, or $2.05 a share, after a gain of $20.2
million on the sale of securities.
   Commercial Federal, the parent of Commercial Federal Bank,
a savings bank, said the move is part of a continuing effort
to bolster its capital position and to meet and exceed its
capital targets.
   The company said the actual transfer of servicing is
scheduled to take place in April. Upon completion of the
transfer, Commercial Federal's total portfolio of mortgage
loans serviced for itself and others will be $4.7 billion.
