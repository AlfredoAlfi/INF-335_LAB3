Business Brief -- Berry Petroleum Co.:
   Company Buys Some Assets
   From Atlantic Richfield Co.
"Their {Arco's} corporate goals and ours are different,"
says Harvey L. Bryant, Berry Petroleum's chief executive
officer. "We still want to pursue the Rincon development.
They don't." An Arco spokesman said: "We had a large
commitment in a project with a small payout."
   Berry Petroleum will acquire several properties in the
Midway-Sunset Field in Kern County, Calif., representing
about 4% of Arco's current production in that field.
   Berry said the acquisition would increase its current
production to about 12,000 barrels a day from about 10,000
barrels a day and boost proven reserves to about 80 million
barrels from 74 million.
