Who's News:
   Zapletal Quits Post
   At Cadbury Schweppes
Succeeding him is David I.G. Matthews, 56, managing
director of Cadbury Beverages Canada.
   Mr. Zapletal is the second senior beverage executive to
leave Cadbury since it moved its global beverage headquarters
and 10 senior executives from Connecticut to London in July.
The move prompted James P. Schadt, president of the global
beverage division, to resign rather than move overseas. He
has since become president and chief operating officer of
Reader's Digest Association Inc. A Cadbury spokeswoman said
that the beverage headquarters move hadn't caused other
executives to resign.
