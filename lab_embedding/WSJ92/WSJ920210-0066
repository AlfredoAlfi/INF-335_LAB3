Cuba Rejects ATT Plan
   To Improve Phone Service
ATT has replaced an undersea cable between the two
countries that wore out in 1987. As a temporary measure,
pending final agreement on terms for use of the new cable, a
radio telephone link has been used but it, too, has been
wearing out.
   The breakdown in the negotiations means continued
difficulty for Cuban exiles in the Miami area in talking with
friends and relatives in Cuba.
   Mr. Cavanagh said that of about 60 million attempts to
call Cuba from Miami annually, only about 500,000 are
successful, or less than one in 100. The new cable also would
improve the quality of the calls.
