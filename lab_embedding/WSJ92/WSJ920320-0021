Business Brief -- Adobe Systems Inc.:
   Lawsuit Alleging Inflation
   Of Share Price Is Dismissed
Adobe disputed the allegations and was sued by several law
firms specializing in investor class actions. Attorneys for
the plaintiffs said they expect to appeal.
   In her ruling, Judge Armstrong said the plaintiffs' case
was based in part on a "host of muddled and hypothetical
speculations" about the amount of royalties Adobe received in
fiscal 1990 from three of its "significant" customers: NEC
Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co.
   John Warnock, Adobe's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the case "demonstrates that companies do not
have to automatically settle when they are the target of
class-action securities litigation."
