Credit Ratings:
   Long-Term Ratings
   Of Two Swedish Banks
   Are Lowered by SP
SP said its actions reflect the ongoing deterioration of
the banks' asset quality due to the continuing economic
recession in their operating environment. It added that it is
"likely" that the downturn will cause further weakness in the
property sector as well as others, prolonging the asset
quality problems of both banks for "at least" the next two
years.
   Separately, SP placed Industrikredit AB's double-A
long-term debt rating and A-1 plus Eurocommercial paper
ratings on Creditwatch with negative implications. About
$172.7 million of debt is affected. It said that despite
historically strong asset quality, it expects the bank's core
lending sectors to be affected by the downturn in Sweden.
