   Is Ordered to Cooperate
   In Insider Trading Case
The ring traded on information regarding some major
acquisitions, relying on information supplied by a corporate
takeover lawyer at the big firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher  Flom.
   Jonathan Rosenberg, the assistant U.S. attorney handling
the case, said that the former Skadden attorney, Steven L.
Glauberman, passed on information about two dozen
transactions from 1984 to 1988. Mr. Glauberman has pleaded
guilty to insider trading and is awaiting sentencing.
   Mr. Glauberman allegedly gave the information to Eben
Putnam Smith, who was a broker at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
 Co. Mr. Rosenberg said Mr. Smith has been indicted on
insider trading charges but has yet to enter a plea.
