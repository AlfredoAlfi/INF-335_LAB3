Officials of Phoenix, which buys long-distance phone
service in bulk from major carriers at large discounts,
weren't available to elaborate. In the company's statement,
founder and Chairman Tom Bell said, "We wish Marc well in his
future endeavors."
   The company was profitable in the third quarter after a
string of losses, and analysts said sales have been going up
on an increased customer base.
