Business Brief -- Dana Corp.:
   Concern Agrees to Sell Unit
   And Business to Banc One
Details of the agreement weren't disclosed, but a Dana
spokesman said the company isn't expecting to record a
substantial gain or loss from the transaction.
   The move takes Dana out of the financial services business
with the exception of its leasing business, which Dana said
it plans to keep. Dana, whose principal business is making
auto parts, said in August it had signed a letter of intent
to sell Diamond Savings to Banc One.
