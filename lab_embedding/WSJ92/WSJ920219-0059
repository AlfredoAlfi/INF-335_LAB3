Business Brief:
   Federal Express Signs
   Pact With TNT Unit
   To Share Cargo Space
Neither company would give financial details. Robert Dahl,
a senior associate with Air Cargo Management Group, a Seattle
consulting firm, estimated that the agreement would yield no
more than $10 million a year for Federal but would carry
little added cost.
   According to a statement from Federal, TNT will fly
packages from its hub in Cologne, Germany, to Stansted,
England, where they will be loaded onto Federal's regularly
scheduled DC-10 to New York. TNT, which is based in Sydney,
Australia, will handle the packages once they arrive, said
Federal, which added that TNT will also use space on
Federal's flight from New York to the U.K.
   Federal declined to comment yesterday on whether talks
with TNT are continuing; a TNT Express Worldwide official
said last week that its talks with the rival air-express
concern were limited to sharing trans-Atlantic cargo space.
