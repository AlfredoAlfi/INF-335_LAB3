Technology Brief -- Marsam Pharmaceuticals Inc.:
   FDA Allows Generic Drug
   Sales of A.H. Robins Brand
Methocarbamol is currently sold by A.H. Robins Co., a unit
of American Home Products Corp., under the Robaxin Injectable
brand name, Marsam said.
   Marvin Samson, president and chief executive officer of
Marsam, said the U.S. market for the drug is very small,
about $1 million annually. He said a generic company could
generally expect to see sales of about 15% of the current
market for a branded drug.
