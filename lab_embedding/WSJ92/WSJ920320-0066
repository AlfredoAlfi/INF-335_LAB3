Chief Tax-Writers
   Meet to Negotiate
   On Bill by Democrats
Democratic congressional leaders hope to have a compromise
in hand for House and Senate votes today, the deadline that
President Bush set in January for an economic measure. But
the president has vowed to veto whatever bill Congress sends
him, on grounds that the tax cuts would be paid for by higher
taxes on high-income Americans.
   Judging from the close votes by which both the House and
Senate originally passed their tax bills, Congress probably
couldn't muster the two-thirds margin needed to override a
veto. Some insiders even question whether the emerging
House-Senate compromise can pass. "That's a big `if,"' Senate
GOP leader Robert Dole of Kansas said yesterday.
   Top Democratic Senate aides predict a package will pass
there. But in the House, where Democratic leaders are reeling
from the bounced-check scandal, vote-counters are uneasy.
