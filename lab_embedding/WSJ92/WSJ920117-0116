Money Funds' Assets
   Rose by $9.19 Billion
   During Latest Week
"Once again, institutional money-market funds accounted
for most of the change in total money-market fund assets,"
said Jacob S. Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at
the institute. "The big inflow occurred despite a substantial
drop in yields.
   "Managers of institutional portfolios, anticipating
further easing of yields on direct money-market instruments
of very short maturities, sought to lock in the yield
advantage inherent in the slight lengthening of money-market
fund portfolios," Dr. Dreyer said. "The slide in bond prices
over the last week provided an additional motivation to
switch some monies out of bond portfolios and into money
markets.
   Assets of money-market mutual funds for the week ended
Jan. 9 weren't revised.
