Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 48.8% involved
stock-index arbitrage, down from 52% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 57.3% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 36.2%
involved trading for customers. An additional 6.5% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most active firms, three did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities, Susquehanna
Investment Group and First Boston.
