Business Brief -- Coca-Cola Co.:
   Concentrate Plant in Ireland
   To Be Expanded, Firm Says
The expansion at the Irish plant will allow Coca-Cola to
supply more concentrate to growing markets including Eastern
Europe, the Middle East and parts of Africa, a spokeswoman
said.
   The company also said it created Coca-Cola Reinsurance
Services Ltd., in Dublin, to provide property reinsurance for
its holdings outside the U.S. and Canada. The spokeswoman
said Coca-Cola opted to create its own reinsurance company
because it was "more economical" than using an outside
concern.
