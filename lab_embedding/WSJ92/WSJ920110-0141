Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 52% involved
stock-index arbitrage, down from 53.1% in the prior week. In
this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index
options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 50.5% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 43% involved
trading for customers. An additional 6.5% was executed by
firms using principal positions to facilitate customer
trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities and Susquehanna
Investment Group.
