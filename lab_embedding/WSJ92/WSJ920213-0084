Florida Legislators
   Pass Budget; Governor
   Threatens to Veto It
Without new taxes, the deficit for fiscal 1993, which
begins July 1, is expected to total about $1 billion for the
same services now being provided in Florida, the
fastest-growing large state.
   Late Tuesday, the state House and Senate passed separate
versions of spending plans. They are beginning to iron out
differences in a conference committee. The plans would limit
spending for, among other services, education and law
enforcement.
   But Gov. Chiles, a Democrat and former U.S. senator, said
yesterday that he will veto the Legislature's budget.
   The governor, who has proposed a $31.8 billion budget
package, characterized the legislature's plan as a "giant
step backward for the state." He is calling for businesses
within Florida, many of which pay no corporate taxes, to help
alleviate the revenue crunch.
