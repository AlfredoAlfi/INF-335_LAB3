Business Brief -- Manville Corp.:
   New Credit Line to Replace
   Current $159 Million Facility
Manville said the new facility, which Morgan Guaranty will
arrange, also will be a backup credit line to give the
building and paper products company access to additional
liquidity. Because it will be tied to Manville's receivables,
the new line is expected to have more favorable terms; it
will be arranged next month.
   Separately, Manville's Riverwood International Corp. unit
said it expects to spend $11 million to add recycling
capacity to its West Monroe, La., paper mill. The expansion
will allow the paper and packaging concern to make beverage
carriers with up to 20%-recycled materials.
