Fiat Says Agreement
   With Polish Car Firm
   `Is Moving Ahead'
The two auto groups are negotiating the sale of a 51%
stake in the Polish auto maker to Fiat.
   "We are perfecting the accord," Mr. Romiti told
journalists after the meeting. "And I'd say their interest is
significant, as is ours."
   The Polish plant, located near Bielsko Biala, has been
making Fiat's small 126 models since the early 1970's under
license. More recently, Fiat has invested some 900 million
Deutsche marks ($557.3 million) in the plant for production
of a new line of subcompact models for sale in Poland and for
export to Western Europe.
   Mr. Romiti also said that Fiat isn't entertaining any more
hopes of negotiating an agreement with another Polish car
maker, Fabryka Samachodow Osobowych. "FSO is out of the
picture, now we want to focus on negotiating for FSM," he
said. FSO is expected to sign an accord with General Motors
Corp. of the U.S.
