Business Brief -- Philadelphia Electric Co.:
   Unsolicited Job Applications
   No Longer to Be Accepted
Last year, for instance, the company received more than
7,000 applications to fill about 150 positions with external
candidates.
   From now on, the company periodically will announce
specific openings, as well as requirements and application
instructions, on a telephone Job Hot-Line. Jobs will be
posted for one or two weeks.
   The company also said a current audit by federal contract
compliance officials had "uncovered a number of potential
record-keeping and legal problems associated with the current
practice of accepting the high volume of unsolicited
applications."
   A spokesman added that "there are not going to be that
many open positions in the foreseeable future" at the
company.
