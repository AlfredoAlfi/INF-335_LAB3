   Plans to Restructure
   Terms of Leases, Loan
The new agreement, expected to take effect in July, is
contingent on the company arranging by May 31 new financing,
either through additional loans or equity. John Capps, chief
financial officer, said the amount of the new financing
hasn't yet been determined.
   The restructuring plan calls for a reduction retroactive
to Oct. 1, 1991, in the cost of financing to 12% a year from
an implicit average rate of over 21%, as well as an extension
of the final maturity of the obligations to Dec. 31, 1995.
The leases and loan had varying maturities up to 1995.
   The company also reported that losses for the fourth
quarter widened to $9.7 million, or $1.23 a share, from $5.7
million, or 72 cents a share. Results for the latest quarter
included a $5.5 million reserve for the settlement of a
class-action shareholder suit arising out of In-Store's
initial public offering in July 1990.
   Revenue, meanwhile, rose to $5 million from $3.6 million.
In-Store said the revenue increase was offset by the cost of
expanding its network to 5,000 stores from 3,600 at the end
of 1990.
