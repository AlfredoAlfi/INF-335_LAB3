Sales in the quarter declined about 12% to $9.77 billion
from $11.06 billion.
   Among the major after-tax charges in the most recent
quarter, $537 million was for restructuring and cost
reduction, and $175 million was for the recall of Benlate
fungicide. The quarterly results also reflected an after-tax
gain of $152 million from the sale of a 50% interest in the
company's Consolidation Coal division.
   For the year, Du Pont reported net income of $1.40
billion, or $2.08 a share, compared with a profit of $2.31
billion, or $3.40 a share, in 1990. Sales slipped about 3% to
$38.70 billion from $40.05 billion.
   Du Pont said that cost-cutting steps currently under way
should position it to benefit when the economy improves. In
fact, fourth-quarter selling and general and administrative
expenses declined 20% from a year earlier.
   Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "we believe the underlying operating strengths
of our businesses and benefits from cost-reduction programs
put us in position to gain full advantage from resumption of
growth in the world-wide market place."
