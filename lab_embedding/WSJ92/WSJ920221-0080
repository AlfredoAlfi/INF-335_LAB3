Out of total assets under management by BIM valued at
around #695 million, #217 million was given to banks and
other outsiders as security for loans to other Maxwell group
companies, Mr. Cooper said. A further #239 million in assets
"would appear {to} have been liquidated and the balance
transferred to other Maxwell group companies," he said. A
final #2 million of assets remain to be traced.
   Robson Rhodes is currently seeking legal advice concerning
the ownership status of assets transferred as security for
loans, officials said. However, doubts have been expressed as
to whether these can be recovered.
   Meanwhile, the liquidated funds "are probably
irrecoverable," Mr. Cooper said. Mr. Maxwell died at sea last
Nov. 5, in circumstances that have never been fully
clarified. In the weeks that followed, his empire collapsed
under the weight of heavy debts, causing big losses for banks
and severe financial hardship for Maxwell pensioners.
