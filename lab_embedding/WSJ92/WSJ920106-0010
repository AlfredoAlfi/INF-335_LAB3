Circon Corp. Says Net
   Soared in 4th Quarter
"The fundamental thing happening here is the accelerating
acceptance of the minimally invasive surgery market," Mr.
Auhll said in an interview. "There is a massive change in how
surgery is being performed. Fortunately, we are in a position
to benefit from this."
   For the fourth quarter, the company expects to report net
of $1.5 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with $500,000,
or eight cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 36% to
$20.1 million from $14.8 million. Average shares outstanding
increased to 7,350,000 from 5,950,000.
   Much of the increase in net stemmed from a 40% boost in
domestic sales of medical instruments and a 38% rise in
international sales. Manufacturing efficiencies were also a
major factor, however. Improved manufacturing technology, new
products that are more profitable, and economies of scale
meant that Circon's gross profit as a percentage of sales
climbed to 52.9% last year from 49.8% in 1990.
