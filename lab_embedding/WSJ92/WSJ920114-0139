Pepper...and Salt
An evening of poker
   And drinks with the boys
   Once ranked quite highly
   Among masculine joys.
   But in our current climate,
   This reeks of sexist regression;
   So husbands now tell their wives
   They're having a male-bonding session.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   Chapter-Eleven Hero?
                                                                                                       

   The merchant overwhelmed by liens
   Can't get out of the woods;
   Some people live beyond their means,
   He lives beyond his goods.
   -- Robert Fitch.
