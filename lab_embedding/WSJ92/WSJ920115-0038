Business Brief -- King World Productions Inc.:
   Fiscal First-Quarter Profit
   Edged Up to $36.6 Million
In New York Stock Exchange trading, King World rose $1.375
to $25.75.
   King World said the expenses came from substantially
higher advertising and promotion spending associated with the
introduction of "Candid Camera," and for the 1991-1992 season
of "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
   The company said revenue rose to a record $204.4 million
from $175 million. The gain resulted primarily from the
introduction of "Candid Camera," and increased cash license
fees from "The Oprah Winfrey Show," as well as "Wheel of
Fortune" and "Jeopardy]" primarily because of a greater
number of shows produced.
