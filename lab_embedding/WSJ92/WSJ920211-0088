International:
   Israeli Minister Attacks
   U.S. on Loan Guarantees
Ehud Gol, spokesman for Prime Minister Shamir, said Mr.
Olmert's comments "do not necessarily reflect the Prime
Minister's opinion. The Prime Minister hopes and believes
Israel will receive the loan guarantees."
   While Israeli officials have always rejected linkage
between humanitarian assistance for the immigrants and the
building of settlements, Mr. Olmert's speech went far beyond
the government's traditional position. He charged that the
ultimate U.S. goal is to force Israel to withdraw from
territories it occupied after the 1967 war, which he called a
"death verdict" for the Jewish state.
