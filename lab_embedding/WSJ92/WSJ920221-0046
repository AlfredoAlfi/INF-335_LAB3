Business Brief -- Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co.:
   Company Offers to Purchase
   Remaining Interest in Unit
A Goodyear spokesman said "the flexibility that this will
provide us in our Canadian operations is well worth the
cost." Goodyear has been working to reduce its debt which is
currently $2.6 billion.
   In a news release, Goodyear Tire said the move was in the
best interest of Goodyear Canada and its shareholders, but
declined to elaborate.
   A special committee of Goodyear Canada directors, who are
independent of Goodyear, has been appointed to consider the
proposal and to report to the board. In a news release,
Pierre Des Marais, the chairman of the committee, said the
committee would retain its own independent financial adviser
to value Goodyear Canada's shares.
