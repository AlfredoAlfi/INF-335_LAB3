   New York Times Net
   Tripled in 4th Quarter
   As Revenue Was Flat
Still, without the various charges, pershare earnings
would have been up sharply, to 41 cents from 24 cents. The
company cited cost-cutting, partly stemming from the
reduction of 160 jobs at the New York Times. The company also
said circulation revenue rose, and newsprint costs dropped.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter was essentially flat, at
$452.5 million compared with the year-earlier $456 million.
Ad linage at the New York Times dropped 8.8% to 22.1 million
lines, but revenue for the whole newspaper group was down
just 1.2%, to $345.7 million.
   For the year, net dropped 28% to $47 million, or 61 cents
a share, from $64.8 million, or 85 cents a share. Revenue
fell 4.2% to $1.7 billion from $1.78 billion.
   The company's stock price rose 25 cents yesterday to close
at $28 a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.
