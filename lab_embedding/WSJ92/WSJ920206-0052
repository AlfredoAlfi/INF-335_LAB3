LTV Loss Narrowed
   In Fourth Quarter
   As Sales Slid 5.9%
For the quarter, LTV's steel operations had a loss of $54
million, wider than the 1990 period's $11.1 million operating
loss. Sales dropped 8.3% to $850 million.
   The company's energy business posted a quarterly operating
loss of $16.3 million, after charges related to excess and
slow-moving inventory. It had operating income of $1.4
million a year earlier. Sales fell 14% to $74 million.
   Aerospace and defense businesses, which are being sold to
raise cash for the company's reorganization, reported
operating income of $14 million, up from $8.8 million a year
earlier. Sales dipped 1.2% to $592 million.
   The Bush administration's plan to limit production of the
company's B-2 Stealth bomber to 20 aircraft will "have a
significant impact" on operating results, LTV said, but said
it still has two years of production left even if the plan is
adopted. The company this week said it had agreed to sell its
aircraft and missiles businesses to a company formed by
Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp.
