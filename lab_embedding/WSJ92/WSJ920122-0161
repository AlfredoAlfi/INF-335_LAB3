   Fujitsu Group's HDTV Chip Set
The new decoder, which unscrambles signals based on
Japan's "Muse" standard, uses 12 integrated circuit devices
compared with the conventional 150.
   With the announcement, the consortium has a headstart
against competing groups. They include NEC Corp. and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan and LSI Logic
Corp. of the U.S., which probably won't be shipping
commercial samples of its HDTV chip set until the spring of
1993, according to a spokeswoman for NEC.
   Toshiba Corp. of Japan and Motorola Inc. of the U.S. are
also working together, and hope to produce samples "sometime
at the end of this year or sometime next year," a Toshiba
spokesman said.
