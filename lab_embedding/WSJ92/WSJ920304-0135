Help-Wanted Ads
   Declined in January
   To A Nine-Year Low
"This continued lack of recovery in the labor market is
one of the major factors in depressed consumer attitudes.
While it is unlikely that the labor market decline will
deepen further, there is very little in the outlook to
suggest a significant improvement in the next few months,"
said Ken Goldstein, the board's economist.
   Advertising volume fell in eight out of the nine measured
regions in the country. The New England region registered the
only increase in volume. "Regionally," stated Mr. Goldstein,
"the one bright spot remains the job market recovery in New
England. The labor market decline there had been more severe
than anywhere else. And yet the region seems to be now well
on the path to recovery -- though the process still has a
long way to go."
   Advertising dropped slightly in the Pacific, West North
Central, East North Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic,
East South Central and West South Central regions. Hardest
hit was the Mountain region.
   The nonprofit research organization's monthly survey
tracks help-wanted ad volume in 51 major U.S. newspapers as a
gauge of change in the supply of jobs.
