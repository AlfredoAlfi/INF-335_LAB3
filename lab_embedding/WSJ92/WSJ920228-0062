North Broken Hill,
   CRA to Reduce Stake
   In Pasminco After Loss
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The extraordinary loss relates to a write-down of the
carrying value of the Elura mine. Pasminco said it will sell
the Elura mine and its European operations if it receives
"satisfactory" terms. It said proceeds from the sales would
be used to reduce debt and finance improvements at other
operations.
