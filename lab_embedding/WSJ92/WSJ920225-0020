Marketing  Media:
   Fired Male Reporter
   Charges KMEX-TV
   With Sex and Age Bias
The suit is unusual because most sex discrimination cases
are brought by women. Mr. Lechuga's lawyer, Gloria Allred,
said this may be the first sex and age discrimination lawsuit
brought by a man in the television news business.
   According to the suit, filed yesterday in state court
here, Mr. Lechuga was the most senior and experienced
reporter in KMEX's news department when he was fired. He
never received any significant criticism of his work, either
orally or in writing, the suit said.
   The suit seeks reinstatement of Mr. Lechuga to his former
job, as well as unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages.
   In a statement, KMEX said that similar complaints by Mr.
Lechuga filed with his union, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations
Board, either weren't pursued or were withdrawn. "KMEX is
confident of a similar outcome in this instance."
   KMEX is part of the Univision Station Group Inc., a unit
of Hallmark Cards Inc. in Kansas City, Mo.
