   `Scrooge Munificient?
   I'll Retire to Bedlam'
Perhaps Mr. Cowans needs a nocturnal visit from the same
spirits that visited Scrooge.

   Mr. Cowans may or may not have been serious in praising
Dickens's most notorious skinflint. Even so, he obviously
equates Ebenezer's dour philosophy with that of Ronald Reagan
-- that is to say, the "trickle-down" theory of reinvestment.
But, I do not recall that Dickens indicated that Scrooge ever
did any significant spending or invested his heavy wealth
anyplace but in his own vaults, at least not until after his
somewhat bizarre reborning. However, while he and Mr. Reagan
seemed to have had a number of traits in common, there was at
least one outstanding difference. Mr. Scrooge displayed his
disdain for his fellow countrymen with a scowl; Mr. Reagan,
ever mindful of television, did it with a smile.
