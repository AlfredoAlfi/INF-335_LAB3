Laidlaw's Profit Slumped in 1st Period;
   Economies of U.S. and Canada Blamed
In the quarter ended Nov. 30, Laidlaw had net income of
$40.6 million, or 16 cents a share, down from $77.5 million,
or 32 cents, a year earlier. The company said it only began
feeling the effects of the recession after last year's first
quarter. Revenue was $521.3 million, little changed from
$516.7 million. The results were in line with analysts'
expectations and the company's own earlier forecast.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Laidlaw's Class
B shares fell 12.5 cents to $10.
   The earnings' one bright spot was the school bus
transportation division, which saw operating profit margins
advance slightly to 17.8% from 17.5% a year earlier. A
spokesman said the division benefited from lower fuel prices
and tighter cost controls.
   But profit margins in solid-waste services dropped to
10.2% from 17.4%, and margins in hazardous-waste operations
fell to 13.4% from 21.3%.
   Also hurting earnings was a decline in Laidlaw's share of
earnings of associated companies to $8.4 million from $24.3
million. This was mainly because of a reduced contribution
from 28%-owned ADT Ltd., a security services and auction
concern registered in Bermuda.
