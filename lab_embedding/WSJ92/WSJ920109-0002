TIE Expects to Post
   4th-Quarter Profit
   After Restructuring
The outlook for 1992 is largely dependent on the economy's
performance; many of TIE's customers are small, white-collar
businesses that have been hard-hit by the recession.
   Comparisons with year-earlier results aren't valid,
because of fresh-start accounting related to TIE's emergence
from bankruptcy and its reorganization and restructuring.
Bearing that in mind, TIE in the 1990 fourth quarter posted a
net loss of $9.8 million, or 28 cents a share, on sales of
$34.5 million.
   Also because of fresh-start accounting, the company won't
report for the full year, but rather for the six months ended
Dec. 31. It appears the company will have a net loss for the
six months, Mr. Carter said. For the third quarter, TIE had a
loss of $341,000, or nine cents a share, on revenue of $27.5
million. Mr. Carter said sales are running at slightly more
than $100 million on an annual basis.
   The company is 75%-owned by Marmon Holdings Inc., a
private company, and its affiliates, which are controlled
primarily by trusts for the benefit of members of the
Pritzker family. As a result of the reorganization, TIE's
shares outstanding were reduced to about four million from
about 35 million.
