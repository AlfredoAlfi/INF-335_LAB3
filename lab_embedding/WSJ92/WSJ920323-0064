Business Brief -- Moulinex S.A.:
   French Firm Says '91 Profit
   Rose 11%, Including Krups
Without the Krups figures, Moulinex, based in Paris, would
have seen its net profit rise 15% to 154 million francs. A
company spokeswoman said that financial charges linked to the
acquisition pushed Krups's results into the red in 1991, but
that before financial charges it was "slightly positive."
   The surge in revenue was largely due to the acquisition of
Krups. Moulinex said that without Krups revenue would have
been 6.68 billion francs, up 12%.
