Pepper...and Salt
I've been taking vitamin pills for years:
   "A" for vision and "B" for digestion,
   "D" for better teeth and bones,
   "C" for fighting infection.
   After all this costly pill-popping,
   I wonder if I still should.
   Many doctors now say, "It won't do any harm --
   But neither will it do much good."

   I never get on an airplane
   Minus some nervous tension,
   And calling an airport a terminal
   Doesn't ease apprehension.
