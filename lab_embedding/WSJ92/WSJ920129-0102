Business Brief -- Alco Standard Corp.:
   Company Reports 68% Drop
   In Fiscal First-Period Net
In the latest quarter, earnings from discontinued
operations contributed $639,000, or one cent a share. A year
ago, discontinued operations contributed $50.6 million, or
$1.13 a share. The year-ago gain came largely on the sale of
Drumstick Co., one of Alco's food-systems businesses, which
were discontinued, to Nestle U.S.A. Earnings from continuing
operations rose 22%, to $21 million from $17.2 million.
   The company said its largest business group, Paper Corp.
of America, is benefiting from steps taken last year to
strengthen its marketing, operational and information systems
programs. Although demand for paper continues to be weak,
that business posted a 6% rise in operating profit and a 3.1%
increase in revenue.
   Alco Standard said operating profit at its office products
business grew 38% on an 11% increase in revenue.
