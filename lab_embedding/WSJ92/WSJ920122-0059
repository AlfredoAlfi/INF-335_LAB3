Marketing  Media:
   Viacom, NBC Stations
   Set Venture to Produce
   All-Night TV Shows
The NBC station group, a unit of General Electric Co.,
will produce the latenight programming, and Viacom will
distribute the shows world-wide. NBC's six stations have
agreed to air the Viscott show, and the Viacom distribution
unit is beginning to hawk the show this week to station
executives at the annual National Association of Television
Programming Executives convention in New Orleans.
   NBC stations already have one choice in overnight
programming: "Nightside," produced by the NBC News Channel, a
service of NBC News and its affiliates.
