Business Brief -- McKesson Corp.:
   Fiscal Third-Quarter Profit
   Eased 4% to $26.2 Million
The drug and food distribution company said results for
the latest quarter, ended Dec. 31, reflect fewer price
increases on prescription drugs and a slowdown in
bottled-water sales. Year-ago profit was $27.3 million, or 60
cents a share. The company noted drug manufacturers have been
unable to increase prices as sharply or as frequently because
of cost-cutting in the health-care industry.
   Revenue in the quarter rose 25% to $2.74 billion from $2.2
billion, mostly because of sales added through a recent
acquisition.
