First Capital Holdings
   Creditors Panel Sues
   Shearson Lehman
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a unit of American Express Co.,
is First Capital's largest shareholder, owning a 28% stake.
   In the complaint, the official creditors committee alleged
that Shearson Lehman, former First Capital Holdings Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert I. Weingarten and other
current and former directors of First Capital breached their
fidiciary duties and pursued "reckless" business practices in
the rapid growth of First Capital and its insurance units and
sales that brought brokerage commissions to Shearson Lehman
but which left the insurance units undercapitalized.
   Noted among other things in the complaint is First Capital
Holdings' $300 million purchase in 1987 of what became First
Capital Insurance Group from E.F. Hutton Group Inc., a unit
of Shearson Lehman Brothers. The suit alleges that First
Capital Holdings paid "far too much" for the insurer, which
was in any case undercapitalized.
   A Shearson spokesman called the complaint "without merit"
and said "it is essentially a rehash of allegations of other
suits in which Shearson has been named."
   First Capital Holdings entered bankruptcy proceedings in
May 1991 following the seizure of its principal insurance
units, First Capital Insurance Co. and Fidelity Bankers
Insurance Co., by state regulators in California and Virginia
respectively.
