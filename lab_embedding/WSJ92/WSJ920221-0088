   Orion Pictures Chief
   Gets Movie-TV Post
   At Paramount Unit
The Paramount post, which is primarily administrative, is
a considerable step down for Mr. Bernstein, though it enables
him to remain employed in the movie industry and move from
one of the weakest companies to one of the strongest. Mr.
Bernstein was never involved in creative issues at Orion, and
at Paramount he will head administrative, financial, legal
and business affairs for the film and television units. He
will report directly to Paramount chairman Brandon Tartikoff.
   Paramount has been without a business affairs director
since the departure last month of Leon Brachman. Reporting to
Mr. Bernstein will be Paramount's music publishing and motion
picture theater operations.
   Mr. Bernstein's successor at Orion is expected to be named
today.
