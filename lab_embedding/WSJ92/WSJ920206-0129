   Matsushita, Seiyu Discuss
   L.L. Bean Stores for Japan
A Matsushita spokeswoman said that it would probably
handle the imports of the products, while Seiyu, a major
Japanese supermarket chain, would be in charge of
distribution. Officials of both companies added that details
of the planned venture hadn't been decided. The Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, Japan's largest economic daily, reported estimated
sales of 500 million yen ($4 million) for the first year,
though neither Japanese company would comment on that figure.
   An agreement would signal an expansion in Japan for L.L.
Bean. It would also mark the first time an outlet store has
sold L.L. Bean goods, outside of a store at the company's
U.S. headquarters. The U.S. company sells a variety of casual
clothes, shoes and furniture through a mail-order catalog.
The planned stores in Japan would sell clothes and equipment
for camping, mountain climbing, fishing and other outdoor
sports, officials for Matsushita and Seiyu said.
