   Latest Week Mixed
On six-month CDs sold by major brokerage firms, the
average yield was unchanged at 4.36%, Banxquote said. But the
yield on three-month broker-sold CDs plummeted to an average
of 3.65% from 4.28%, while the average on five-year CDs rose
to 6.57% from 6.50%.
   Yields on "jumbo" CDs, which generally require deposits of
$90,000 and up, also fell on the short end and rose on longer
maturities, although the diffferences were slight. The
average yield on three-month jumbo CDs at major banks eased
to 3.74% from 3.75%, according to Banxquote's 18bank survey.
On five-year jumbos, the average rose to 6.02% from 5.94%.
