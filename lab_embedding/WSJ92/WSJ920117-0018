Business Brief -- Crown Cork  Seal Co.:
   Company Says Offer to Buy
   Van Dorn Will Stay Open
William J. Avery, Crown's chairman, president and chief
executive, said he was disappointed that William G. Pryor,
president and chief executive of Van Dorn, hadn't taken steps
to discuss with Crown the merits of Crown's formal offer,
which was made Jan. 7. Van Dorn's actions show an
"unwillingness to explore credible means to deliver
attractive value" to its shareholders and employees, he said.
   Mr. Pryor said Van Dorn's board "diligently considered"
the offer but decided to reject it because recent changes
have strengthened Van Dorn's position in the marketplace.
Specifically, Van Dorn closed an unprofitable injection
molding machine plant, reduced inventory by $11 million, and
sharply cut production lead time in its plastics division, he
said. He expects a further boost from the company's new
rimless paint can, to be produced this year.
