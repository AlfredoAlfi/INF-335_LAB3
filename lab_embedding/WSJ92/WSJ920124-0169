U.S. to Test Program
   For Widening Access
   To Veterans Hospitals
The test program will last for three years. If successful,
it could be expanded to more or all of the VA's 172
hospitals. "We must be innovative in seeking better ways to
bring medical services to poor rural areas," said Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan in announcing the
program.
   But the move will probably be opposed by veterans groups,
which have long maintained that the VA doesn't have enough
resources to serve veterans adequately.
