Workers Testing Positive
   For Drugs Declined in '91
Despite the improvement, SmithKline said "it is of great
concern that we found 56,000 people on the job or looking for
jobs positive for cocaine last year. And most of these people
knew in advance they were going to be tested for drugs."
   Further, 2.6% of approximately 400,000 workers and
applicants in federally regulated transportation jobs tested
positive for one or more of five illegal drugs, down from 3%
in 1990. Under a federally mandated program, employees deemed
to be in "safety-sensitive" transportation jobs are tested
for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates and
phencyclidine, known as PCP.
   Marijuana and cocaine continue to be the most commonly
detected drugs, SmithKline said. While all regions showed
declines, the greatest drop was in the West, where positive
tests fell to 7.3% from 12% a year ago.
