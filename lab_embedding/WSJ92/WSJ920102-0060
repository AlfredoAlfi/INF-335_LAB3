New Jersey Insurers'
   Motion for 42% Rise
   In Auto Rate Rejected
In rejecting the motion, the court didn't dismiss the
appeal, although it refused to expedite hearings on it. "We
will continue to pursue the merits of the appeal," Mr.
Collins said.
   Insurers had been complaining that the rates charged in
the state-run pool for high-risk drivers were far too low,
leading to deficits that would eventually be foisted upon
them when the pool dissolves in 1993. Mr. Collins said
insurance industry estimates put the interim pool's deficit
for its first year in operation -- from October 1990 to last
September -- at $400 million.
   The pool is a successor to the Joint Underwriting
Association, the pool for high-risk drivers that had chalked
up a $3.1 billion deficit by the time it was abolished last
year.
