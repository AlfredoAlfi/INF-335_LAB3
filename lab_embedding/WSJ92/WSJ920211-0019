Business Brief:
   Whirlpool Reports Profit of $40 Million
   For Fourth Period on 6% Revenue Gain
Whirlpool said the results "buck the industry trends," in
the face of steady declines in North American demand for home
appliances and a relatively flat European market.
   Whirlpool shares jumped $3 yesterday to close at $43.50 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The company said the quarter's results reflect a "positive
swing" in the performance of its Brazilian operations. The
company's interest in Brazilian affiliates contributed $2.8
million, or four cents a share, compared with a loss of $15
million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Whirlpool's net for 1991 more than doubled to $170
million, or $2.45 a share, from $72 million, or $1.04 a
share. Both years include charges. Sales rose 2% to $6.77
billion from $6.61 billion.
   The company said all of the business units that compose
its North American Appliance Group increased their market
position during the year, and total shipments rose.
   North American shipments rose more than 5% in the quarter,
but declined by more than 5% in the full year. Whirlpool said
its expects North American shipments to rise about 5% in
1992, but the gain isn't "likely to occur before the end of
the second half of the year." Shipments in Europe are
expected to increase by about 1%.
