Who's News:
   Sony Music Entertainment
   Names Matsuo as President
Mr. Matsuo began working with Sony Corp. in 1961. He has
worked for most of his career with units of Sony Music,
formerly known as CBS/Sony Group.
   Analysts said the changes appeared to be routine, although
one speculated that Mr. Ozawa may have been moved out of the
president's post as a result of Sony Music's stock offering
in late November, which flopped. In many Japanese companies,
the chairman's post is largely an honorary one, removed from
daily responsibilities.
   A Sony Music spokesman said that the stock listing had
nothing to do with the changes. The spokesman noted that Mr.
Ozawa had been serving as president for 10 years and said
that no unusual factors were behind the changes.
   At the end of November, Sony Music offered about 18
million shares to investors on the second section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange at 6,800 yen ($53.52) each. No buyers
emerged during the first day of trading, and none showed
interest until the price was cut to 5,500 yen during the
second day.
