International:
   Philippine Sale of 67%
   Of State Airline Draws
   Price of $369 Million
That was $111 million more than a floor price that
government auditors had said was too low, and $52 million
more than a $317 million "hurdle" price set just minutes
before the auction in secret consultations among the three
top officials responsible for selling the airline. The
winning bid was $26 million above the next-highest bid of
$343 million by a group led by PCIBank. A third bid of $264
million by UPB Capital fell below the hurdle price.
   Central Bank Gov. Jose Cuisia Jr., one of the three
officials on the PAL privatization committee, said the
winning bid was high enough to offset PAL debt absorbed by
the government last year. The government took over $520
million in PAL debt in August; it has a cash value on the
secondary market of $270 million at the current rate of 52
cents on the dollar.
   The winning group said it hired Korean Air as technical
adviser. The PCIBank group was advised by American Airlines,
and the UBP Capital group by British Airways' Speedwing
Technologies subsidiary.
