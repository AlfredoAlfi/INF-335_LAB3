Big Board Fines
   Eppler Guerin
   And Bars Broker
Thomas O'Toole, Eppler chairman and chief executive
officer, said the problem was "limited, of course, to a
single broker in a single office. We had no problem before or
after that with any customer delivery of checks. We've
revised our procedures, although we had no problem except
this one."
   He said the firm "immediately reimbursed all customers
except for some family members {of Mr. Royer} where the facts
are in dispute."
   A number of other executives also were disciplined -- most
of them without admitting or denying allegations:
   Clifford V. Tomb Jr., Mercer Island, Wash., was barred for
three years for exceeding trading limits at his firm and
other violations.
   Mark A. Roberts, Loveland, Ohio, was suspended one month
for unsuitable trading in a customer account.
   Robert B. Douglass, Dallas, was suspended for one week for
making discretionary transactions in an account without prior
written authorization.
   George Pollock, New York, a former allied member, was
fined $2,500 for supervisory deficiencies.
   Three people were permanently barred for misappropriation:
Vernon Dean Holley, Richland, Mich.; James W. Riley III,
Riverside, Conn., and John Nelson Stafford, Spokane, Wash.
