Uzbekistan Slashes Prices
   On Goods for Its Students
Officials in other republics -- concerned that public
outrage may erupt into violence -- yesterday announced
measures to head off criticism.
   In Azerbaijan, new prices on bread will be reduced 30%
beginning Feb. 1, Tass news agency reported. And Moldovan
President Mircha Snegur promised to create social protection
funds from the profits of price rises. Mr. Snegur also said
costs on housing, transport and medicines for invalids,
students and pensioners would be reduced.
   Mr. Karimov said student protests over high prices were
"just," and he appealed for calm in the wake of unrest in
Tashkent last Thursday, when thousands of student
demonstrators clashed with police near their dormitories. The
trouble occurred on the same day that Uzbek authorities freed
prices and introduced food coupons.
   Government officials said two people died, but opposition
groups and students have claimed anywhere from seven to 21
lives were lost.
