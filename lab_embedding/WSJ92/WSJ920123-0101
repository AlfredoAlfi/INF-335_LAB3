Nuclear Fuel Processors Merger
The new company will be based in Rokkasho in Aomori
Prefecture in northern Japan, the site of a project to build
Japan's first nuclear fuel recycling center.
   The spokesman said the merger is aimed at streamlining the
fuel processing operations prior to the opening of the
Rokkasho center. Nuclear Fuel Service currently specializes
in recycling of fuels, while Nuclear Fuel Industries does
fuel enrichment.
   The new company will be capitalized at 120 billion yen, he
said.
