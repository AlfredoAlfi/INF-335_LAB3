Business Brief -- Autodesk Inc.:
   Fiscal 4th-Period Net Fell
   Smaller-Than-Expected 28%
Last month, Autodesk told securities analysts that
per-share profit for the quarter would be in the range of 30
to 35 cents, an announcement that caused the stock to slide
18% in a day. The company has attributed its problems largely
to revenue shortfalls in overseas markets.
   In late national over-the-counter trading yesterday,
Autodesk rose $1.50 a share, to $25.
