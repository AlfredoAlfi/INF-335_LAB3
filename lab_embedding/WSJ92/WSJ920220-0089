Law:
   Clarence Thomas Returns
   To Lower Court for a Day
The Supreme Court had issued a brief order Tuesday,
assigning Justice Thomas to the Washington court for a period
of one day -- yesterday. Justice Thomas had said earlier that
he intended to finish the opinions he had left incomplete
when he was nominated last summer.
   Other justices have returned to lower courts to finish
work interrupted by their nomination to the Supreme Court. In
these cases, justices recuse themselves if the disputes later
come before the Supreme Court, a high court staff member
said.
