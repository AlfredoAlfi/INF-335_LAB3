Business Brief -- Idex Corp.:
   Firm Sees Quarter's Profit
   Trailing Year-Ago Results
Donald N. Boyce, chairman and president, said he expects
earnings to fall to between 33 cents and 37 cents a share. A
tax benefit from a tax-loss carry-forward boosted last year's
net income to 49 cents a share, and could add two to three
cents to the latest quarter's net income.
   Mr. Boyce said sales were "relatively flat" with last
year's $57.9 million.
   Idex, which went public in 1989, makes products such as
pumps, lubrication systems and banding and clamping devices
for a variety of industries.
   Idex expects the first half of 1992 to remain flat, but
predicts a gradual recovery later in the year. For now, Mr.
Boyce said, "We're not sinking, but we're not seeing
perceptible growth, either."
