Business Brief -- Westvaco Corp.:
   Paper Concern's Earnings
   Fell 15% in Its 1st Quarter
Despite the industry-wide problems that affected the paper
concern in the past year, President John A. Luke was more
upbeat about 1992 and emphasized the company's focus on
differentiated and innovative paper products.
   "In spite of the national recession and inventory
contractions accentuating the traditional seasonal softness
during this period, our earnings remain considerably more
stable in these depressed conditions than those of our major
North American competitors," he said.
