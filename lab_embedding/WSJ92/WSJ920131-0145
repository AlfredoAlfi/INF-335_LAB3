Solvay  Cie.'s Profit
   Declined 20% in 1991;
   Import Pressure Cited
The company said profit before extraordinary items fell
about 40%. Consolidated sales were close to 1990's 255
billion Belgian francs ($7.72 billion) despite a 3% decline
in sales volume.
   Solvay didn't release figures for the latest results aside
from the percentage changes. The company posted consolidated
profit of 15.9 billion francs for 1990.
   The company said that "1991 was marked by slower growth
and fiercer competition, the latter six months of the year
being particularly disappointing."
   "Economic performance indicators don't . . . forecast 1992
as a better year," Solvay added. Analysts said plastics
prices will continue to be pressured by imports this year,
keeping profit flat.
   Solvay said it would cut capital expenditures 13% to 28
billion francs in 1992 from 32 billion francs last year.
   The company plowed 13 billion francs into research and
development programs in 1991, and said it will maintain
investment at that level in 1992.
