Walt Disney Ends
   Antitrust Litigation
   Against News's Fox
Currently, about half the Fox affiliates air the "Disney
Afternoon," four separate shows including "DuckTales," but
about 35% of them break up the two-hour block.
   The lawsuit had been cited in the past as an example of
Disney's aggressive tactics in competing with other studios,
tactics that had sometimes been criticized as excessively
tough. But executives of both companies were effusive in
their praise for each other. Rich Frank, president of the
Disney's filmed entertainment unit, said, "It is time to put
this conflict behind us, and focus on the myriad of good and
longstanding relationships that have existed between Fox and
Disney, as well as the key officers of the two companies."
   Jamie Kellner, president of Fox Broadcasting, said, "We
are very happy at Disney's statesmanlike decision to end this
litigation. . . . Disney's great expertise and success in
animation gives Fox Children's Network much to aspire to."
