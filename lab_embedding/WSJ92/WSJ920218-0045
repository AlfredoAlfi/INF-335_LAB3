Marketing  Media:
   FCC Partly Reverses Curb
   On Negative Political Ads
Political ads still must contain video identification of
sponsors. The agency specified that visual identification
must air for at least four seconds and that the letters must
be at least 4% of the height of the TV picture. The earlier
decision didn't spell out the size or duration. The
commission also said that advertisers don't have to comply
with the new standards until April 1, allowing them to air
commercials that have already been produced.
   The agency's action drew immediate criticism from People
for the American Way and Media Access Project, which have
been fighting for more than a year for more disclosure of
groups who pay for so-called attack ads. "In their haste to
satisfy the political parties, the commission cut the public
out of the process altogether," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman,
executive director of Media Access Project, a
Washington-based public interest law firm.
