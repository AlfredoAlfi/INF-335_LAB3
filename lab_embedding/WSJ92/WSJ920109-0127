Who's News:
   J.C. Penny Names
   McCarthy President
   Of Catalog Division
A Penney spokesman said that Mr. Birkins's retirement
reflects a company tradition of retiring at age 60 or soon
after, and isn't related to the performance of the catalog
division, which has struggled with declining sales. For the
47 weeks ended Dec. 28, the catalog division had $2.76
billion in sales, down 7.2% from $2.97 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   Penney also said that Leo A. Gispanski, 57, will become
controller on Feb. 1, succeeding Robert O. Amick, 59, who
also is retiring.
   Separately, Penney said Charles S. Sanford Jr., 55,
chairman of Bankers Trust New York Corp., was elected a
director, increasing board membership to 13.
