Two Bush Sons Are Cited
   In Suit Filed Against BCCI
The filing identified Jeb Bush as a "Miami real estate
salesman," although he might be more properly described as a
real estate investor. His company invested in real estate
with a company controlled by a major BCCI borrower.
   Jeb Bush didn't immediately return phone calls and George
W. Bush couldn't be reached. William Lerach, the primary
lawyer in the class-action case, declined to comment.
   Including the president's sons in the court record doesn't
guarantee they will become witnesses, but it could perpetuate
the BCCI-related headaches suffered by the Bush
administration. A former White House aide took a job as a
lawyer for a principal figure in the BCCI scandal, only to
withdraw when a furor arose.
   The suit in this case -- managed by the law firm Milberg
Weiss Bershad Specthrie  Lerach -- seeks damages in behalf
of BCCI depositors from auditors, directors and legal
representatives of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. and
several other BCCI entities.
