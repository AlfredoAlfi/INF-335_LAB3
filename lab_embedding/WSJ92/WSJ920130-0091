Letters to the Editor:
   Story Saw Chauvinism
   Where There Is None
My views in support of the open, multilateral, GATT-based
trading system are well known. Sometimes, they are at
variance with the narrow lobbying interests, both here and
abroad, that seek to distort the outcomes of the trade
negotiations, whether regional or multilateral. It is
important to separate the lobbyists' self-serving complaints,
always dressed up in the cloak of national advantage, from
the true national interest of the U.S. and equally from the
larger interest of designing an efficient and equitable
trading system for all trading nations.
