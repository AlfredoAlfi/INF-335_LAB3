General Motors Recalls
   214,500 Defective Vehicles
A second recall involves 9,500 1992-model Oldsmobile
Cutlass Supremes and Cieras, Buick Regals and Centurys,
Pontiac Grand Prixs and Chevrolet Luminas. The company said
some of those models may have automatic transmissions that
bind, possibly causing the transmission to slip into gear
when the shift lever is in neutral, GM said.
   GM said it believes it caught most of the cars with this
transmission defect before they reached customers.
   GM also said it is recalling 19,000 1989-model Chevrolet
Corsica sedans equipped with optional styled steel wheels. GM
said cracks may develop at the outer edges of the wheel
spokes near the rim, possibly causing the spokes to break,
affecting steering and braking.
   GM said that it has received no reports of deaths or
injuries related to the defects. A GM spokesman said the
company knows of an unspecified number of accidents related
to the truck recall, but hasn't heard of accidents caused by
the transmission or wheel defects.
