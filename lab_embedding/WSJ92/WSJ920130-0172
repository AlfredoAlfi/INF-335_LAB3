Del Webb Texas Purchase
The parcel, located in west Travis County between Highway
71 and the Pedernales River, is currently being used as a
cattle ranch by owner Mike Levi and his sister. Webb, a major
developer of retirement communities, had been searching the
Southwest for a site to complement its existing or planned
communities in Arizona, California and Nevada.
