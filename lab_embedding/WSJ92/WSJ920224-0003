Dixie Brewing Co.
   Wins Court Approval
   For Reorganization
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge T.H. Kingsmill approved the plan
Thursday.
   "The only reason this plan got confirmed was because the
only other choice was Chapter 7 (liquidation)," said Dixie's
attorney, Jan Hayden.
   Peter Reid, editor of Modern Brewery Age, in Norwalk,
Conn., and an analyst of the brewing industry, said Dixie has
a chance to make it because of its foray into super-premium
beers.
   About a year ago, Dixie introduced Blackened Voodoo Lager;
the company plans to bring a second super-premium brand to
the market this year. And the brewery will continue to
produce Dixie, its flagship brand.
   "They're going in the right direction for a brewery their
size," Mr. Reid said.
   The 89-year-old brewery filed for bankruptcy protection in
May 1989, after years of sales eroded by major labels with
hefty marketing clout.
   Dixie stumbled through bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1990,
suffering operating losses in at least seven of 12 months.
But the company reported stronger sales in 1991 and a profit
every month before depreciation.
   "For the first time, we're starting to build the brand
back," said Kendra Bruno, who bought the brewery in 1985.
   Mrs. Bruno, her husband Joe Bruno, and a group of local
investors plan to inject $100,000 in fresh capital into the
company. The Brunos will retain a controlling interest.
