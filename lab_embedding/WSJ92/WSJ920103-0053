Business Brief -- Chiquita Brands International Inc.:
   Judge Blocks Morrell Unit
   On Cutting Retiree Benefits
A Chiquita spokesman couldn't be reached. The union asked
federal Judge Richard Battey for a restraining order after
Morrell asked the judge to approve the cuts or order the
union to agree to the cuts. The matter is set for trial in
April, a union spokesman said.
