Business Brief -- MinVen Gold Corp.:
   Miner Intends to Acquire
   United Coin Mines Interest
The proposed transaction, however, will be "vigorously
opposed" by United Coin's largest unsecured creditor, Wharf
Resources Ltd., which holds about 11% of United's common
stock and is owed about $10 million by United, Wharf said.
   Wharf, a Toronto-based mining company, said it will oppose
the proposed reorganization plan, which in Canada is called a
plan of compromise or arrangement, and will hold United
Coin's directors "personally liable for the damages which
flow from the transactions between MinVen and United Coin."
