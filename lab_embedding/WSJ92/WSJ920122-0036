New Times Square Tower
   Is Placed in Bankruptcy
Citicorp and other creditors had filed foreclosure actions
against the building, which is in default of its mortgage.
The bankruptcy filing blocks those actions.
   The building, at 750 Seventh Ave., was part of the late
1980s surge of new construction on Manhattan's West Side. The
commercial real estate market in New York collapsed shortly
after construction on those buildings began. Last month, Mr.
Solomon placed another of his new Times Square buildings in
bankruptcy protection.
   Mr. Solomon said he expects a reorganization plan to be
agreed on shortly. Citicorp officials could not be reached to
comment.
   In addition to the $187.5 million Citicorp loan, the
property has unsecured debt to European American Bank and the
Commercial Bank of Kuwait.
