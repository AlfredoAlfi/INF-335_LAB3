   Start Independent Network
Christopher Pearman, IDV's regional president for Asia
Pacific, said the moves are part of a larger effort to
develop the company's own distribution system in Asia. He
said the company regards the fast-growing Asian markets,
where its premium brands are increasingly popular among a
younger generation of drinkers, as extremely important.
   Seagram described the IDV move as a "mutual agreement,"
which won't affect existing distribution agreements with IDV
in other parts of the world.
