Who's News:
   Pacific Enterprises
   Appoints Coulombe
   Co-Chairman of Unit
Mr. Coulombe becomes the parent company's third executive
vice president and the first designated to oversee retailing
operations. Pacific Enterprises's largest unit is Southern
California Gas Co., one of the nation's largest utilities.
   The appointment inserts a management layer between Mr.
Yingling and Pacific Enterprises's Chief Executive, Willis B.
Wood, who was elevated to that post in December after James
R. Ukropina resigned unexpectedly.
   "We don't see this as new leadership but augmenting
existing leadership," said Tom Sanger, the Pacific
Enterprises spokesman. Mr. Coulombe will also help Mr. Wood
at the corporate level, Mr. Sanger said. Presumably that
means that the newly named executive will be involved in
trying to sell five of the retail unit's six businesses, put
on the block last month. Negotiations have been held with
prospective buyers of some of the chains, Mr. Sanger said. He
declined to elaborate.
   Pacific Enterprises has said it will keep for now its
618-store Thrifty Drug Store chain, which analysts say
accounted for about two-thirds of the parent's retail sales
and about $120 million in losses last year before taxes and
interest charges.
