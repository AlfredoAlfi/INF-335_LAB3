Massachusetts Puts
   Into Effect Strict Auto
   Emission Standards
Massachusetts adopted the rules despite strong objections
by the auto and oil industries, whose representatives have
asserted that the standards would add up to $1,000 to the
cost of a new car. Massachusetts officials estimate the new
rules will add about $200 to the sticker price of a typical
new car and will enable the state to comply with the federal
Clean Air Act at a lower cost than new standards on
industrial emissions would. Cars and trucks contribute more
than half of the state's smog, they added.
   The rules require auto makers to improve emissions control
systems on vehicles and, by 2003, to certify that at least
10% of the cars and trucks sold in Massachusetts are "zero
emission" vehicles, such as electric cars.
