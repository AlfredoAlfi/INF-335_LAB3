L.L. Bean Establishes
   Joint Venture to Open
   Retail Shop in Japan
The Japanese store will be L.L. Bean's first retail outlet
outside the 90,000 square-foot retail store in Freeport,
Maine, where the company is based.
   Both Japanese companies last month confirmed that they
were talking to L.L. Bean about a possible venture, with
Matsushita importing the products and Seiyu overseeing
distribution. The outdoor goods sold in Japan will initially
be imported from the U.S. but some of the products may
eventually be produced in Japan.
   Separately, the Japanese subsidiary of U.S. toy retailer
Toys `R' Us Inc. said it will open its third retail outlet in
Japan on March 31, in Atsugi. The company, which opened its
first outlet last year, plans to have 11 shops by the end of
next year, officials said.
