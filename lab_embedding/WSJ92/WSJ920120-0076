Business Brief -- Sansui Electric Co.:
   Pretax Loss of $82.8 Million

A company spokesman blamed the grim outlook on a
world-wide slump in audio-visual equipment sales, but added
that Sansui is being helped by Hong Kong's Grande Group,
which owns 31% of Sansui. The stake was transferred to Grande
from bankrupt Polly Peck International PLC of Britain, which
still holds 41% of Sansui.
   Sansui expects to have a pretax loss of 3.5 billion yen in
1992, but a net profit of 500 million yen. Sales are expected
to reach 24 billion yen for the year.
