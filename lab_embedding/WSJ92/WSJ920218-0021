Business Brief -- American Express Co.:
   Restructuring Is Announced
   For Charge-Card Marketing
The marketing changes, to be completed over the next two
months, mirror recent operational changes that will allow
employees to offer consistent service to customers who, for
instance, use both a platinum and a green card, the
spokeswoman said.
   The restructuring announcement wasn't accompanied by any
employee dismissals. American Express's Optima and corporate
cards, and its travelers' checks, aren't affected by the
change.
