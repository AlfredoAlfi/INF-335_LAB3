Business Brief -- TransCapital Financial Corp.:
   Deficit in Fourth Quarter
   Estimated at $100 million
TransCapital, which hired an investment banker to sell
TransOhio or arrange a business combination, said "several"
financial institutions have expressed interest in acquiring
the bank. If a transaction isn't completed within 90 days,
the Office of Thrift Supervision may appoint a conservator or
receiver, TransCapital said.
   The loss will bring to $120 million the loss estimated for
1991. Acting TransOhio Chairman William D. Wooldredge has put
in place a plan to reduce expenses, sell real estate owned,
reduce its wholesale and servicing portfolio, and prevent
further deterioration of commercial loans.
