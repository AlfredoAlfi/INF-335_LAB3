   Salmon nowadays
   (Q.E.D.)
   Never need
   To go to sea:
   They get reared
   In pens and cages
   By fisherfolk earning
   Steady wages.
   They never swim
   Upstream to spawn,
   Nor battle bears
   At dusk or dawn.
   In fact, they have
   No urge to roam:
   These fish stay strictly
   Close to home.

   When our firm asked for my early retirement,
   There followed a raucous debate --
   With some complaining that this measure was harsh,
   And others that it came far too late.
