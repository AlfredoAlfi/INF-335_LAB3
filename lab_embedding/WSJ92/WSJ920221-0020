Business Brief -- PepsiCo Inc.:
   Taco Bell Unit Franchisees
   Form Independent Group
The International Association of Taco Bell Franchisees
said it represents more than 1,000 franchised Taco Bells, or
about 70% of the franchised units. The new group said it is
also concerned about issues including contract renewals,
pricing and sales and transfers of franchises.
   "This is in no way meant to be confrontational," said Ron
Bellamy, a Taco Bell franchisee who is the new group's
president. But the licensing issue, he said, sparked
franchisees to band together to ensure that their concerns
are adequately heard by Taco Bell.
   In Irvine, Calif., Taco Bell said: "Any association of
franchisees that can enhance our communications process will
be making a welcome contribution to our business." Taco Bell
owns about 60% of the chain's 3,500 restaurants, while the
remaining 40% are franchised.
