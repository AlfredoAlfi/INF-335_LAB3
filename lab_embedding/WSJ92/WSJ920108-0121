Pepper...and Salt
The early Romans I applaud
   Because they weren't by fitness awed;
   When orgies left their tummies fatter,
   Thanks to their garb, it didn't matter.
   How smart they were, those ancient conquerors --
   Thick things did not make them go bonkerers]
   Fie on aerobics, sit-ups, yoga --
   What I need is a Roman toga.
   -- Dick Emmons.

   Titled Bridled
                                                                                                       

   These CEOs, CFOs and COOs
   Are leaving me at a loss --
   And longing for the good old days
   When I had one plain old boss.

   A man's best friend is his dog, they say;
   It usually does what's assigned --
   Whereas a cat obeys orders
   Only when it's inclined.
   -- George O. Ludcke.
