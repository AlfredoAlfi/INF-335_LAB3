Business Brief -- MCI Communications Corp.:
   Firm to Offer Agencies
   International Phone Services
While an MCI spokesman estimated that the business could
generate up to $100 million in revenue over five years, the
Defense Commercial Communications Office, which awarded the
contract, said the deal has an "estimated lifetime value of
more than $35 million."
   Agencies could choose to continue service with their
present carrier. DECCO is the acquisition arm of the Defense
Communications Agency and acted as administrator for federal
agencies.
   Services covered by the contract include private network
service, calling card and operator service and billing
features. It also will give agencies more control over their
telecommunications spending, MCI, based in Washington, said.
   MCI had revenue of $8.43 billion in 1991.
