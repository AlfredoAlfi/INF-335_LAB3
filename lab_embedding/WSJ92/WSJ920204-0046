Law:
   Liquidators of Hunt Estate
   Seek Racketeering Charges
Attorneys and spokesmen for various Hunt family members
involved in the case declined to comment on the filing.
   Mr. Harper declined to discuss the allegations or name
potential defendants in the RICO action except to say that
they would be limited to defendants named in the earlier
suit.
   In June, the trustees filed a suit against various Hunt
friends, family members and business associates, alleging
that they received more than $100 million in cash, real
estate and other property from the Hunt estates in the months
prior to Sept. 21, 1988, when the two brothers and their
wives filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Because the Hunt brothers' Chapter 11 cases have been
completed, the trustees are legally unable to assert new
charges against them.
