Oklahoma Voters Approve
   Limits on Increasing Taxes
The National Federation of Independent Business, the major
small-business trade group, actively supported the measure,
along with the Oklahoma Taxpayers Union. Angered by four
major tax increases in less than a decade, they argued that
state taxes must be corraled and also maintained the measure
would aid economic development in the state.
   But opponents, including the Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce
and the Association of General Contractors, spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars to defeat the amendment. They contended
the restrictions would hurt economic development, boost
property taxes, preclude any tax decreases, and lift current
tax exemptions on farmers and ranchers.
   Proponents of the amendment said the new restrictions are
the toughest in the nation. Of the election outcome, "it is a
shot that will be heard around the United States," asserted
Dan Brown of the Oklahoma Taxpayers Union.
