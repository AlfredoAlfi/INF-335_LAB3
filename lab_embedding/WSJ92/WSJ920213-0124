Karfunkle Wins a Prize
   For Economic Forecasting
The economy faces "a rocky road to recovery," Mr.
Karfunkle predicted yesterday. He expects "painfully slow,
uneven and irregular" growth, with less than a 1% increase
this year in gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation.
He also expects the Federal Reserve to cut short-term
interest rates further. Asked what he will do with his $5,000
Theodore H. Silbert Annual Economic Forecasting Award, Mr.
Karfunkle quickly replied: "I plan to save it."
   The prize is sponsored by Sterling National Bank  Trust
Co. of New York, whose chairman is Mr. Silbert. The prize was
presented by former Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, who observed dryly that economists generally "have
not been notable" for accuracy in forecasting.
