Business Brief -- Applied Solar Energy Corp.:
   Holders Clear Concern's Sale
   To Westar for $20 Million
Under the agreement, American Cyanamid Co., which owns 75%
of Applied Solar's stock, would receive $1.99 a share plus
cash and notes in payment of $9 million of loans outstanding,
instead of $3.58 a share as originally reported. Other
shareholders would receive $6 a share in cash.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Applied
Solar shares closed at $5.75, down 12.5 cents.
   A spokesman for Westar Capital, an investment concern
based in Costa Mesa, Calif., said Applied Solar "took
concessions" in the definitive sale price because the company
had no other buyers. Westar said the sale was expected to
conclude within 10 days after regulatory approval.
   A spokesman for American Cyanamid, a biotechnology and
chemical concern, declined to comment.
