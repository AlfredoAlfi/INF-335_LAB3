   Esstar Units, Complete
   Junk-Bonds Swap
Essex said it accepted $86.6 million of Amstar's 11.375%
senior subordinated notes, after holders tendered $90.3
million. It said it then exchanged the notes for $100 million
of its own 14% subordinated debentures held by Amstar, plus
$25 million of its discount notes held by Amstar for the
principal amount of the Amstar debt purchased.
   Officials of Amstar, Essex and Merrill Lynch couldn't be
reached for details on the transaction, including a valuation
to bondholders against the original face amount of their
investment. The Amstar bonds currently are trading at about
75 to 77 cents on the dollar, according to junk bond traders.
The companies in November sought to retire some of their debt
at a discount of about 55 cents on the dollar, but in
December modified the terms to sweeten the exchange value to
about 75 cents on the dollar.
