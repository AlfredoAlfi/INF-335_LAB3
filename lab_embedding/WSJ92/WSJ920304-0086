Banco Ibercorp in Receivership
Bankers in Spain said the central bank's move appeared to
reflect a determination to crack down on mismanaged banks and
other financial entities to try to protect the reputation of
Spain's financial system. Last week, financial holding
company Cor Group S.A. tried to suspend payments but was
declared bankrupt almost immediately by a Madrid court.
