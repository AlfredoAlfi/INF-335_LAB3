Business Brief -- Moog Inc.:
   Defense Cuts Cited as Firm
   Posts Loss of $7.1 Million
In the first quarter, ending Dec. 31, Moog had sales of
$73 million compared with $78.6 million a year earlier. The
decline was largely the result of lower sales in Moog's
recession-hit German and English subsidiaries. Backlog as of
Dec. 31 was $219 million, down from $237 million a year ago.
The company expects backlog will fall to about $200 million.
   Moog President Robert T. Brady said the company will
return to profitability immediately. "With a reasonable
recovery in our overseas industrial business, we expect to
earn back most or all of the first-quarter loss in the
balance of the year," he said.
