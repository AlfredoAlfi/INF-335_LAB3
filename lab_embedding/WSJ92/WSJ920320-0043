Business Brief -- Robert-Mark Inc.:
   Sale of Real Estate Business
   In New York Is Arranged
The New York real estate business included 10 offices and
about 230 sales associates. The business generated about 79%
of Robert-Mark's revenues, which totaled $2.9 million in
1991. Robert-Mark will continue to operate an insurance
agency, an advertising agency, its printing operations and
three real estate offices in Connecticut.
   In exchange for the assets, Robert-Mark will retain its
receivables and a percentage of commission revenue generated
by the business being transferred to Weichert over the next
two years. Robert-Mark also agreed to cease operations at a
number of offices that won't be taken over. Proceeds from the
sale are expected to be initially applied to satisfy the
company's outstanding debts, including a secured loan from
Chemical Banking Corp.
