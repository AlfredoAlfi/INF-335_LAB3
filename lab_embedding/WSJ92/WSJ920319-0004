Court Approves Plan
   For New Hampshire
   Electric Cooperative
Delays in completing the plant prevented the cooperative
from including its Seabrook costs in rates it charged to
customers. The cooperative defaulted on loans from the
federal agency in 1987 and operated under a waiver of loan
provisions until last May, when the agency refused to extend
the waiver; the cooperative was forced to file for
bankruptcy.
   Under the plan of reorganization, the cooperative will
have revised repayment terms for about 85% of debt claimed by
the federal agency. Repayment of remaining debt will be based
on contingencies related to the cooperative's electric load
growth and cash levels, the cooperative said.
   All debt to local and trade unsecured creditors will also
be paid in full, the cooperative said.
   Before the reorganization plan becomes effective, the
cooperative must receive approval from the state public
utilities commission for an average retail rate increase of
about 16% to take effect this spring. Future rate increases
are projected to be less than 5.5% a year, the cooperative
said.
   If the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission approves
the rate increase, an election will be held for all seats on
the cooperative's board of directors, the cooperative said.
