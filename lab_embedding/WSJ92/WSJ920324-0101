   Youth Nonsmoking Ads
   Predated Camel Report
Every ad developed by our agency for the youth-nonsmoking
campaign was critiqued by an outside panel of
child-development experts and educators. In their view, the
ads developed for this campaign properly communicate a
nonsmoking message to a 12-to-15-year-old target audience, as
is intended. Be assured that our agency is proud to be a part
of this effort to communicate what is a straightforward
nonsmoking message to youth.
