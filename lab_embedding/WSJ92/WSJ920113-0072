Who's News:
   Tandycrafts Chooses
   Sandlin for President,
   Chief on Interim Basis
The company also said Jerry L. Roy, 49, will give up his
title of chief operating officer but remain senior vice
president, president of the Tandy Leather Co. subsidiary and
a board member.
   Michael J. Walsh, general counsel, said the moves
reflected a unanimous decision by the board and said they
will simplify the management structure by eliminating the
chief operating officer position. He said Mr. Gregson, as
chairman, isn't expected to be involved in the company's
operations on a day-to-day basis.
   In the first quarter ended Sept. 30, the specialty
retailer and manufacturer had net income of $112,000, or five
cents a share, on revenue of $29.6 million. Mr. Walsh said
that only the company's Cargo furniture outlets have been
hurt by the slow economy, while its Tandy Leather unit,
Joshua Christian bookstores and discount office supply
outlets are performing well. He said he doesn't believe
secondquarter results will be materially different from the
profit of $1 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.
