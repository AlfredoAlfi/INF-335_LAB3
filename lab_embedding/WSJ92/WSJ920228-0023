Business Brief -- ServiceMaster L.P.:
   Jury Rules Against Concern
   In Age-Discrimination Suit
ServiceMaster, a health-care and cleaning services
concern, had claimed that Mr. Morgan isn't covered by the
federal Age Discrimination and Employment Act because he was
an executive. The company also said it retired Mr. Morgan for
performance, customer service and other business reasons --
not age.
   Age-discrimination laws exempt from protection executives
or policy-makers with annual pensions of $44,000 or more. Mr.
Morgan's lawyers asked the jury to consider Mr. Morgan's
claim that ServiceMaster awarded him a life annuity of
$44,000 in a last-ditch effort to restore his executive
exemption.
   Susan Krause, vice president, secretary and legal counsel
for ServiceMaster, said the company is "disappointed the jury
didn't agree with our position and we continue to believe Mr.
Morgan was treated fairly throughout his career at
ServiceMaster." The company intends to appeal the award for
money damages, she said.
