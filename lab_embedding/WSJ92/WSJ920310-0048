Kodak Chairman Pay Rose
   But Total '91 Package Fell
Wilbur J. Prezzano, a group vice president of the health
group, who formerly oversaw the company's international
group, got a 4.3% salary increase to $502,011. But with bonus
cuts, his total compensation dropped 19% to $616,817.
   William F. Fowble, a vice president of consumer imaging,
got an 11.7% salary increase, to $473,196 last year. But
including bonus cuts, his total compensation dropped 15% to
$581,176.
   The only top executive who got an increased compensation
package last year was Leo "Jack" Thomas, who was promoted
last fall to the new post of imaging president from head of
the health group. Mr. Thomas, who now oversees two business
units, consumer and commercial imaging, got a 13.5% salary
increase, to $436,850. With bonuses, his total compensation
package increased 7.8% to $760,115.
   Earnest W. Deavenport Jr., head of the chemicals division,
earned $607,737 last year, including $423,383 in salary.
Kodak isn't required to report Mr. Deavenport's earnings from
1990, because he wasn't an executive that year.
   For 1991, Kodak, a photograph apparatus maker, reported
net income of $17 million on $19.4 billion in sales.
