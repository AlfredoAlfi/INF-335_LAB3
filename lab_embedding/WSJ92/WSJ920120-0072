Who's News:
   First National `Agrees'
   With President, West,
   On His Departure
The posts formerly held by Mr. West, 47 years old, will be
filled by Tom LaHay, who will continue as the bank unit's
president, First National said. Mr. LaHay, 51, will be
assisted by James Tecca, executive vice president and chief
credit officer.
   Nancy D. Celick, chief financial officer, said the
company's board decided the bank needed an executive with
more experience "in credit and asset quality, who will be
able to make the tough decisions" in these difficult economic
times.
   For the year, First National said it had a loss of $10.3
million, or $2.88 a share, compared with net income of $6.5
million, or $1.78 a share, a year ago. Its provision for
potential loan losses for the year was $24 million, compared
with $2.6 million. It said it took the provisions due to the
weakened San Diego economy and the impact that has had on its
loan portfolio.
