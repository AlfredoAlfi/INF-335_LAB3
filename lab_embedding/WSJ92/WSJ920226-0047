Marketing Brief -- CBS Inc.:
   Broadcaster Breaks Even
   On Coverage of Olympics
The 16 nights of prime time coverage were watched by an
average 18.7% of U.S. homes with TV sets, according to final
ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co. That was 3% below the Capital
Cities/ABC Inc. network's average of 19.3% for the 1988
Winter Games in Calgary, but comfortably higher than the 17%
rating in prime time that CBS had guaranteed to advertisers.
