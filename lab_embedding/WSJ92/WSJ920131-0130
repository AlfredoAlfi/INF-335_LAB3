Corrections  Amplifications

   THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT has not rendered any decision
on the subject of restrictive covenants in law-firm
partnership agreements. A Legal Beat column on Jan. 20
incorrectly stated that it had. The decision referred to in
the column was a September opinion from a California
intermediate appellate court, which the state's Supreme Court
in December declined to review. The column also misstated the
maximum amount Robert L. Dickson and his six partners could
end up having to pay their former partners at Haight, Brown 
Bonesteel. The correct amount is about $250,000.
