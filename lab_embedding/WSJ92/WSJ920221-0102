Two Japanese Utilities
   Raise Fiscal '93 Goal
   For Capital Investment
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Chubu Electric Power Co., based in the region to the
northwest of Tokyo, will spend 690 billion yen on capital
spending both this fiscal year and next, up from previous
projections of 654 billion yen and 678 billion yen,
respectively, a spokesman said.
   The investment by the two companies will center on
building power plants and improving electricity-transferring
facilities.
   The Japanese electric power industry has been facing tight
supply conditions, especially during the summer
air-conditioning season. The industry expects electricity
demand to increase 2.7% in fiscal 1993 from a year earlier,
the Tokyo Electric spokesman said.
   The two companies' upward revisions come as many major
manufacturers are cutting their capital-spending plans for
the coming fiscal year, reflecting Japan's slowing economy.
