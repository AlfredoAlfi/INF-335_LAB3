Business Brief -- Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc.:
   Firm Is Likely to Obtain
   Patent From U.S. Agency
While the patent, if issued, would cover various
formulations of amylin, it wouldn't block other companies
from obtaining patents on different compositions of the
hormone, the spokesman said. Several other companies are
engaged in amylin research.
   Amylin has received Food and Drug Administration approval
to begin testing a synthetic amylin preparation in humans.
Amylin believes that amylin research could lead to
development of therapeutic products for diabetes, obesity and
related health problems.
   Amylin shares rose $1.625 to $23 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday on turnover of 432,100
shares.
