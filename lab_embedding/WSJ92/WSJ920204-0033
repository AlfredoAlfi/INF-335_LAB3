Senate Counsel Subpoenas
   Reporters in Hill Inquiry
Peter Fleming, the special counsel, issued subpoenas
ordering the reporters, Timothy Phelps of Newsday and Nina
Totenberg of National Public Radio, to appear before him Feb.
13 and Feb. 25, respectively. The subpoenas also demand that
they turn over documents and other materials that could
reveal information about the reporters' confidential news
sources.
   Lawyers for the reporters said they won't cooperate with
Mr. Fleming's investigation. In a letter sent yesterday to
the two ranking members of the Senate Rules Committee,
Washington attorney Theodore Olson, who represents Mr.
Phelps, sought to block the subpoenas, arguing that they
flout "constitutional guarantees of the First Amendment."
   Floyd Abrams, the attorney for Ms. Totenberg, in an
interview yesterday, called Mr. Fleming's move a "futile and
unconstitutional effort to force Nina to break her word to
her sources."
   It will be up to the Senate Rules Committee to decide what
action, if any, to take if the reporters refuse to cooperate
with Mr. Fleming.
