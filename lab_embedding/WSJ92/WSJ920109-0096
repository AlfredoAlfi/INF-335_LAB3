   Says It Has a 25% Stake
   In Big German Insurer
AGF estimated that it has paid an average of 900 marks
($596) for each Aachener share, bringing its total investment
so far to almost one billion marks.
   Aachener has repeatedly rejected AGF's advances, saying
that they are "undesirable." The German insurer is believed
to be opposed to AGF as a dominant shareholder because the
French state controls 75% of its capital.
   AGF said it wants to collaborate with Aachener in
developing the German company's international operations,
especially in the industrial accident and reinsurance
sectors.
   AGF built up its equity interest in Aachener from 16.6% in
December by acquiring shares on the open market.
