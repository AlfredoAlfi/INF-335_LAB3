Technology Brief -- NEC Corp.:
   Marketing in U.S. to Rise
   Through ICF Severn Inc.
As their first joint project, NEC through ICF Severn has
participated in a bidding for supercomputers by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
   NEC has been trying to sell supercomputers in the U.S.
since 1986, but without success. By joining the U.S. company
with established sales records, it is hoping to have a better
chance, the company said.
   Japanese computer makers are allowed to take part in
bidding for supercomputers by U.S. government agencies under
a 1990 bilateral agreement.
