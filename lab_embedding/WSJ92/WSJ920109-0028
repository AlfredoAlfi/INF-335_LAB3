Pebble Beach Owner Moves
   To Revive Membership Plan
A spokesman said Mr. Isutani intends to pursue the plan
with state authorities, but no timetable has been set. His
move to withdraw the proposal from county authorities will
allow the public to "look at the substance" of the membership
program "in an atmosphere that hopefully will be a little
more positive," said Mark Verbonich, a spokesman for Mr.
Isutani's Pebble Beach Co.
   The agreement with the county caused "procedural
complications," spurring lawsuits and countersuits with the
Coastal Commission, said Joseph Petrillo, an attorney for Mr.
Isutani. Nullifying the agreement may make many of the issues
in the lawsuits moot, he said.
