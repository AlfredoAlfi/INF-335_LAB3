Business Brief -- Amoco Corp.:
   Court Orders Oil Company
   To Pay More for 1978 Spill
The appeals court affirmed a July 1990 damages ruling but
boosted the total judgment by raising the method of
calculating interest on the damages.
   An Amoco spokeswoman said the Chicago-based company had
established a reserve for paying the judgment but wouldn't
elaborate. "We have not commented on this in the past nor
will we today," she said. The spokeswoman added, however, "We
continue to believe this will not have a material impact on
the company."
   Amoco attorneys were studying the decision and hadn't
decided whether they would appeal it, the spokeswoman said.
