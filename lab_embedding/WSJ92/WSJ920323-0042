   Dubai Overrules Judgment
   Against Shearson Lehman
The Bamaodahs accused Shearson of trading the account
without their prior approval and of undertaking transactions
that were contrary to Islamic law.
   Banking officials had said that if Shearson lost the case
it could threaten Dubai's role as a major trading and
financial center for the Persian Gulf.
   The large amount awarded by the lower courts to the Saudi
investors could have set a precedent for other legal actions
against investment banks and brokerage firms in the emirate,
they cautioned.
