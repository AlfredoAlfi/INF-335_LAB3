California Agency,
   Two Utilities Agree
   To Shut Nuclear Plant
That would mean "a slight increase" in those utilities'
rates during the next four years for recovery of remaining
investments of $350 million by Edison and $100 million by San
Diego GE, said Robert Kinosian, project manager for the
commission's division of ratepayer advocates.
   But "over the long term, {the shutdown} would reduce
ratepayer costs," Mr. Kinosian said, largely because the
utilities and their ratepayers are facing costs of about $125
million during the next two years to bring the plant up to
federal regulatory standards.
   The proposed agreement would settle a dispute between the
utilities and the ratepayer division, a quasi-independent arm
of the commission. The division had argued that the planned
improvements were costly and wouldn't guarantee efficient
operations, while the utilities maintained that the unit was
profitable and wanted to keep it running.
   The San Onofre nuclear generating station's unit, with a
capacity of 425,000 kilowatts, is 80%-owned by Edison and 20%
by San Diego GE. The agreement wouldn't affect Units 2 and 3
at the same site. The proposed closure would be the third
nuclear plant shutdown in California, the commission said.
