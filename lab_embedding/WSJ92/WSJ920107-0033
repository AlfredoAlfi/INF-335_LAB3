Eight companies Reach
   Accord on Satellite Group
The consortium plans to launch in 1995 two satellites
covering the U.S. and Europe, Orion Network Systems said.
   The international satellite communications market is
dominated by the International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, or Intelsat, which is owned by international
telecommunications companies.
   A syndicate of banks will lend the consortium $400
million. In addition, a Nissho Iwai spokesman said, the
participants will contribute the following: Orion Satellite
Corp., which is a unit of Orion Network Systems, $30 million;
British Aerospace, $30 million; Matra, General Dynamics,
Orion Network Systems, Nissho Iwai and Stet, $10 million
each; and Kingston Communications and COM DEV, $5 million
each.
   British Aerospace will be the prime contractor for the
satellite system, while Orion Satellite will operate it.
