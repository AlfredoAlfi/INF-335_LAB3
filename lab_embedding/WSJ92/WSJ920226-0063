Business Brief -- Pegasus Gold Inc.:
   Company Agrees to Acquire
   Stake in Australian Concern
The deal is contingent on the approval of Zapopan
shareholders and the Australian government.
   Zapopan said it would use the proceeds from the sale of
shares to pay off its debt and to buy the 50% interest it
doesn't already hold in a joint venture with Billiton
Australia Gold Pty. That venture includes the Tanami gold
mine in the Northern Territory of Australia, currently in
production, and the Mt. Todd mine, which is expected to begin
production in mid-1994.
