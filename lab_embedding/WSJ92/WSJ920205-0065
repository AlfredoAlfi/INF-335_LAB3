WPPSS Settlement
   Over Bond Default
   Is Affirmed by Court
"We affirm the district court's approval of the settlement
agreement and allocation plan in all respects," according to
the appeals court opinion written by Judge Edward Leavy.
   It wasn't clear late yesterday if attorneys for the two
disgruntled bondholder groups would petition the U.S. Supreme
Court to review the decision. Attorneys for the parties
couldn't be reached.
   Barring such an appeal, the ruling clears the way for
distribution of settlement payments to an estimated 25,000
bondholders who purchased their bonds before June 1983.
Settlement funds have been collected from WPPSS, several
utilities, the Bonneville Power Administration, the state of
Washington, and various professional firms.
   The total amount of payments will be reduced by attorneys
fees, set by the Tucson federal judge at $37 million, or
about one-third of the $108 million the attorneys had
requested. Some of the attorneys have appealed the decision.
