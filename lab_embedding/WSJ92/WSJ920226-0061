Business Brief -- Arnold Industries Inc.:
   SilverEagle to Be Acquired
   In Stock-Swap Transaction
Arnold, a trucking and warehousing company, said that
SilverEagle operates primarily as a truckload carrier along
the Atlantic seaboard and in the South, and that it had
operating revenue of more than $30 million in 1991. A
truckload carrier takes a full cargo from one point to
another, without any intervening pickups or drop-offs.
   Arnold and SilverEagle's president, Stephen J. Silverman,
said he has agreed to continue in that role after the
acquisition.
