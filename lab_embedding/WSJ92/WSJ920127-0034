Business Brief -- Solitron Devices Inc.:
   Semiconductor Concern Files
   For Chapter 11 Due to Fire
After a fire in August destroyed all of its inventory and
disabled shipments, the maker of semiconductor parts for
missiles and jets said it was unable to buy parts. The
company estimated damages in the fire at $15 million in its
insurance claim. "The damages spiraled," said Stephen H.
Lewis, the company's attorney.
   If Solitron does complete a reorganization, it will reduce
bank debt to $3 million from about $22.5 million. The company
said it also would discontinue several of its lower-margin
products, upgrade equipment and move to facilities less than
one-fourth the size of its current facilities.
