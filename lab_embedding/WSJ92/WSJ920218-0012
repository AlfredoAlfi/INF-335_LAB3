Economy:
   Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
January data for release this week will show an economy
poised for growth, says Cynthia Latta, financial economist at
DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass.
   The economy has "stoped moving sideways," Ms. Latta says,
noting that retail sales, particularly of cars, are rising
and initial jobless claims are falling. "The recovery is
going to take place, she says.
   Look for housing to bolster the economy's climb from
lethargy. Riding "the momentum of fairly weak prices and low
mortgage rates," housing starts rose 2% last month to a 1.13
million-unit annual rate, Ms. Latta estimates. The 5.4% rise
in January retail sales of building materials supports Ms.
Latta's prediction.
   Favorable inflation data are boosting consumer purchasing
power. The Consumer Price Index likely rose 0.2% in January,
the DRI/McGraw-Hill economist says. The so-called CPI "core
rate" which excludes food and energy prices, probably rose
0.3%, she says.
   December trade data is also due this week. Ms. Latta
forecasts a $4 billion trade gap for the month, with rising
inventories holding down imports.
