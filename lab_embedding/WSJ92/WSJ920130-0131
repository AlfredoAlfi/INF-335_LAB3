Business Brief:
   Asarco Cuts Payout
   In Half; Quarterly Net
   Rises to $12.2 Million
Sales for the quarter dropped 10.5% to $492.4 million,
from $549.9 million. Asarco said that copper prices are still
"satisfactory," but lead, zinc and silver prices remain weak.
   The company said it cut its dividend because it believes
the payout should relate to the company's results. The
40-cents-ashare dividend has exceeded the company's earnings
since the fourth quarter of 1990, Asarco said. The reduced
dividend will be paid March 2 to holders of record Feb. 13.
The company has about 41.2 million shares outstanding.
   The stock market reacted negatively to the news. In late
trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Asarco
shares were quoted at $21.25, down $2.625.
   For the year, the company had net income of $46 million,
or $1.12 a share, down 69% from $149.1 million, or $3.60 a
share, in 1990. Sales dropped 13.5% to $1.91 billion from
$2.21 billion the previous year.
