Altus Will Be Reimbursed
   For Executive Life Expenses
The items for which Altus, a unit of France's Credit
Lyonnais S.A., will be reimbursed include such items as legal
fees and travel expenses. Among the amounts to be paid are
$1,350,000 for public relations consultants, $350,000 for
Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. unit for investment
banking services and $1,270,000 for a consulting firm,
Milliman  Robertson Inc. In addition, Altus will be repaid
$250,000 for its travel expenses.
   Prior to the ruling approving the reimbursements, holders
of municipal guaranteed investment contracts from Executive
Life objected to the payments, claiming they were "excessive
and unreasonable."
   A spokesman for the California Insurance Department said,
"All the bidders for Executive Life were told they would be
reimbursed for expenses if their offer was chosen."
