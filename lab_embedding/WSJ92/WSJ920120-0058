Business Brief -- CH Rauch Inc.:
   Jewelry Store Chain Files
   For Chapter 11 Protection
Thirty-two of the company's stores are in Kentucky, with
the others in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia,
Virginia and North Carolina.
   Mr. Cohen said the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing Friday
became necessary after lackluster 1991 sales, including a
disappointing Christmas season.
   The jewelry chain is the second in two months to announce
closings following dismal holiday sales. Zale Corp. said in
late December that it was shutting 400 of its 2,000 stores.
