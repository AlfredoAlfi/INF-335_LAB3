Business Brief -- International Rectifier Corp.:
   License Pact With Harris
   Will Settle Patent Dispute
International Rectifier said its management thinks "the
balance of payments will favor the company."
   A spokeswoman for Harris, which is based in Melbourne,
Fla., said it is too soon to calculate the impact because
there are "a number of variables going forward." For example,
Harris is developing a new product that may supplant some of
the products on which the company has agreed to pay
royalties, she said.
   The agreement, which settles litigation in federal court
in Los Angeles, also lifts an injunction imposed in June that
barred Harris from making, selling and shipping certain
products. The injunction didn't have a material impact on the
giant electronics concern, the spokeswoman said.
