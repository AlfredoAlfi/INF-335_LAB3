Business Brief -- Dynamics Research Inc.:
   Defense Contractor Says
   4th-Quarter Profit Rose
Dynamics Research got 89% of its revenue last year from
defense contracts, mostly providing computer services under
five different contracts.
   Mr. Rand said net for the year rose 10% from $3.3 million
a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to 72 cents or 73
cents a share from a restated 62 cents a share, he said.
Revenue rose about 7% to a record $97 million.
   In November the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit
charging that Dynamics withheld price information during
negotiations on a contract for maintaining logistics and
testing software on the Air Force's F-16 aircraft. Mr. Rand
said he is "pretty optimistic that it won't have any
significant impact."
