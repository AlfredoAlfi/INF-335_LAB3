Business Brief -- Data Translation Inc.:
   Firm Wins Verdict in Suit
   Over Federal Contract Talks
In the suit, the government asked that Data Translation be
liable for treble damages of $1,318,242, and penalties of as
much as $10,000 for each of at least 214 invoices submitted
by the company. The government charged that contracts
obtained by the company, a maker of computer products based
in Marlboro, Mass., were inflated by $439,414.
   "The company contended throughout that it had disclosed
all required information," said Ellen Harpin, a spokeswoman
for Data Translation. The U.S. attorney's office, which has
60 days to appeal Monday's verdict, had no comment.
