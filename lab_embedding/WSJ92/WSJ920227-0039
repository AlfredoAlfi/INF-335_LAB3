Business Brief -- Joseph Horne Co.:
   Department Store Operator
   Reaches Lawsuit Settlement
The agreement also includes transferring charge accounts
from Horne's Ohio stores to the new owner, a Cleveland
department store chain named Higbee's, owned by Dillard and
DeBartolo. Under the settlement, Dillard and DeBartolo will
offer jobs to Horne employees at those stores.
   In 1988, Horne sued Dillard, a department store chain
based in Little Rock, Ark., and DeBartolo, a Youngstown,
Ohio, retail developer, charging they breached their contract
when they failed to acquire the Pittsburgh department store
chain.
