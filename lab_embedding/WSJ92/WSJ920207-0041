Business Brief -- International Telecharge Inc.:
   Accord Is Made to Settle
   Two Class-Action Lawsuits
The Dallas provider of long-distance services said that
shareholders filed the suits in 1989 on behalf of people who
purchased the company's stock between May 5, 1988, and Aug.
11, 1989. The lawsuits alleged that the company violated
securities laws by omitting information and misrepresenting
its financial situation.
   International Telecharge said the agreement includes the
company, officers and directors named in the suits, and its
auditor, Ernst  Young. The company didn't disclose Ernst 
Young's settlement agreement, but a lawyer for the accounting
firm said the firm's contribution "is very, very, very
insignificant."
   The settlement agreement, which is being drafted, is
subject to approval by a Dallas federal court.
