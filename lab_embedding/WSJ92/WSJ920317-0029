International Brief -- Playmates International Holdings:
   Profit Declined 24% in 1991
   On a 26% Decrease in Sales
The company proposed a final dividend of 25 Hong Kong
cents and a special payout of 40 cents, pushing the full-year
payment to 83 cents, up 27% from 65.5 cents in 1990.
   Playmates attributed the earnings decline to diminished
sales due to weak consumer confidence and tighter credit
policies it adopted toward many customers.
   However, the company said that this year's outlook is
"excellent," based on the continued strength of its Ninja
Turtles line and strong expectations for lines based on such
themes as the Star Trek television show and the Addams Family
movie, as well as a beach doll that tans.
   Playmates also indicated that it is seeking acquisitions,
and analysts say the company has more than HK$2 billion
earmarked for that purpose.
