Former Accountant
   Of BNL Branch Barred
   From Banking Industry
The Fed's action against Mr. Post is the first dealing
with former BNL employees. Other orders are expected to
emerge from the agency's continuing investigation. In a
settlement, Mr. Post agreed to an order barring him from the
U.S. banking industry, although he can apply for
reinstatement later.
   A Fed official said that Mr. Post helped BNL's Atlanta
branch keep two sets of books in order to hide unauthorized
transactions from bank regulators.
