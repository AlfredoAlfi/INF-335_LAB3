Who's News:
   Clark Clifford to Leave
   Knight-Ridder's Board
Mr. Clifford, a former presidential adviser and lobbyist,
has been a director of Knight-Ridder since it was formed
through a 1974 merger. He helped win federal approval for a
bitterly contested joint operating agreement between
Knight-Ridder's Detroit Free Press and Gannett Co.'s Detroit
News in 1989.
   Mr. Clifford had resigned as chairman of First American
Bankshares Inc. last year, saying he didn't realize the
Washington bank was controlled by the Bank of Credit 
Commerce International. But a Knight-Ridder spokesman said
Mr. Clifford's departure from Knight-Ridder's board wasn't
related to the BCCI affair. "I think (his) age speaks for
itself," the spokesman said.
