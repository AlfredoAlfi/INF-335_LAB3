   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Mr. Cooklin will be paid #773,000 ($1.4 million) as
compensation for loss of office. He also will receive, over
the next two years, bonuses deferred from past years, the
company said.
   Mr. Cooklin joined Burton in 1970. When he became group
chief executive in November 1990, the company was struggling
through "the toughest trading environment in the company's
history," said Sir John Hoskyns, Burton Group chairman. Mr.
Hoerner, who came to Debenhams in 1987 from May Department
Stores Co., St. Louis, "brings to his new role fresh thinking
about the company's future development," Sir John said.
   Burton posted a fiscal 1991 pretax loss of #3.4 million,
including restructuring charges of #24.6 million. A year
earlier, the company had a pretax profit of #133.1 million.
Sales in the year ended last Aug. 31 slipped 7.1% to #1.66
billion from the prior year's #1.79 billion pounds.
