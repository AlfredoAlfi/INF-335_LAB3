Notable & Quotable
English persons . . . of humanitarian and reformist
disposition constantly went out to the Balkan peninsula to
see who was in fact ill-treating whom, and, being by the very
nature of their perfectionist faith unable to accept the
horrid hypothesis that everybody was ill-treating everybody
else, all came back with a pet Balkan people established in
their hearts as suffering and innocent, eternally the
massacree and never the massacrer.
