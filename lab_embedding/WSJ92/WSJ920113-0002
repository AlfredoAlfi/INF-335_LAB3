Business Brief:
   Sudbury Posts Loss, Files for Protection
   Under Chapter 11; Chairman Resigns
Sudbury said it will pay subordinated creditors $10
million in new five-year subordinated notes when it emerges
from bankruptcy-law protection and give them a majority stake
in the new company's stock. Current common and preferred
stock holders would receive no more than 5% of the new
company's stock.
   Sudbury's bank group, which includes Bank One, Columbus,
Society National Bank, Harris Trust  Savings Bank and
Pittsburgh National Bank, will provide funding of as much as
$6 million for ongoing operations. Sudbury's subsidiaries are
not included in the filing.
   Mr. Veale will be succeeded as chairman by Russel B.
Every, Sudbury's president and chief executive officer.
Succeeding Mr. Every is Jacques R. Sardas, who resigned as
executive vice president of Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co. in
April 1991.
   For the quarter ended Nov. 30, Sudbury had a loss of $5.1
million, or 40 cents a share, compared with a loss of $3.5
million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell to
$87.2 million from $99.0 million.
