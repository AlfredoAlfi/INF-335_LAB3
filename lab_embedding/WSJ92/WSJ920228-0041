   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Vehicle exports to the U.S. came to 162,498 units, a 15%
decline from 191,653. A spokesman pointed to the stalled U.S.
economy and the shift of Japanese car production to the U.S.
Vehicle exports to North America, including the U.S.,
amounted to 190,596 units, a decline of 11% from 215,284.
   January exports showed an 8.3% rise from 503,846 units in
the previous month and were made up of 442,566 passenger
cars, 98,760 trucks and 4,367 buses.
   In value terms, exports of Japanese vehicles and related
parts totaled $6.94 billion. Vehicle shipments accounted for
$5.71 billion and car parts for $1.24 billion.
   Exports to Asia fell 13% to 39,950 units from 45,744, in
part reflecting tax changes in Thailand, Malaysia and
Indonesia that led consumers to take a wait-and-see stance.

units from 151,029. January marked the first annual gain
there since last May.
   Economic liberalization in South America helped push up
