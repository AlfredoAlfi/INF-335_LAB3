Economy:
   Economists Oppose
   `Stimulative' Package
   For `92, Survey Finds
Of those surveyed, 58% oppose a stimulative fiscal
package. Thirty-seven percent called current fiscal policy
"about right," while 36% said it is "too stimulative."
   Current monetary policy netted better reviews, with 61% of
those surveyed calling it "about right," although 32% said it
is "too restrictive."
   The group tagged current negotiations at the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade "a poor bet," with more than
half the respondents predicting the talks will drag on at
least six more months.
   The forecasters predicted that the economy, adjusted for
inflation, will grow at a 0.5% annual rate in the current
quarter, a steep drop from the 2.5% they projected in August.
