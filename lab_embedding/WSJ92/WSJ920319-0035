Business Brief -- Cerus S.A.:
   French Holding Firm Says
   Net Loss Narrowed in '91
These negative factors included a 400 million franc net
loss at Cerus's French bank, Dumenil Leble, and a 470 million
franc write-down to bring the book value of its Spanish
holding company, Cofir, in line with its depressed market
capitalization.
   Cerus has been shedding assets over the past year in a
move to trim debt. Its most recent sales included its
minority stakes in publishing house Groupe Expansion and in
fashion house Yves Saint Laurent, and part of its holding in
Cie. de Suez.
   Cerus said its debt load at the end of 1991 was 800
million francs, compared with 4.1 billion francs a year
earlier.
