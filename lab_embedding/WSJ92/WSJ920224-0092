Levi Will Offer Benefits
   To Unmarried Partners
"We want a nondiscriminatory workplace," said Reese Smith,
Levi's director of employee benefits. "And when we looked at
our policies prohibiting discrimination for race, sex,
origin, or marital status, we realized our own practices were
not in compliance with our policy."
   The decision makes Levi's the largest company in the U.S.
to extend benefits to partners of unmarried employees. It
applies to all of its 23,000 U.S. workers, but is expected to
be used primarily by homosexual couples.
   More and more lawmakers around the country are rewriting
ordinances to accommodate unmarried couples. San Francisco,
Berkeley, Santa Cruz and Seattle allow municipal workers to
add unmarried lovers to health plans.
   But business has actually led the way on the issue. The
Village Voice, the American Psychological Association and Ben
 Jerry's adopted similar policies in the mid-80s.
   The Montefiore Medical Center in New York City and the
computer software giant Lotus Development Corp. outside
Boston granted health benefits to unmarried lovers last year.
