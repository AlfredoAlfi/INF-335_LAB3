Business Brief -- General Signal Corp.:
   Net of $8.8 Million Reflects
   Firm's Cost-Cutting Moves
In the latest quarter, the company had an after-tax charge
of $9.8 million, or 51 cents a share, related to disposal of
its rail-related businesses. In 1990, that charge totaled $5
million, or 26 cents a share.
   Sales fell slightly, to $414 million from $416.3 million.
   Although a robust recovery isn't yet in sight, General
Signal is "positioned to do well even if market conditions
fail to improve," said Edmund Carpenter, chairman and chief
executive officer. General Signal makes equipment and
instruments for the process control, electrical and other
industries. "With a little help from the economy, 1992 could
prove to be a very rewarding year" he added.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, General
Signal fell 25 cents to $54.75.
