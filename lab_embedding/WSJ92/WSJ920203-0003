Ontario Hydro Files
   Claim to Clarify Pact
   With Denison Mines
The dispute could be critical for financially troubled
Denison, which has been selling off many of its assets to
reduce debt. The company, which had a loss of C$19.7 million
in last year's third quarter, has said that its immediate
objective is "to survive as a going concern."
   Ontario Hydro said it filed a claim in the Ontario Court
of Justice seeking to clarify the terms of the supply
agreement, which guarantees Denison a price above its cost of
production. Ontario Hydro said it has paid Denison about C$60
per pound of uranium in recent years. Over a 10-year period,
this has meant paying some C$1 billion more than if the
utility had bought uranium at market prices, it said.
   Ontario Hydro, which is owned by the province, maintains
that Denison's undepreciated assets represent a cost of
closing the mine, which shouldn't be included in the uranium
price.
   "We think Denison has totally misinterpreted the contract.
They want to write off everything and call that a cost of
production," said Ted Bazeley, Ontario Hydro's manager of
nuclear fuel supply.
   Denison is a mining concern based in Toronto. Denison
officials wouldn't comment on the court action.
