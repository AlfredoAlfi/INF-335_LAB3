Japan's December Steel Exports
For all of 1991, Japan's overall exports swelled 5.9% from
1990 to 18.03 million metric tons, the federation said.
   In December, Japanese exports of steel to the U.S. totaled
254,223 metric tons, a decline of 23% from the same month a
year before. Exports to the former Soviet Union fell 47% from
December 1990 to 28,155 metric tons. Recession in the U.S.
and political upheaval in the Soviet Union damped demand in
those markets.
