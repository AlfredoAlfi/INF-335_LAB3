Who's News:
   Furr's/Bishop's Taps
   Prather as President
   And Chief Executive
A spokesman for the cafeteria operator said that Mr.
Levenson, a banker who has run Furr's/Bishop's since a 1986
leveraged buy-out, recruited Mr. Prather because of his
restaurant experience. Mr. Prather formerly was president and
chief executive officer of Hardees Food Systems Inc., which
runs a chain of more than 4,000 fastfood hamburger
restaurants.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 28, Furr's/Bishop's
reported a loss of $9.7 million, or $1.36 a share, reversing
a year-earlier gain of $2.1 million, or 31 cents a share.
Revenue fell to $201.9 million from $216.4 million.
   In December, the company defaulted on $60 million of
senior notes, and began negotiating with lenders for a
restructuring of debt. Those talks are continuing, the
spokesman said.
