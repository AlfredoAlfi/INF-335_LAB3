International:
   Swedish Consumer Prices
The agency said the consumer price index was measured at
230.2 in January, down from 230.8 in December but up from
218.9 a year earlier.
   The decrease was attributed chiefly to the lowering of the
Swedish value-added tax to 18% from 25% on food,
transportation, hotels and restaurants at the start of the
year. The agency said prices for clothes and shoes also
contributed to the decline.
