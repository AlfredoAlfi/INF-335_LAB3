International:
   Loan for Algeria
The loan originally was intended to be $1.5 billion. But a
Credit Lyonnais spokesman said exchange-rate fluctuations
have modified the loan calculations since negotiations began
last fall.
   The Credit Lyonnais spokesman said the official signing of
the accord will take place March 4, and Algeria will have
access to funds shortly after that date.
