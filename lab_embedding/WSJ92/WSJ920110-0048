Business Brief -- Mobil Corp.:
   Criminal Misconduct Charges
   Filed Over Crude Oil Spill
A Mobil spokesman said late last night that he wasn't
aware of the charges and couldn't comment.
   The spill occurred last Jan. 31 when a section of pipeline
failed about 35 miles north of Los Angeles. The same pipeline
has failed more than 16 times over the past decade, said
Erica K. Martin, the deputy district attorney who is
prosecuting the case.
