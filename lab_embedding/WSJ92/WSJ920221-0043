International:
   Recession Is Britain's
   Longest Since World War II
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Most economists expect the current recession to last at
least one more quarter, with the first signs of real recovery
emerging in the second quarter of 1992 at the earliest.
   The preliminary estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of
1991 was down 0.3% from the third quarter and 1.7% from a
year earlier. This compared with a 0.2% rise in the third
quarter, which was boosted by a sharp upturn in oil
production following a maintenance program on North Sea oil
rigs.
   Excluding oil and gas production, the economy shrank 0.4%
in the fourth quarter after shrinking by a similar amount in
the third quarter. According to the figures published by the
Central Statistical Office the economy has shrunk each
quarter since the third quarter of 1990.
   The data puts GDP in 1991 as a whole down 2.4% after a
0.9% rise in 1990. Excluding oil and gas, it fell 2.7% in
1991 after rising 1.0% in 1990.
