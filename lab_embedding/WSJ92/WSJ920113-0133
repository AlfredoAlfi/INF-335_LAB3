France's Hachette
   Denounces Rumors
   That Group Is for Sale
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Hachette used strong words to denounce "false information"
spread by those who said they received it from informed
sources. "They are, rather, spiteful rumors that come from
those who want to dramatize the state of the leading French
communications group in the illusory hope of sharing the
spoils."
   Hachette said it doesn't regret having tried to make a
success out of La Cinq, describing it as a "mission of
strategic importance, even if it was impossible under current
conditions."
   Hachette is 51% owned by Societe Marlis, which in turn is
42% held by MMB, a holding company of Hachette Chairman
Jean-Luc Lagardere.
