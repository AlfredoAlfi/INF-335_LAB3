   Job-Seekers in France Rise
The Ministry noted that January is traditionally a peak
period for entries to the list of unemployment benefit
recipients.
   The Ministry observed that the recent job-seeker advance
was most evident among adult males and workers of both sexes
younger than 25 years old.
   Economists said the January figure was actually positive,
as it confirmed a slowing in the growth of job-seekers. "I
think unemployment is likely to peak in the next few months,
and then we'll see an improvement begin," one economist said.
