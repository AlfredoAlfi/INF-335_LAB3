Business Brief -- Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd.:
   Utility Says Profit for 1991
   Rose 21% to $301.8 Million
Group Chairman Simon Murray predicted steady growth in
sales this year, with new profit coming on stream from an
associated property company. He said the group expects this
year's earnings and dividend to at least match those of 1991.
But he said the group's capital expenditure program, which
calls for spending HK$15 billion between 1990 and 1994, and
the need for its associate to buy more property, have caused
it to restrain its dividend policy.
