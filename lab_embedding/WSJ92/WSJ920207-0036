International Brief -- L.M. Ericsson Telephone Co.:
   Telecom Unit Plans to Cut
   Work Force by 1,000 in '92
"The current recession has adversely affected the markets
of Ericsson Telecom and, as previously announced, order
bookings have declined," the group said. It said the job
cuts, "together with previously completed internal
adjustments," will improve Ericsson's competitive position.
   Ericsson Telecom has 14,000 employees in Sweden, 7,000 of
whom are in Stockholm, the spokesman said.
   The spokesman said Ericsson hoped that the 200 job cuts
outside Stockholm, and some of the 800 cuts in the Stockholm
area, would be due to natural attrition.
