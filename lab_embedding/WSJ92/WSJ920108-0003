Two Exchanges Seek
   Options Trading Tied
   To Biotech Indexes
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The exchanges are seeking to trade index options on
biotech stocks because of strong investor interest in
companies engaged in medical and scientific research. Stock
prices of many of these companies surged last year, though
most of the concerns aren't yet posting strong earnings.
   "There's been a tremendous amount of interest in
biotechnology stocks," said Richard DuFour, the CBOE's
executive vice president for business development. "Biotech
is an industry that's emerging in importance. People are
investing in the stocks hoping they're going to hit the next
big successes early."
   Each of the two exchanges must receive approval from the
Securities and Exchange Commission before it can begin
trading the options.
   A spokeswoman for the Amex, which developed its biotech
index last June and began tracking it from Oct. 18, when it
set a base level of 200, noted that the index stood at 234.72
Monday. The CBOE set its own index at 100 as of Jan. 1, 1991,
and said it now stands at 207.48.
   Amex Chairman James R. Jones said the exchange's index
options would offer investors "an attractive vehicle for
participation in this dynamic industry."
