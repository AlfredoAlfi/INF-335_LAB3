Business Brief -- Martin Marietta Corp.:
   Company Is Chosen by U.S.
   To Manage Plant in Florida
Beginning June 1, the plant will be managed by Martin
Marietta Specialty Components Inc., a newly created
subsidiary. Charles Hall, formerly vice president of another
Martin Marietta subsidiary, was named president and general
manager of the new unit.
   Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., said it will soon
settle with the government on an award fee, based on a
percentage of the plant's $150 million annual operating
budget. Martin Marietta also manages Energy Department
facilities at Oak Ridge, Tenn., Paducah, Ky., and Portsmouth,
Ohio.
   A spokesman for Allied-Signal, Morristown, N.J., said,
"we're obviously disappointed" by the Energy Department's
decision.
