Siemens Profit Grew
   6% in Fiscal 1st Period
   As Sales Also Rose 6%
Profit in the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose to 398 million
marks ($244.2 million) from 377 million a year earlier on a
sales gain of 6% to 16.2 billion marks. New orders, however,
fell 1% in the fiscal first quarter to 20.1 billion marks
overall from 20.4 billion marks in the like year-earlier
period.
   Heinrich von Pierer, deputy chairman, said bluntly that
Siemens "can't expect a repeat of last year, when vigorous
demand for infrastructure investments in eastern Germany and
other regions more than compensated for weaker demand in some
sectors."
   Siemens also disclosed that per-share earnings were 43
marks in fiscal 1991, which ended Sept. 30, vs. 42.30 marks
the year before, adjusted for acquisitions.
   Siemens didn't give a specific full-year forecast but said
it expected the relationship between revenue and profit to
remain stable. Based on last year's return on sales of 2.5%,
this year's net profit likely will top two billion marks, up
from 1.79 billion marks in fiscal 1991.
   In the first quarter, domestic new orders rose 4% to 9.1
billion marks while foreign orders fell 5% to 11 billion
marks, reflecting a continued weakness in recession-plagued
overseas markets.
