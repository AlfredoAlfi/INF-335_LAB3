Technology Brief -- Intel Corp.:
   Chip Maker and VLSI Talk
   About Sharing Technology
Sharing technologies would make sense for Intel and VLSI,
whose strengths are very different. Intel is the world's
biggest supplier of microprocessors, the chips that become
the brains of computers. VLSI's specialty is in chips called
application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which can
be tailored for specific functions.
   Intel has attempted to enter the ASIC market in the past,
never with very successful results. Among VLSI's products are
sets of chips that personal-computer makers use inside their
machines alongside Intel's microprocessors. The companies
have a previous agreement under which Intel buys such chip
sets from VLSI and resells them to its own customers.
