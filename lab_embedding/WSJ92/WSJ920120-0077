Business Brief -- Continental Mortgage  Equity:
   Rights Will Be Redeemed
   In Phillips, Friedman Trusts
The rights allowed shareholders to buy stock at a discount
if a group acquired at least 27.5% of their stock. The
companies said their boards decided that the measures,
intended to deter hostile takeovers, weren't necessary any
longer.
   In addition, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Friedman and companies
they control have accumulated significant stakes in the three
trusts, making a takeover bid unlikely. A spokeswoman said
federal filings by the men indicate that they will continue
to acquire shares in the trusts.
   Currently, the men and related companies own 25.9% of
Continental Mortgage, 27.7% of National Income and 10.6% of
Income Opportunity. The spokeswoman said their ownership of
National Income didn't trigger the poison pill because they
exceeded a 27.5% stake only because the company repurchased
some of its shares.
