Business Brief -- UJB Financial Corp.:
   Dissident Group Is Rebuffed
   On Proposal of Sale, Merger
In a letter to shareholders sent with the company's proxy
statement, the parent of United Jersey Bank said it was not
the opportune time to seek a merger partner or buyer, citing
improved earnings in 1991. UJB previously reported net income
for 1991 of $22.4 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with
a 1990 loss of $5.6 million, or 17 cents a share. The bank's
board has unanimously opposed the election of the new board
members. UJB has about $13 billion in assets.
