Letters to the Editor:
   Effects of Radiation
   Not Fully Understood
In our haste for a cure, we place premature faith in
technology. The effects of radiation are not completely
understood; until they are, it is crucial for women to
reflect and assess judiciously before submitting our bodies
to radiation, and to ask, preferable treatment for whom.
