Who's News:
   Pan Am Corp. Rehires
   McHugh to Oversee
   Liquidation of Firm
After operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-law
protection throughout last year, Pan Am ceased operations in
December and began liquidation procedures. Pan Am is now
considering filing suit against Delta Air Lines for backing
out of a plan to finance Pan Am. The airline's unsecured
creditors asked the bankruptcy court to replace Mr. Ray,
people familiar with the company said, because he was
selected by Delta officials and therefore would not
aggressively pursue suing the Atlanta-based airline.
   For his 3 1/2 months of service at Pan Am, Mr. Ray is
slated to receive $700,000 -- two years' base salary -- in
severance pay. Mr. Ray was unavailable for comment.
   Mr. McHugh, 44, first joined Pan Am in 1988 after 20 years
at Trans World Airlines. He was given a $600,000 severance
package in September and has been unemployed since then.
   Pan Am's creditors asked Mr. McHugh to return because he
is viewed as a person more familiar with the myriad issues
still unresolved at the bankrupt airline, he said in an
interview. Mr. McHugh said that one of his first duties will
be "to determine whether to go forward with litigation."
