New York City Real Estate
   Fell in Value Since 1990
The Manhattan office market, which accounts for 30% of the
value of all the assessed property in the city, fell by 2.7%
in 1991.
   The market value of a typical home fell to $206,430 from
$227,120, which still makes New York City one of the most
expensive places to live in the country.
   The drop in assessed valuations won't necessarily mean
lower property taxes because previous increases in assessed
valuations are still being phased in.
