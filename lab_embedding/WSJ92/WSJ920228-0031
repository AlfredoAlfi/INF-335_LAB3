Marketing  Media:
   Saks Will Launch
   A/X Armami Stores
   In Boston, Chicago
"This is a new effort by Saks Fifth Avenue to grow the
business," Philip Miller, vice chairman and chief operating
officer, said. Mr. Miller said Saks is also exploring other
opportunities to operate free-standing stores that don't bear
the Saks name.
   Earlier this month, Saks, Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus
opened 11 A/X Armani Exchange departments across the country.
Mr. Armani, who launched a freestanding A/X Armani Exchange
store in downtown Manhattan in December, created the new line
of moderate-priced casual clothes to reach customers who
can't afford his more expensive lines.
   "We will build these stores with our own capital," added
Arthur Martinez, vice chairman of Saks. "Our commitment is to
stock them with A/X Armani Exchange merchandise."
   Saks is a unit of Investcorp International Inc., a Bahrain
investment company that earlier this week agreed to invest
$300 million of new equity in the specialty store retailer.
   Mr. Armani has licensed A/X Armani Exchange and Armani
jeans to Simint U.S.A., a division of Simint S.p.A., a
publicly traded company in Modena, Italy. Mr. Armani owns a
20% stake in Simint.
