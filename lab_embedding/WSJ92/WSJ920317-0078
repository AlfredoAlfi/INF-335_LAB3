International Brief -- Telecom:
   Argentina Is Selling Stake
   In Private Phone Company
The sale is projected to raise $640 million to $1 billion
-- enough to vault Telecom to the top five on the Buenos
Aires exchange when its stock is traded there at the end of
the month. The government set the bottom price for each
Telecom share at 2.17 pesos ($2.24). If no one bids more than
the minimum, the government would receive $640 million if all
295 million shares are bought. But if bidding goes higher,
the sale could fetch close to $1 billion.
