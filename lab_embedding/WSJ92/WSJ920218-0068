International Brief -- Hanson PLC:
   British Firm Tells Analysts
   Units Are Performing Well
Lord White, executive chairman of Hanson Industries, the
company's U.S. operation, reaffirmed that David Clarke will
succeed him. However, a spokesman stressed that the
succession was "some time off."
   James Ritchie, conglomerates analyst at London's
UBS-Phillips  Drew said he isn't changing any of his
earnings expectations for the company. "We're calling the
stock a hold on a medium to longer-term view," he said.
   Beazer PLC, which Hanson acquired last August, stands to
benefit from infrastructure spending on road and bridge
projects mandated in a new U.S. transport bill. Beazer is the
largest aggregates company in the U.S.
