Business Brief -- NEC Corp.:
   Local, U.S.-Made Products
   To Meet European Demand
At this point, NEC doesn't have enough local production
capacity to meet all of the anticipated demand. But he said,
depending on market conditions, the continued shift toward
local supply could eventually result in the suspension of
Japanese exports of 4-megabit DRAMs to Europe, where Japanese
semiconductors are under tough price competition from Korean
and other makers. "But that would be a result, not an aim,"
he said.
