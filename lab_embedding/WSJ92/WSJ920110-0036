AMR Corp. Is Planning
   Five-Million-Share Offer
The company said the offering will be managed by Goldman,
Sachs  Co. In composite trading yesterday on the New York
Stock Exchange, AMR closed at $71.375, down $2.
   Industry analysts think the offering is well-timed. One
analyst said the airline giant needs to increase its capital
base because its debt-to-capital ratio was "creeping up a
bit."
   In January 1991, AMR issued five million new shares at
about $51.50 a share, as well as a $1.15 million Liquid Yield
Option Note, similar to a zero-coupon bond that pays no
interest until maturity. AMR also raised hundreds of millions
of dollars in additional financing.
   In November the airline amended its five-year capital
spending plan by passing up options for 93 jets with a total
value of $5.2 billion. Other capital spending was cut by $3
billion.
