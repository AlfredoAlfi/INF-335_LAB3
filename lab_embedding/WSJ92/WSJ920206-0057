International Brief -- Kansallis-Osake-Pankki:
   Finnish Bank Posts a Loss
   For '91, Its First Since 1894
The KOP group plunged to a loss of 1.73 billion markkaa
last year from year-earlier net income of 326.1 million
markkaa. The board voted to omit a dividend for 1991, the
first missed payout any KOP executive could recall.
   Yesterday's news conference in Helsinki marked a downbeat
debut for Pertti Voutilainen, KOP's new chief executive
officer and a former mining executive who succeeded Jaakko
Lassila Jan. 1.
   In an interview, Mr. Voutilainen said a surge in
bankruptcies among small and medium-sized Finnish companies
late last year swelled KOP's credit losses, and he warned
that hefty loan-loss provisions probably will keep KOP in the
red this year.
