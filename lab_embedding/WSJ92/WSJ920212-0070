   Olsten Names Ligouri
   To Post of Chairman
Under Mr. Liguori's stewardship, the company significantly
expanded its home health-care business. The December 1990
acquisition of Upjohn Corp.'s health-care services business
for $58 million tripled Olsten's business base in health
care, the company said.
   The post of vice chairman won't be filled, Olsten said.
Stuart Olsten continues as president and chief operating
officer.
   Mr. Liguori began his career as controller for Olsten in
1971. He became chief operating officer in 1983 and was named
president in 1986.
