Key Centurion Bancshares Inc.
Key Centurion said the stock repurchases can start
immediately.
   The bank holding company said it saw distinct gains,
namely on an improved return on equity and in increased
per-share earnings, from the previous repurchase program, and
it expects similar benefits from the new buy-back plan.
