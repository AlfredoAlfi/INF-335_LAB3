B.F. Saul III Settles
   SEC Civil Charges
   And Will Pay $38,438
In addition, the agency settled its case against Mr.
Saul's former roommate, Peter Garvy, who will pay $93,877 in
alleged profits, penalties and interest. They both settled
without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   The SEC sued Mr. Saul III and Mr. Garvy with insider
trading in connection with B.F. Saul Real Estate Investment
Trust's 1988 acquisition by Westminster Investment Corp. The
SEC alleged that Mr. Saul obtained inside information about
the pending deal from his father, B. Francis Saul II, and
passed it on to Mr. Garvy, who then bought the stock and
earned a profit of about $38,438.
   The SEC enforcement effort ironically was triggered by a
complaint from the senior Mr. Saul, who complained to the
agency that the stock price had run up just before the deal
was announced. When the SEC traced back the source of the
trades, they uncovered Mr. Garvy's account, in turn leading
them back to the alleged tip from the younger Mr. Saul.
   A lawyer for Mr. Saul III, B. Scott Custer Jr., said his
client "felt it was better to get this behind him." He added
that the younger Mr. Saul has gone to work with his family in
its real estate and savings-and-loan business.
