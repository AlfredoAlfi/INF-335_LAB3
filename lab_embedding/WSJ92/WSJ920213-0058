Business Brief -- General Motors Corp.:
   Hughes Aircraft to Combine
   Two Units to Reduce Costs
The two divisions have a combined employment of 950
persons. A spokesman said layoff plans haven't been worked
out. Jeffrey E. Grant, Hughes vice president and president of
the Industrial Electronics Group, said the move is part of
Hughes's "efforts to adjust to the downturn in the company's
core businesses." He added: "Combining staffs and other
resources will eliminate duplication of support functions,
thus reducing fixed costs."
