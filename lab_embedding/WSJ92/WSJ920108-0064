Business Brief -- AMR Corp.:
   Carrier May Introduce
   Business Class in U.S.
An AMR spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas, declined to
comment, but two senior executives of the carrier have
scheduled a news conference in New York today. According to
gold-embossed invitations mailed out recently, they'll unveil
a "new dimension" in domestic service.
   Business-class service currently is a staple of
international flights, where it is considered a powerful
marketing tool in luring full-fare passengers.
