Robson Leads the Field
   In Super Bowl Options
Mr. Robson had 990 points at game's end. William Yuen,
manager of foreign exchange strategic planning for Eastman
Kodak Co. in Rochester, N.Y., had 965 points, topping the
traders who played by phone. Both Mr. Robson and Mr. Yuen won
trips to Paris for two.
   A story about the Super Bowl options market appeared in
this newspaper on Thursday.
   Mr. Robson, aged 31, based his trading strategy on his
belief that the Washington Redskins would steadily build up
their victory margin over the Buffalo Bills. He bought
futures contracts and options that would pay off if
Washington's margin over Buffalo widened to more than about
20 points, which it did. He sold these contracts in the
fourth quarter when the team's margin of victory was nearly
at its widest. He also sold another type of option that
declined in value if Buffalo were losing, which meant he kept
the points "paid" by the trader who bought them.
   The bank estimated that about 12,000 futures contracts and
38,000 options contracts traded during the game Sunday
evening.
