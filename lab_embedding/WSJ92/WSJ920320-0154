Smith Barney Chairman
   Got 44% Pay Rise in 1991
Indeed, the performance of Smith Barney -- whose net
income tripled to a record $139.2 million -- was so strong
that Mr. Zarb's pay outpaced that of his boss, Primerica
Chairman Sanford I. Weill. Mr. Weill earned $2.2 million in
cash compensation, up 22% from the year earlier's $1.8
million. Primerica, an insurance and financial services
company, also posted record profit last year.
   The proxy noted, however, that Mr. Weill was paid an
additional $219,914 in other compensation that pushed his
total compensation above Mr. Zarb's. This included "financial
planning services, use of company transportation,
supplemental medical benefits and life insurance premiums."
