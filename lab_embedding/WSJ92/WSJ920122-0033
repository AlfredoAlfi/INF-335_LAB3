Retiree Group Sues Hughes
   Over Pension Plan Assets
A spokesman for Los Angeles-based Hughes said the company
didn't have any immediate comment on the suit. A Los Angeles
court dismissed an action brought by the same group last year
in an effort to obtain the names and addresses of all
salaried employees, the spokesman said.
   The group, the Hughes Salaried Retirees Action Committee,
is based in Tucson. One of its leaders, Stan Jacobson, said
last year that the group is worried that General Motors
Corp., which acquired Hughes in 1985, might terminate the
Hughes pension plan or combine it with a GM pension plan.
About 10,000 Hughes Aircraft retirees would be adversely
affected, he said. Hughes said it doesn't plan any changes in
its retirement plans.
   Mr. Jacobson and other committee members couldn't be
reached for comment.
