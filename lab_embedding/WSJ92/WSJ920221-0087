   Nevada Power Says
   Financial Chief, Hyte,
   Resigns From His Post
The utility, Nevada's largest, didn't immediately name a
successor.
   The departure of Mr. Hyte, 47 years old, comes amid
mounting challenges at Nevada Power. In November, state
regulators granted only 40% of a rate increase requested by
the utility. Standard  Poor's Corp. later downgraded some of
the company's debt, citing Nevada Power's "frail financial
profile."
   The disappointing rate increase prompted the company to
take a $3.8 million charge, which resulted in fourth-quarter
net income of $319,000. That compared with a loss of $18
million the year earlier.
