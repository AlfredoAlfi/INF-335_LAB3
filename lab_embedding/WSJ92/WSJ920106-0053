AFL-CIO Council Resolves
   Dispute Over Meeting Site
But the local unions have resolved the impasse, an AFL-CIO
official said, by reaching a settlement with the hotel that
includes an agreement for unionized maintenance work.
   So the AFL-CIO said the council meeting will be held the
week of Feb. 17 at the Sheraton Bal Harbour, the site of the
meeting since the 1950s. The unions' agreement with the hotel
averted the threat of picketing of the executive council by
the locals, which would have killed the meeting for the hotel
because council members wouldn't have crossed union picket
lines.
