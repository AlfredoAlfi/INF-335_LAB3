Program Trading
Of the program trading total on the Big Board, 49.4%
involved stock-index arbitrage, up from 48.8% the prior week.
In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index
options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 49.8% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 39.3%
involved trading for customers. An additional 10.9% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, four did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities, UBS Securities,
Kidder Peabody and Bear Stearns.
