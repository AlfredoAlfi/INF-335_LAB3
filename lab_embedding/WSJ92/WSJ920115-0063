Bausch  Lomb Sets
   $125 Million Charge
   For Fourth Quarter
The new accounting rule, No. 106 by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the chief rule-maker for
accounting, requires companies to set aside money for retiree
life and health insurance in advance, instead of paying as
they go.
   About $37 million of the total charge will be used to
write off good will for Bausch  Lomb's troubled Pharmafair
Inc. acquisition. The maker of generic opthalmic
pharmaceuticals has been plagued by start-up costs at its new
Tampa plant, which had a loss between $12 million and $15
million last year because it is waiting for Food and Drug
Administration approval to begin production.
   The remaining $27 million of the total charge will be used
to restructure two small product lines and pay potential
litigation costs. The product lines are Sight Savers, which
makes accessories for glasses, and Interprobe, which makes
dental tools.
   The potential litigation costs relate to Houston
Instruments, a unit that Bausch  Lomb sold in 1984. Several
companies are suing Bausch  Lomb, charging that Houston
Instruments infringed on their patents to make a part for a
graphics printer.
