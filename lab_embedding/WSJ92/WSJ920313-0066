ATT's Operators
   Protest Firm's Plans
   To Cut Their Jobs
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The job action by the operators, all members of the
Communications Workers of America, underscores the bitterness
of ATT's feud with its largest union. And it shows the
resistance the company is getting from workers as it attempts
to modernize. The timing isn't very convenient either: ATT
will in a couple of weeks enter negotiations with the CWA
over a new three-year contract.
   "We hope to keep ATT from putting these people out in the
street and instead open up jobs that are currently going to
non-union folks at other ATT units," said a spokeswoman at
CWA. She noted that new phone technology allows ATT
operators to take calls from anywhere in the country "rather
than having to move and disrupting lives and families."
   "We sympathize with their situation," an ATT spokesman
said. "On the other hand they didn't mention that anytime a
caller wants a live operator with the new system all he has
to say is `operator.'" He said the action didn't disrupt
ATT's normal daily volume of six to seven million
operator-assisted calls.
