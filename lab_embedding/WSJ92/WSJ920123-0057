Credit Ratings:
   Debt of Chrysler, Unit
   Gets Lower Ratings
   At Moody's Investors
Moody's said the downgrade was forced by Chrysler's
losses, the poor U.S. auto market and increasing competition
faced by Chrysler's top-selling vehicles. In addition,
Moody's expressed concern that the Chrysler Financial unit
was being hurt by the parent company's financial squeeze, and
that this could hurt the unit's ability to finance new
Chrysler cars.
