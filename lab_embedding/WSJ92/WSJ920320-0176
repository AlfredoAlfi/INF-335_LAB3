Equimark Officers Assured
   Of `Golden Parachutes'
Under the new payment plan, severance payment would be
three times the sum of the officer's highest rate of annual
base salary plus the officer's average bonus earned over the
prior three years or, if greater, the officer's target bonus

vote on a nonbinding proposal to block executives from
collecting severance pay if the bank's return on equity in
the three years before is below 8%.
