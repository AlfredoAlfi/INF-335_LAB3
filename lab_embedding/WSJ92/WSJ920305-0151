Clarendon Decides
   Not to Seek Contracts
   To Supply U.S. Mint
The Mint's records show that since 1988, Clarendon has
been awarded $45.5 million in contracts to supply copper,
nickel and zinc for coins.
   In the wake of the protest from Capitol Hill, the Mint
recently sought information from Clarendon so it could learn
more about Mr. Rich's ties to the company. But a lawyer for
Clarendon, in a letter to the Mint late last week, said the
company doesn't plan "to participate in . . . contract
opportunities with the Mint in the foreseeable future."
Therefore, the lawyer said that "there appears to be no need
to pursue" such information.
   A Mint spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the
lawyer's letter.
   Rep. Robert Wise (D., W.Va.) said he wasn't satisfied with
the company's response. In a letter to several senior
government officials, Mr. Wise asked, "What steps will be
taken to ensure that other federal entities are protected
from dealing with a firm possibly connected to a fugitive?"
Mr. Wise is chairman of a House subcommittee on government
information and justice that has been pressuring the Mint to
bar Clarendon from obtaining new contracts.
