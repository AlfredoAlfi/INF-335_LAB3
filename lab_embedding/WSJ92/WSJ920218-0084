Hachette Sells Unit to U.S. Firm
Krames, which is specialized in the medical publishing
field, is a unit of Grolier Inc., which was taken over by the
French group in 1988.
   The Hachette official said the sale is in line with
Grolier's strategy to refocus its activity on its core
businesses of publishing encyclopedias and books for younger
readers.
   Hachette has been weakened by heavy losses incurred by La
Cinq, a 25%-owned French television station.
