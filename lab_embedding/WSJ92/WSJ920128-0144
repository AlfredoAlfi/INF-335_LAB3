Business Brief:
   Two Nynex Units
   Will Pay $250,000
   In FCC Settlement
The association, known as NECA, serves as a clearinghouse
to distribute access charges paid by long-distance companies
to local phone companies. The access charges cover costs of
using local phone networks to complete long-distance calls.
   A Nynex spokesman said that the two phone companies didn't
benefit from the alleged violations and that phone customers
weren't harmed. The phone companies, he said, "believed at
the time that they were acting consistently with FCC
accounting rules," and that both sides agreed to a consent
decree to avoid prolonged litigation.
   Last year, the FCC settled similar charges with Pacific
Telesis Group's Pacific Bell unit. No agreement has yet been
reached with Southwestern Bell Telephone, a unit of
Southwestern Bell Corp.
