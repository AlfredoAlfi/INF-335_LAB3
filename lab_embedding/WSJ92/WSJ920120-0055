Business Brief:
   Dassault Aviation,
   Raytheon Emerge
   As Cessna Bidders
Officials of Dassault, partly controlled by the French
government, said the price offered was "reasonable," but
didn't elaborate.
   A spokesman for Cessna, based in Wichita, Kan., said
negotiations for an acquisition of the company are in the
"final stages," but he declined to confirm the names of any
bidders. "Cessna is optimistic that a new owner will be named
by Feb. 1, and maybe sooner," he said.
   Cessna's parent, based in Falls Church, Va., said last
fall that it planned to divest itself of the profitable
Cessna division to focus on its core defense businesses.
   When Cessna was put on the block in October, analysts
figured it would fetch $500 million to $700 million,
depending on the type of transaction involved. The unit,
which has a 60% world-wide market share in light and medium
business jets, is expected to have generated more than $800
million in sales and as much as $100 million in profit in
1991.
