Credit Ratings:
   Moody's Hospital Ratings
   Were Mostly Lower in '91
During 1991, Moody's downgraded 31 hospital bond ratings
and upgraded 11.
   Although it saw signs of some stabilization in the
industry, Moody's said it expects the negative ratings trend
to continue as hospitals struggle with costs outpacing
reimbursements levels, and with increasing competition.
