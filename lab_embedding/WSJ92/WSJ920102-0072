Breakwater Can't Pay Interest
It said it hoped to persuade creditors to convert some of
their debt into equity.
   Breakwater had 83.8 million Canadian dollars (US$72.4
million) of liabilities as of Sept. 30, excluding deferred
income taxes. It reported a loss of C$16 million for the nine
months ended Sept. 30, mostly because of weak metals prices.
   Executives of the company weren't available for comment.
