Boston Edison Holders to Vote
The Otts said the plant should be shut down for health and
safety reasons related to the obsolescence of the plant and
Edison's management of it. Pilgrim began operating in
December 1972. In 1986, the plant closed for 32 months after
a series of technical and management problems.
   A spokesman for Boston Edison declined to comment on the
resolution, which will serve as a recommendation to the
board.
