International:
   Polish Bank Founder
   Is Arrested on Charge
   Of U.S. Tax Evasion
The arrest was requested by the U.S. Justice Department.
   Mr. Bogatin's lawyer, Kazimierz Lojewski, said he plans to
appeal the decision to hold his client. Mr. Bogatin, 46 years
old, suffered a mild heart attack after the ruling and is now
hospitalized in Warsaw, Mr. Lojewski said.
   Based in Lublin, Mr. Bogatin's bank, which claims to have
more than $100 million in deposits, is generally believed to
be in good financial health; it can probably count on
short-term support if another run develops. The central bank
has repeatedly said that deposits in the bank would be
protected.
   Since launching radical economic reforms two years ago,
Poland has been plagued by scandals caused by a failure of
regulations to keep pace with the development of a capitalist
financial system. Last year, Poland's central bank chairman
was arrested because of his alleged failure to control
abuses.
   Having admitted evading $5 million in state and federal
taxes, Mr. Bogatin jumped bail of $500,000 just before
sentencing. He had faced a prison term of up to eight years.
   Mr. Bogatin, who came to Poland in 1987, also launched a
successful frozen-food exporting business. His bank, set up
in 1990, is one of 58 joint-stock banks licensed to operate
in Poland and one of seven partly owned by foreign capital.
