Business Brief -- RTZ Corp.:
   Kennecott Unit Will Build
   Smelter for $880 Million
A bottleneck in copper production has developed world-wide
in the past year, slowing the refining of copper concentrates
and at least doubling the cost of smelting for companies that
don't have their own smelter capacity. Kennecott's new
smelter will help ease that situation and will make it
possible for the company to refine all of its own production
from its Bingham Canyon mine. About 40% of the mine's current
output is exported for smelting.
   The project will require environmental permits from state
and federal governments. Kennecott said the engineering and
permitting process will take about a year to complete.
