Canada Manufacturers
   Post Further Drops
   In Orders, Shipments
Shipments declined 0.7% in December, led by a 4.9% drop in
shipments of refined oil and coal products.
   The manufacturers' figures were the latest indication of
persisting weakness in the Canadian economy. The government
has forecast that the economy will grow slowly in the first
half of this year but pick up strength in the second half. It
expects 1992 to show economic growth of 2.7%.
