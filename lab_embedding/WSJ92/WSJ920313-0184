   Declined 29% in 1991;
   Lower Prices Cited
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Despite the decline, Enterprise raised its dividend 5% to
15.75 pence from 15 pence.
   Enterprise linked the earnings drop largely to an 8%
decline in the average sterling price realized on its oil, to
#11.88 a barrel from #12.91 a year earlier. The company said
that, "in real terms, sterling oil prices last year were
lower than they were at the time of the last oil price
collapse in 1986."
   Exploration costs eased 5.9% to #69.6 million from #74
million, but administrative expenses rose 20% to #19.7
million from #16.4 million, contributing to a 46% drop in
operating profit to #70.3 million from #129.3 million in
1990.
   Pretax profit in the latest year dropped 46% to #114.4
million from #210.3 million. The decline was fueled by a 41%
rise in interest expense to #45.7 million from #32.4 million
in 1990.
   Enterprise Oil noted that capital spending rose 24% to
#470.4 million last year, including #126.6 million at Elf
Enterprise Petroleum Ltd., a joint venture with France's
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, which acquired Occidental
Petroleum Inc.'s North Sea assets in May.
   The spending also included further outlays for the
development of the Nelson and Scott oilfields in the North
Sea.
   Group oil and gas production rose 11.5% last year to
131,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Proven reserves
rose to 948.3 million barrels of oil equivalent, up 0.4% from
944.4 million at the end of 1990.
