International Brief -- Aerospatiale S.A.:
   Company Says It's in Talks
   With Bank About Alliance
For 1991, Aerospatiale posted a 16% rise in consolidated
revenue to 38 billion francs from 32.8 billion in 1990,
chiefly reflecting an increase in deliveries of Airbus
commercial jets. New orders slumped 50% to 28 billion francs
from 55 billion francs.
   Mr. Martre indicated that Aerospatiale had remained
profitable in 1991, but he couldn't be more specific.
Aerospatiale had a net profit of 38 million francs in 1990.
   Mr. Martre said he expects the company's revenue to grow
at an average annual rate of 10% in the next three years to
reach 49 billion francs in 1994. He said that partly
reflecting reduced French military spending, the company is
going through a change that will make it more dependent on
civilian export markets.
