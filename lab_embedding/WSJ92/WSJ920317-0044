Business Brief -- USTrails Inc.:
   Help Offered to Refinance
   Notes of Thousand Trails
USTrails' plan calls for it to raise as much as $12.5
million through a private placement to help repay Thousand
Trails' debt and for it to acquire the remaining Thousand
Trails shares outstanding without a special vote of minority
shareholders. The transactions would be contingent on
USTrails raising the necessary funds and on the approval of a
special committee of Thousand Trails' board.
   USTrails, formerly Naco Finance Corp., owns a campground
and resorts operator.
