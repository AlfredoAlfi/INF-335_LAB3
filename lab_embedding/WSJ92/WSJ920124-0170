Garuda Indonesia
   Decides Not to Invest
   In Australian Airline
"Garuda Indonesia doesn't wish to prolong its evaluation
for fear of creating false hopes or diverting the attention
of other potential investors," it said.
   Compass, the sole new participant since the deregulation
of Australia's aviation industry in November 1990, collapsed
Dec. 20 when it couldn't meet payments.
   Ian Ferrier, the provisional liquidator and senior partner
at Ferrier Hodgson, said this month that there was more than
a 50% chance of finding a new major shareholder for Compass,
but that if one isn't found, the airline won't survive.
   The liquidator said that the airline's deficiency of
liabilities over assets would be 171.2 million Australian
dollars (US$128.8 million) if the business ceases but only
A$45.2 million if it continues as a going concern.
