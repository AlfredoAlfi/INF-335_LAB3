   Let the `Chips' Quote
   Fall on Whom It May
I have heard Mr. Prestowitz and other managed-trade mavens
use this remark in past public statements. The difference is
that then, "potato chips" was substituted for "wood chips"
and Michael Boskin, the chairman of the Council for Economic
Advisers, was the alleged speaker as opposed to the unnamed
cookie-pusher at the State Department.
   Can Mr. Prestowitz or one of his colleagues enlighten us
regarding who precisely made such an inane statement and what
the context of that statement was? Until the quipster is
unmasked once and for all, I, at least, am bound to conclude
that the quote is a hoax.
   There is reason enough to criticize prevailing American
trade and investment policy without reheating old gossip.
