Economy:
   Boskin Suggests Fed
   Consider New Steps
   If Economy Stays Soft
The government is scheduled to release its employment
report for January today, and retail sales figures and
industrial production and capacity utilization for last month
are scheduled to be released next week. Those figures may
likely reflect the impact of the aggressive interest rate
cuts made by the Fed in late December.
   Mr. Boskin blamed the current weakness in the economy, in
part, on the Fed's slow approach to lowering interest rates
throughout last year as the economy struggled to regain
steam. "In retrospect," Mr. Boskin said, the Fed "should have
eased sooner and more aggressively."
