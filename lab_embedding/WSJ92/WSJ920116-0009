Money Fund Assets
   Rose During Week,
   But Yields Declined
The inflow came largely from institutional investors
seeking the slight yield advantage that money-market funds
offer over open market rates, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor
of the Ashland, Mass., newsletter.
   The average seven-day compound taxable yield dropped to
4.28% from 4.49% in the week ended Tuesday, Donoghue's said.
The average 30-day compound yield eased to 4.51% from 4.62%.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
   Meanwhile, the average seven-day simple yield of the
taxable money funds dove to 4.19% from 4.40%, and the average
30-day simple yield eased to 4.41% from 4.52%.
   The average maturity of the investments in the taxable
funds' portfolios increased by one day, to 57 days, according
to Donoghue's. The funds invest in commercial paper
(short-term corporate IOUs), short-term bank certificates of
deposit and Treasury bills.
   Meanwhile, assets of 293 tax-free funds increased by $2.3
billion to $97.4 billion.
   The average seven-day compound yield of tax-free funds
dropped to 3.04% from 3.89%. The latest yield is equivalent
to 4.22% on a taxable investment for someone in the 28% tax
bracket and to 4.54% for those paying 31% in taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-free funds' investments
fell by two days, to 53 days.
