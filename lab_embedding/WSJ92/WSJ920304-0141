Notable  Quotable
{Former New York mayor Ed} Koch was leaving a midtown
restaurant recently when a passerby -- obviously no fan of
David Dinkins' -- called out to him, urging him to get back
in office to "save the city," says a source.
   The ex-mayor didn't miss a beat, says the insider. "The
people threw me out," Koch shot back. "And now the people
must be punished."
