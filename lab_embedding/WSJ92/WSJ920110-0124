Czechoslovak Truck Maker
   And Mercedes Sign Pact
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Mercedes, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, on Monday signed a
letter of intent to form a joint venture with Avia Praha, a
Czechoslovak maker of lighter trucks. The two deals together
would give Mercedes a huge part of the Czechoslovak
truck-manufacturing business.
   With the first deal, which is still being negotiated,
Mercedes said it would spend about 350 million marks ($232
million) in updating the Avia plant, and take an initial 31%
stake in the venture.
   A spokesman for Mercedes said that Liaz would be
integrated into the venture between Mercedes and Avia Praha.
