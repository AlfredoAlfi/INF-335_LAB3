Who's News:
   JWP Picks Copperman
   As Chief Executive
   Of Businessland Unit
Mr. Copperman, 44, joined JWP in July after stints at
Apple Computer Inc., International Business Machines Corp.
and Commodore International Ltd.
   JWP, a technical services company, bought Businessland in
August and embarked on an ambitious turnaround of the
beleaguered chain.
   Mr. Crowell said that since the Businessland purchase JWP
has been able to trim its merged work force by 15% to 20%. He
said JWP Businessland's fourth-quarter results were better
than expected and said demand for computers is rising. The
company said JWP Businessland had 1991 revenue of about $1.8
billion.
   In an interview, Mr. Copperman said he wants to
concentrate on pushing Businessland further into maintenance,
technical support and other service areas.
   Mr. Crowell's decision to leave JWP wasn't a surprise in
the computer industry. Seymour Merrin, a Palo Alto, Calif.,
computer-retail consultant, said Mr. Crowell was considered
an expert low-cost salesman, but Businessland needs more
emphasis on service and support today.
