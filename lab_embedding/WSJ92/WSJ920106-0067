Business Brief -- Lukens Inc.:
   Unit and Steelworkers Local
   Reach Tentative Labor Pact
Details of the agreement won't be released until the
local's 1,338 members review it tomorrow; a ratification vote
will follow. Lukens's main plate-steel plant has been
operated by supervisory personnel and replacement workers
since company workers struck Oct. 1.
   The union is seeking a bolstered wage-and-benefits
package, enhanced retirement benefits and protection against
use of nonunion labor at the plant.
