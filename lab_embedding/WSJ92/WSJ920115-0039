International Brief -- Hyundai Motor Co.:
   Workers Vote to Strike,
   Defying Seoul's Warning
Union leaders said a work slowdown already under way would
be stepped up today. Hyundai called the slowdown illegal.
   Labor Minister Choi Byung-yul warned that police would be
used, if necessary, to end the Hyundai dispute. Several
hundred riot police were deployed near gates at the sprawling
plant, witnesses said.
   Disputes began at the plant in Ulsan, about 200 miles
southeast of Seoul, in mid-December, when the union demanded
extra year-end bonuses. Union members have rejected overtime
and slowed their work, effectively crippling car production,
company officials said.
   Hyundai management says it cannot afford additional
bonuses.
   In 1991, Hyundai Motor recorded total sales of $7.7
billion, up from $6.1 billion in 1990. But the company says
profits were small because of high labor costs and lost
production.
