Law:
   U.S. Judge Dismisses
   Creditors' Challenge
   To BCCI Plea Deal
Creditors and claimants to the money in the U.S. and
overseas challenged the agreement in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York, saying that the U.S. government is keeping too much
money for itself at the expense of the bank's depositors. The
matter was before the court because BCCI had gone there in
August seeking protection from U.S. creditors' claims.
   The decision, by U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge James L.
Garrity Jr., followed nearly two days of hearings in New
York.
   Creditors and claimants said they still would object to
the plea agreement today before Judge Joyce Green in
Washington, who is to decide whether to approve the accord.
The creditors also said they would seek an emergency appeal
of the bankruptcy judge's ruling.
