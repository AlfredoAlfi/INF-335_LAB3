Arco's Top Officials
   Had '91 Incentive Pay
   Cut by About 50%
Mr. Cook also received more than $2 million last year
through the exercise of stock options, a figure that an Arco
spokesman described as unusually high for the executive.
   The bonus cuts reflected the company's poor performance in
1991 compared with prior years, the company said. "The
management faced up to reality," the spokesman said, noting
that the decline in Arco's operating results stemmed from low
crude oil prices.
   For 1991, Arco reported a 65% decline in net income to
$709 million, or $4.39 a share, which included after-tax
charges of $295 million from property sales, writedowns and
personnel cuts. Revenue dropped to $18.16 billion from $18.8
billion in 1990.
