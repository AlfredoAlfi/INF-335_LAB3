Northwest Air Alters Fares
Other airlines could follow. "The carrier with the lowest
fare will show up in the software that most travel agents
have, and that's not acceptable to most major carriers," said
Thomas Longman, airline industry analyst at Bear Stearns 
Co.
   Northwest's vice president for revenue management, Phil
Haan, said the 30-day advance purchase fares will become "a
permanent part of the Northwest fare structure." The level of
the fares will depend on mileage and markets.
   Northwest will more than make up for the costs of the fare
cuts by eliminating its seven-day advance purchase excursion
fares. However, it will keep its higher-priced, seven-day
advance purchase business fares -- which don't require a
Saturday night stay, as do the excursion fares.
