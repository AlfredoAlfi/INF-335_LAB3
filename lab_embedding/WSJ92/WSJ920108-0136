Already, under a federal law that took effect last year,
all drug makers provide an estimated 12.5% price rebate to
state Medicaid programs, which provide health care coverage
to the poor. Bristol-Myers said that in December it
determined that it paid the Medicaid programs about $50
million last year in rebates.
   Under the new offer, Bristol-Myers will reduce prices of
all its medicines to Veterans Affairs Hospitals, military
health centers and federally funded clinics providing
services for mental health, migrant workers, drug abuse,
native Americans and other programs.
   Bristol-Myers said it expected the new program to increase
its total price discounts to $80 million in 1992. The company
said, for instance, that under its program it would sell a
bottle of 100 tablets of its heart drug Capoten for $34, down
from $45.40 it charges private pharmacies.
   The drug industry has come under fire of late because drug
prices over the past few years have jumped at three times the
rate of inflation for all consumer products. As a result of
complaints, Merck  Co. recently promised that price
increases of its products won't rise faster than the
inflation rate, and the drug industry's trade group also
asked its members to consider expanding the Medicaid rebate
to all federal agencies. Bristol-Myers appeared to be the
first company to follow the trade group's request.
