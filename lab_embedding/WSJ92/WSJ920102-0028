Group Ranks California
   First on Worker Safety
"State government has an important -- but largely
unrecognized -- role in promoting safer and healthier
workplaces," the institute said. It gave California 81 points
on a scale with a possible perfect score of 116. New Jersey
was second with 80 points, and Illinois and New York were
tied for third, with 76 points.
   Arkansas ranked at the bottom with 11 points. Second and
third worst, respectively, were Wyoming, 12 points, and New
Mexico, 14 points.
   California, New Mexico and Wyoming have been given
jurisdiction over occupational safety and health enforcement
by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
OSHA directly regulates workplace health and safety in
Arkansas, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. But all the
states control many of the programs involved in the rating
system.
