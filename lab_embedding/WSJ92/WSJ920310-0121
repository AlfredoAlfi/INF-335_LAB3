Who's News:
   Earl Scheib Inc. Elects
   Donald Scheib Chief
   And President of Firm
The company said that despite market speculation, it does
not plan to sell off its business or assets following the
death of its founder. Some observers had speculated the
company might be put on the block to pay off estate taxes, as
the elder Mr. Scheib's 37% stake in the company would likely
be divided up among his sons.
   It was unclear how the elder Mr. Scheib's stake is being
distributed. Company officials did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
   Also, Earl Scheib Inc. reported a net loss of $1.7
million, or 36 cents a share, for the third quarter ended
Jan. 31, compared with a loss of $1.9 million, or 42 cents a
share, a year ago. Revenue fell to $9.8 million from $9.9
million.
   Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli Asset Management Co. is a
major holder of Scheib stock, said the company could take
several steps to improve operations, including buying up good
shop locations and offering more services to enhance margins
on each order.
