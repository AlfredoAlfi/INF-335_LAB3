Business Brief -- FirstFed Financial Corp.:
   Fourth-Period Net Fell 32%;
   Loan-Loss Reserves Cited
For the year, net income was $28.4 million, or $2.61 a
share, a 5% increase from net income of $27 million, or $2.49
a share, in the previous year. FirstFed attributed the higher
earnings to increased net interest income and cost controls.
   Gains on interest income were offset by increases in loan
loss provisions. During 1991, $11.8 million was added to
reserves, with more than half of that figure -- $6.3 million
-- taken in the fourth quarter.
   While the year-end earnings fell short of the company's
goal of $30 million, they still represented the highest
earnings in its history. FirstFed said it expects to reach
its goal of $35 million in net income for the current year.
