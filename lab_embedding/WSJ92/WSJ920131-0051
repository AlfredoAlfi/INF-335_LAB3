Program Trading
Of the program trading total on the Big Board, 44.9%
involved stock-index arbitrage, down from 49.4% the previous
week. In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and
stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price
differences.
   Some 55.2% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 37.5%
involved trading for customers. An additional 7.3% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, three did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities, First Boston and
Kidder Peabody.
