Business Brief -- Degussa AG:
   Concern to Trim Dividend;
   Group Profit for Year Falls
Degussa had been paying a dividend of 11 marks a share
since fiscal 1989, when it raised it from 10.50 marks.
   Industry analysts had said earlier this year that the
company would find a dividend reduction unavoidable as a
result of its pressured businesses. The only question was by
how much the regular annual payout to shareholders would be
trimmed.
   Degussa had been broadly expected to post lower profit for
fiscal 1991. The company in December had said its group
pretax profit plunged 44% last year to 179 million marks as
world-wide group consolidated sales were off 4.1% to 13.35
billion marks.
   The company, like others in its business lines, has been
plagued over the past couple of years by weak markets in the
metals and chemicals sectors as well as by the weakness of
the dollar and other currencies against the Deutsche mark.
