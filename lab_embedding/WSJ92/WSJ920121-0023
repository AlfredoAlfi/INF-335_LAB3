Business Brief -- CIT Group Holdings Inc.:
   Yearly Net Increased 12%
   In 1991 to $150.1 Million
"While there is no denying that a nationwide `credit
crunch' has put a cloud over the economy, I'm . . . pleased
at the way CIT has capitalized on the cloud's silver lining
by successfully promoting the advantages that asset-based
financing offers to companies strapped for capital," said
Albert R. Gamper Jr., CIT president and chief executive. "Our
secured lending strategies reduce the risk of losses from
extending credit in these troubled times."
   The latest year included a $1.3 million after-tax charge
to redeem long-term debt; the 1990 results included a similar
charge of $5.9 million and a $20.4 million tax benefit from
an accounting change.
   Finance receivables totaled $11.52 billion, up 4.5% from a
year ago. Net interest revenue rose to a record $569.2
million, up 18% from the previous year.
