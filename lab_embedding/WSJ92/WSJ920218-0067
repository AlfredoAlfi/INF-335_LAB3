International Brief -- Fletcher Challenge Ltd.:
   Operating Profit Fell 60%
   In 1st Half; Payout Is Cut
Fletcher's first-half earnings include extraordinary
losses of NZ$32 million, consisting mainly of write-downs on
the value of properties held by one of its construction
units. Year-earlier results include extraordinary gains of
NZ$52 million.
   Weak prices for pulp and newsprint caused Fletcher's core
forestry division to record a loss of NZ$79 million in the
first half, swinging from a profit of NZ$76 million a year
earlier. Fletcher's 72% owned unit, Fletcher Challenge Canada
Ltd., has been particularly hurt by an oversupply of
newsprint on the North American market and weak demand.
