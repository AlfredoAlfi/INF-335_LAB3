Marietta Corp. Revises
   Results After Probing
   Financial Statements
The company's investigation found that previously reported
audited and unaudited financial statements for fiscal years
1987 to 1991 contained misstatments, related mostly to
overstatements of fixed assets, sales and retained earnings.
Reported earnings on a pretax basis for fiscal years 1987,
1988, and 1989 were overstated by $234,243, $251,705, and
$998,201 respectively.
   Thomas J. Blair, former vice president of finance,
allegedly embezzled $400,000 from Marietta. He was dismissed
in July 1991, when the company said it wasn't satisfied with
his professional performance. The company announced an
investigation in October into the alleged embezzlement and
misstatements in its financial records.
   The SEC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are both
investigating the alleged embezzlement, the company said.
   For fiscal 1991, Marietta had a restated net loss of $1.2
million, or 34 cents a share, after an extraordinary gain of
$724,166, or 20 cents a share, from the prepayment, at a
discount, of a convertible subordinated note. In fiscal 1990,
net income was $2.6 million, or 71 cents a share.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Marietta shares
rose 50 cents to $5.25.
