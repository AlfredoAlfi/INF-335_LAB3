SL Bailout Agency
   Expects Indictments
   Over Home Purchases
"We have a number of these cases around the country," said
Mr. Blight, "and we expect more indictments."
   According to the indictment, Mr. Burdick filed 12 sealed
bids for homes that were limited to low-income buyers. Using
the names of three people who never intended to purchase the
property, and false financial information, he won title to
three homes from the agency, the RTC said.
   Mr. Burdick didn't return a call seeking comment on the
indictment. If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced
to 10 years, and $100,000 in fines, Mr. Blight said.
   The agency, which sells the assets from failed SLs, must
set aside any homes with a value of less than $67,500 for 90
days, to allow nonprofit organizations and low-income people
to bid first for them. The low-income homes come with certain
deed restrictions, including a requirement that the buyer
live in the property for at least a year.
   The agency currently has about $141 billion in assets.
Real estate represents about $17 billion of the assets,
including roughly 20,000 single-family homes.
