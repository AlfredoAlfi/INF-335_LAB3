Business Brief -- Employers Casualty Co.:
   Regulators Seize Firm, Plan
   `Wind-Down' of Business
The Insurance Department called the seizure necessary to
protect the company's $650 million in assets. Regulators said
prudent management of those assets may avert a draw from the
Texas property and casualty insurance guaranty fund, which
pays claims of insolvent insurance companies.
   The Insurance Department said that a team will be
assembled to oversee the company and that the team will not
include existing Employers management.
   An Employers Casualty official said he didn't disagree
with the Insurance Department's decision.
   On Monday, Employers reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$35.4 million, or $3.52 a share. The loss was entirely
attributable to a $57.2 million charge taken to bolster the
company's reserve for future losses.
