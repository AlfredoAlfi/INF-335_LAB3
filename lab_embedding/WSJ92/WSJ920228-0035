Business Brief -- Novell Inc.:
   First-Period Net Rose 71%
   On Strong Software Sales
The Provo, Utah, company said the strong quarter resulted
from strong foreign sales and "very high" shipments of a
scaled-down version of Novell's flagship product, called
Netware Lite, designed to link small groups of personal
computers.
   The company also said it benefited from accelerating sales
of a version of Netware that links dissimilar computers.
Sales of Netware 3.11 grew 80% and accounted for nearly half
of first quarter revenue, Novell said.
   Novell is the biggest supplier of networking software for
personal computers. Despite increasing competition from
rivals -- including Microsoft Corp., the largest supplier of
PC software -- Novell shows no signs of loosening its grip on
the networking business.
