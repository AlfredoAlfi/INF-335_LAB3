   Will Hurt Ratings

A spokeswoman for General Motors Acceptance Corp. said
Friday that SP hadn't indicated a specific date for its
decision on whether to extend top-tier ratings for about $20
billion in GMAC commercial paper. "Monday (today) is the
earliest," she said.
   Since SP put its ratings for GM and GMAC debt on review
Nov. 7, GMAC has secured top-tier ratings for its roughly $20
billion in commercial paper outstanding from three other
credit rating agencies. That means money market funds may buy
GMAC's short-term, corporate IOUs without limitation. But
managers of some money market funds that buy only top-quality
securities have said they've reduced holdings of GMAC paper
anyway, pending SP's judgment.
   SP said it is placing bonds for the Ypsilanti, Mich.,
Community Utilities Authority and the debt for the Ypsilanti
Township Building Authority on watch for possible downgrade.
The rating agency said Ypsilanti will be among the
communities hurt the worst by GM's cutbacks. GM plans to
close its Willow Run car-assembly plant in Ypsilanti by the
summer of 1993.
   SP officials also said they will review the status of
other cities affected by GM plant closings, including Flint,
Mich.; North Tarrytown, N.Y.; Anderson, Ind.; and Dayton,
Moraine and Lordstown, Ohio. SP said it expects Ypsilanti
and Flint to suffer the most because GM makes up a large part
of their local economies.
   "In communities with imminent closings, budgetary
pressures to cut service levels in line with lost revenues
could be severe," SP analysts noted.
