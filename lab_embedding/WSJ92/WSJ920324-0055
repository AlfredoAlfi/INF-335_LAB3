Technology Brief -- Ing. C. Olivetti  Co.:
   Concern Adds New Division
   To Venture With Canon
Olivetti, the office-technology company based in Italy,
and Canon are two of the three main proponents of ink-jet
printing. Hewlett-Packard Co. of the U.S. also produces
ink-jet machines.
   Ink-jet printers, at about $500 to $700, are cheaper but
slower than laser printers that offer similar quality. They
compete mostly with noisier "dot-matrix" printers.
