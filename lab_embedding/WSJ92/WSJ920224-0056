   Sales and Profit Estimates
   For Fiscal Year Are Pared
Komatsu cited poor market conditions, notably in the U.S.,
for the revisions. The company also said that a rapid falloff
in world-wide demand for construction machinery has been
dragging on consolidated sales and profit, which include
results from the parent and its subsidiaries. Komatsu also
cited auto makers' moves to delay investing in plants and
equipment and weakening orders from other manufacturers.
   In fiscal 1991, Komatsu had group pretax profit of 85.02
billion yen, net of 31.26 billion yen and sales of 988.9
billion yen.
