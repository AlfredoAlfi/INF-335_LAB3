   Via Rights Issue
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Bowater Chairman Norman Ireland said that the moves "are
an important step forward in our increasing focus on health
care packaging and provide Bowater with a meaningful presence
in continental Europe."
   The company also reported a 0.4% slip in its 1991 pretax
profit, to #112.7 million. But the dividend was raised 4.8%
to 22 pence (39 cents) a share from 21 pence. Revenue slipped
5.3% to #1.21 billion from #1.27 billion.
   The acquisitions will boost sales by Bowater's
pharmaceutical, medical and personal-care operations to about
#370 million from #150 million, the company said.
   DRG specializes in flexible and rigid plastic packaging
for the medical and food industries. It had operating profit
of #18.7 million in 1991 on sales of #220.8 million.
   Cope Allman specializes in rigid plastic packaging for
cosmetics, pharmaceutical and personal products. It had
operating profit of #17 million for the year ended June 29,
1991, on sales of #224.5 million.
   Bowater plans to finance the purchase largely through a
1-for-3 rights issue at 605 pence a share. The pricing
represents a 21% discount off Bowater's Friday closing level
of 768 pence a share. In yesterday's trading on the London
Stock Exchange Bowater lost three pence to close at 765.
