Marketing  Media Brief -- American Express Co.:
   Firm Drops Service Pact
   With Ski Resort Operator
American Express said it canceled the service agreement
because the resort had placed "We prefer Visa" stickers on
ski-lift ticket booths and store windows although the resort
accepted American Express cards.
   "This in our view discriminates against our cardholders,"
said an American Express spokeswoman. "We are not happy with
what Visa is doing."
   But Charles K. Mayfield, Steamboat's vice president for
marketing, said he found the comments ironic, because
American Express had attempted to start a similiar promotion
with Steamboat six months ago called "We prefer American
Express."
