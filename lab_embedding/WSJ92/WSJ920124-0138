France's LVMH Says
   1991 Sales Increased
   11% to $4.06 Billion
He said the group's sales rose steeply in the second half
of 1991 after having been depressed earlier in the year by
reduced consumer spending because of the Gulf War. LVMH's
1991 first-half sales were only 5% above those of a year
before.
   In the last quarter of 1991 alone, he said, sales grew at
a rate of 19% over the year-earlier period.
   The drinks, perfume and luggage group said its cognac and
spirits division turned in the strongest growth last year
with a rise of almost 23% to 6.23 billion francs. The LVMH
spokesman said the increase reflected a steep rise in sales
in the last six months of the year, especially in Japan.
   Champagne sales rose at a more sedate 7.8% pace to 5.55
billion francs while those of the Louis Vuitton luggage
division grew by 8.9% to 4.85 billion francs.
   Perfume sales at LVMH increased 4.6% to 4.87 billion
francs.
