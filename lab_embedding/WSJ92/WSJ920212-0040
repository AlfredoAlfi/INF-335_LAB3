Business Brief -- Bear Stearns Cos.:
   New Employee Stock Plan
   To Buy 2.1 Million Shares
The new Bear Stearns plan continues a trend on Wall Street
in which publicly traded brokerage firms -- which were once
private partnerships -- are trying to bolster employee
ownership again. The firm said its 5,700 employees control
more than 30% of the company's stock.
   Through an earlier Bear Stearns ESOP set up in 1985, and
which will be folded into the new one, employees already
control 1,437,729 shares; with the new ESOP, total holdings
will account for 3.5% of the firm's 102,100,680 shares
outstanding.
