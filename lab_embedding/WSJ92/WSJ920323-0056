Business Brief -- Rosehaugh PLC:
   Refinancing Pact Reached
   With 26 Creditor Banks
Rosehaugh announced in December that it was seeking to
restructure #310 million ($527.6 million) in debts after
pretax losses widened to #226.6 million in the year ended
June 30. Rosehaugh technically was in violation of loan
covenants applying to the ratio of income to total assets.
   A Rosehaugh spokesman declined to disclose its exact
current debt levels, but acknowledged the debts are "roughly
around" the figure previously disclosed.
   The refinancing consolidates a number of bank credits
outstanding, he said. The company said the agreement also
stretches payments over "an initial period" to January 1994.
Barclays PLC, Britain's largest commercial bank, is the lead
bank in the refinancing, Rosehaugh said.
