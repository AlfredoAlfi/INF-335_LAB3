   Matsushita, ATT Talk
   Of Developing Computers
A Matsushita spokeswoman said the company could not
confirm the exact contents of its discussions with ATT, but
she denied that any final decision has been reached.
   She said Matsushita is talking with ATT about a variety
of things. Cooperation on the development of pen computers is
one of several topics under discussion with all companies,
she added.
   The spokeswoman said: "Matsushita is considering a variety
of ways to strengthen its computer operations. Among the
things we are thinking about is cooperation with American
companies or other companies. But nothing final has been
decided."
   Matsushita currently supplies laptop computers to a joint
venture involving ATT and Japan's Marubeni Corp. ATT's NCR
subsidiary was one of the first major computer companies to
announce a pen-based notepad computer.
