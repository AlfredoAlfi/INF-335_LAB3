Business Brief -- International Paper Co.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Rose;
   Year-Earlier Charge Is Cited
Net income for the quarter was $66 million, or 59 cents a
share, compared with $23 million, or 20 cents a share, in the
1990 quarter. The recent quarter included special charges of
$4 million for retiree-benefits accounting and $37 million
for severance costs stemming from the company's plan to
eliminate more than 1,000 positions from its world-wide force
of 70,000.
   Excluding the charges, fourth-quarter profit sank to $107
million from $160 million. Sales slipped 3% to $3.2 billion
from $3.3 billion.
   For the full year, net plunged to $184 million, or $1.66 a
share, from $569 million, or $5.21 a share, largely because
of the special charges, which totaled $231 million. Sales
slipped 2.3% to $12.7 billion from $13 billion.
