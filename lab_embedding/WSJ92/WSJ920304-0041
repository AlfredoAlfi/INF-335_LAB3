Credit Ratings
PHILADELPHIA ELECTRIC Co. -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. placed this Philadelphia utility's credit ratings under
review for possible upgrade because of reduced construction
outlays, more moderate capital requirements over the next few
years and limited long-term exposure to the Clean Air Act.
The review covers the ratings of $5.7 billion in securities.
Philadelphia Electric's senior debt currently is rated Baa-2.

   VF Corp. (Wyomissing, Pa.) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. raised its rating on $700 million of this apparel
maker's senior debt to single-A-3 from Baa-1. The rating
concern said VF's ability to invest in systems technology and
its focus on customer needs should give it a competitive
advantage. However, Moody's expressed reservations about the
company's reliance on the jeans business, although VF is
increasing the size of its non-jeans operations.
