Business Brief -- Smith  Nephew PLC:
   Little Changed Pretax Profit
   For Last Year Is Reported
The result was in line with previous forecasts by
analysts.
   Smith  Nephew attributed the steady results to its
orthopedic, arthroscopic and chronic wound care activites,
which were offset by volume declines linked to the British
recession, weak results from the eye and ear implant unit,
and adverse currency moves.
