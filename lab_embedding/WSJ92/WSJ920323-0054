Jerry Curry Withdraws
   Nomination as FAA Head
According to Bush administration officials, Mr. Busey also
became annoyed at Mr. Curry for some remarks Mr. Busey
interpreted as disloyal to White House Chief of Staff Samuel
Skinner. In a letter to President Bush, Mr. Curry cited
"recent personal considerations" in requesting that his name
be withdrawn.
   Mr. Curry was nominated for the FAA job Nov. 22. In a
statement, Transportation Secretary Andrew Card said he
expects President Bush to announce a new nominee soon. The
post is currently held by acting administrator Barry Harris.
