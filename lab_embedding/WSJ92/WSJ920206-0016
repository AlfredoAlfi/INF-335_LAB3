Congressional Leaders Seek
   Sweeping Reforms at CIA
Robert Gates, the new director of central intelligence, is
scheduled to offer his own revamping plan to President Bush
next month. The parallel efforts to reshape the intelligence
system virtually guarantee changes will be made soon.
   The congressional plan was offered by Senate Intelligence
Committee Chairman David Boren and House Intelligence
Committee Chairman David McCurdy, both Oklahoma Democrats.
Its centerpiece is a proposal to create a post, the Director
of National Intelligence, who would run the Central
Intelligence Agency, but also have broader powers to
supervise intelligence activities elsewhere in the
government. Perhaps most important, he also would have
increased power over the intelligence budget. Much of that
secret budget, estimated at about $30 billion, now lies
buried within the Pentagon budget and is controlled by the
secretary of defense.
