Business Brief -- Nerco Inc.:
   Firm Will Lower the Value
   Of Oil and Gas Properties
Nerco said it expects to report a loss for the quarter and
a possible loss for the year before taking into account the
lowered gas and oil valuation.
   Because of the impact of the lowered resource value, Nerco
said it amended its principal debt agreement, liberalizing
some covenants on cash flow and assets. The amount available
as of Jan. 1 for dividend payments was $100 million, Nerco
said. That amount would be raised or lowered depending on the
worth of Nerco's oil and gas properties at the quarter's end.
