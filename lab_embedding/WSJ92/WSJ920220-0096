Credit Ratings:
   Bank of Boston Debt
   Upgraded by Moody's
Bank of Boston recently reported that it reversed a
year-earlier fourth-quarter loss, posting net income of $93.5
million, or $1.20 a share, including one-time tax credits of
$77 million. That compared with a loss in the year-earlier
quarter of $187 million, or $2.58 a share, including a gain
of $21.3 million from retirement of debt.
   Moody's cited Bank of Boston's "good progress in managing
a large book of problem real estate early in the cyclical
downturn." It added, "Notwithstanding a protracted turnaround
for the New England economy and management's apparent
willingness to take on additional assets in that region,
improved earnings and resulting capital generation should
provide adequate support."
   Bank of Boston said it believes the upgrade "reflects the
positive results we have been able to achieve to date.
Building on our two consecutive profitable quarters, our goal
is to continue to reduce non-performing assets, to improve
credit quality, to cut costs and to grow revenues."
