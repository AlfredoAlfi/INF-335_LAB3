Three States Are Upheld
   In Case of Michigan Waste
Federal law requires every state to open its own disposal
site for low-level radioactive waste, or arrange to use one
in another state, by the end of this year. States that do not
comply can be cut off from using the three existing dumps, in
Nevada, Washington and South Carolina.
   Lawyers for those states argued that Michigan had not made
enough progress toward opening its own dump.
   "We're very pleased that the court agreed with us," said
Allen T. Miller, a Washington state assistant attorney
general.
   With Michigan's access to those dumps cut off, radioactive
waste producers have been storing their wastes themselves and
some are nearing capacity, said Richard Kraus, lawyer for a
group of waste generators that sued to keep using the Nevada,
South Carolina and Washington sites.
   Mr. Kraus said he does not expect Michigan to have a
disposal site ready by the end of this year. "That's
absolutely clear," he said.
   He said he would have to discuss further legal steps with
his clients.
