Eugene B. Shanks Jr., the newly named president, who
oversees trading and risk management, received a $450,000
raise to $1.65 million in 1991. Mr. Shanks received 40,000
new options currently valued at $160,000 and 13,113 in
deferred stock.

units. The bank earned $23 per $100 of equity last year, well
above most large banks.
   "If I was a shareholder I'd want to make sure Charlie
Sanford was very well rewarded," said David Joys, managing
director at the executive search firm Higdon, Joys  Mingle,
New York. "In no way is that over the top" of what Mr.
Sanford is worth, said Mr. Joys.
