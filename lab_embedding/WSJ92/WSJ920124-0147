   $174.5 Million Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
Trinova had announced on Dec. 18 that it would take a big
fourth-quarter write-off. About $105 million of the charge
came from the write-off of goodwill the company accumulated
from 20 companies it had acquired since 1970. Another $61
million of the charge related to a writing down the value of
some properties to a price at which they would sell under
current market conditions. Trinova in 1989 set a
restructuring provision to cover the sale of some assets.
Trinova also announced it will dismiss 800 employees this
year, primarily in the U.S. and Europe.
   Trinova Chairman Darryl F. Allen said that "1991 was a
tough year for Trinova as the industrial and automotive
markets we serve were at severely depressed levels and we
experienced the stretch-out or cancellation of aerospace and
defense orders." He added that Trinova began seeing some
improvement at the end of 1991 in U.S. industrial markets,
but that Europe continued to show signs of weakening.
   Mr. Allen said that, despite the earnings decline, Trinova
generated $95 million in cash flow for the year, reduced
inventories by $37 million and trimmed its payroll by 9% to
17,700 employees.
