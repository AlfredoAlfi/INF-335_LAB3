Business Brief -- Trans World Airlines:
   Airlease Says Carrier Missed
   Monthly Payment on a Jet
Airlease, a San Francisco-based partnership, said it's
been advised that the TWA lease should qualify for special
protection under section 1110 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
The partnership said the section generally requires the
Chapter 11 operator to pay outstanding rental amounts 60 days
after the date of the filing if it intends to continue using
the aircraft.
   Airlease said it owns a 50% interest in the jet,
representing 6.2% of its total assets as of Dec. 31. The
amount owed by the airline, which is based in Mount Kisco,
N.Y., isn't believed to be large. Airlease wouldn't reveal
terms of the lease, but said TWA's 1990 contract, which is
similar to its current contract, amounted to 5.6% of
Airlease's 1990 revenue of $16.3 million. That's about
$76,263 monthly. The partnership said it's "monitoring" TWA's
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
