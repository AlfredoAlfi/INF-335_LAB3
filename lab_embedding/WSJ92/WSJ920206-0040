Pacific Enterprises' Shares
   Plunge on News of Big Loss
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, shares of
the giant holding company fell $6 to $18.875 on volume of
nearly 3.2 million shares.
   Citing the announcement, two leading New York rating
agencies downgraded their ratings on Pacific Enterprises'
short-term debt and on all or some of its preferred stock.
The company said it was disappointed by the moves, but
pleased that the agencies affirmed ratings on the company's
Southern California Gas Co. securities.
   Standard  Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on all $260
million of Pacific Enterprises' preferred stock by two
notches to double-B-plus from triple-B and its ratings on
commercial paper by one notch to single-A-3 from single-A-2.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. slashed its rating to Ba-1
from Baa-1 on $150 million of preferred stock, and to Prime-3
from Prime-2 on the company's short-term debt. Pacific
Enterprises said the Moody's action appeared to affect only
the company's remarketed preferred stock.
