Who's News:
   Wilson Adds Position
   Of President at First
   City Bancorp. of Texas
Mr. Richley's departure wasn't surprising. He was brought
in by A. Robert Abboud at a time when First City had
restructured and was hoping to grow again. But, plagued by
souring loans, Mr. Abboud was ousted last March and Mr.
Wilson was named to succeed him. Since then, First City has
been cutting back operations and shrinking its assets, which
were about $9.9 billion at the end of 1991, down from more
than $13.3 billion at the end of 1990.
   A First City spokesman said the parting was "amicable and
voluntary."
