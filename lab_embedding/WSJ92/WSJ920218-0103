   ENI Names Perez de Cuellar
Mr. Cagliari said he has asked Mr. Perez de Cuellar to
advise the group on matters of international strategy and
orientation.
   "The experience that Perez de Cuellar has, his
understanding of geopolitics, and the solidity of his
international relationships are precious in helping ENI with
the difficult task of strengthening its international
strategy in line with its long term objectives in the
countries where it is active," Mr. Cagliari said.
