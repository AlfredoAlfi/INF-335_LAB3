Consumer Sentiment
   And Expectations
   Fell in Early January
The decline surprised observers who were expecting an
upturn in consumer sentiment after the Federal Reserve Bank
lowered its discount rate and the stock market boomed.
   James Winder, a money market economist with Merrill Lynch,
said the consumer study could give the Fed even more impetus
to lower interest rates in the future. "The recovery we
expect in the spring is going to be a modest one," he added.
   The University of Michigan's consumer surveys are a
subscribed service not given directly to the public. The
information disclosed last week was only for the first half
of January. Results for the entire month are expected in a
few weeks.
