   Second-Period Profit Rose
   10%, but Sales Slipped 3%
Commodore shares fell $2.375 yesterday to close at $16.625
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock's
drop came as investors wary of the personal-computer
industry's long-term prospects rushed to take profits, said
Mark Stahlman of Alex. Brown  Sons Inc. He also said sales
were well below his expectations of $425 million.
   For the six months, Commodore's earnings edged up 4% to
$45.4 million, or $1.35 a share, from $43.5 million, or $1.34
a share, but sales slipped 1.5% to $575.7 million from $584.4
million.
