   JWP Picks Ex-Official
   Of Ogden as President
   And Operations Chief
In choosing Mr. Sokol, the company is drawing on his
experience in facilities management with Ogden's large
projects.
   Mr. Sokol, 35 years old, was well-respected by analysts of
the pollution-control industry for the management team he had
built at the Ogden unit. At JWP, he succeeds Andrew T. Dwyer,
43, who remains chairman and chief executive officer. The
chief operating officer post is newly created. He also was
named a director, expanding the board to 12 members.
   Mr. Dwyer, in a statement, said that "with the rapid
growth and multinational scope of our operations, with
increased emphasis on high-technology energy and
environmental services, it was appropriate to add someone of
Mr. Sokol's unique background" to the company.
   Mr. Sokol currently is chairman, president and chief
executive officer of California Energy Co., an Omaha, Neb.,
utility company. Before joining California Energy, he was
president and chief executive officer of Ogden Projects Inc.,
which is 85%-owned by Ogden, and headed various other Ogden
businesses. Ogden Corp. provides support services to
airports, sports and entertainment facilities and industrial
facilities.
