An Alias spokeswoman said repayment of the Silicon
Graphics loan will extinguish all but 250,000 of the 1.5
million share-purchase warrants that Alias granted to the
Mountain View, Calif., company in return for the previously
reported loan.
   The spokeswoman said the shares were placed with
institutional and individual investors, with a minority being
purchased by Alias executives.
   The transaction boosts the company's shares outstanding to
about 7.2 million from 5.5 million. The shares closed Friday
at $13.125, up 87.5 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
