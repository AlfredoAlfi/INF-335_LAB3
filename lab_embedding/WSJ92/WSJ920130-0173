   BP Sets Staff Cuts at Plant
BP's chemicals division posted an operating loss of #20
million ($35.8 million) for the three months ended Sept. 30,
reversing a profit of #20 million a year ago.
   The cuts follow an internal review that highlighted the
need to make the plant more efficient, the spokesman said.
"We were overstaffed in some areas of our operations and were
not as competitive as we" should have been, he said.
