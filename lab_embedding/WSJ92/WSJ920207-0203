International:
   France's Elf Reaches
   Oil Pact With Russia
Elf will be the sole operator on an 8,000-square-mile area
east of the Volga river between the cities of Saratov and
Volgograd. Elf reaffirmed that it intends to invest several
hundred million dollars in the site, and production is
expected to begin in 1995.
   The accord was expected after statements Tuesday from
Russian Energy Minister Vladimir Lopukhin, who is
accompanying Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his
official visit to France.
