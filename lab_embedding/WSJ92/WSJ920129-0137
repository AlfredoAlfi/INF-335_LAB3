Rise in Employment Costs
   Is Little Changed in Quarter
Wages and salaries rose 0.9% in the fourth quarter, higher
than the 0.6% increase between June and September, but in
line with quarterly increases over the past few years. For
the year, wages and salaries rose 3.6%, compared with a 4.3%
rise in 1990.
   Employers also got some relief from rising benefit costs
in the last quarter and the year. They accelerated 1.2% in
the fourth quarter, the smallest quarterly gain since 1987.
For the year, benefit costs rose 5.6%, compared with the 6.7%
gain in 1990.
   All quarterly figures are adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.
