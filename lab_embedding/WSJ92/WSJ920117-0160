International:
   More Japanese Politicians
   Named in Bribery Scandal
Kyodo and Asahi said Kyowa paid Mr. Motomura the money in
April 1990 to help resolve legal problems arising from a
contract linked to building a factory.
   Earlier this week, Fumio Abe, a confidant of Mr. Miyazawa
and former secretary general of his faction in the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, was arrested for allegedly
demanding and receiving $625,000 in bribes from Kyowa.
   Two other politicians who have been named by newspapers as
alleged recipients of money from Kyowa, but not arrested or
questioned, were former Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki and Jun
Shiozaki, former state minister for the Management and
Coordination Agency. Spokesmen for the two denied receiving
the money.
