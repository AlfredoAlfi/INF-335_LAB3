Business Brief -- Tambrands Inc.:
   Fourth-Period Profit Fell
   78% on $23 Million Charge
The quarter included a one-time, $23 million charge
related to consolidation of world-wide manufacturing
operations and withdrawal from the sanitary pad and
disposable diaper business in Brazil. The charge, announced
in December, includes costs associated with job cuts and
consolidation of facilities, which are located in at least 10
countries. The company said it was leaving the pad and diaper
operations in Brazil because the Tampax business there had
reached a size where it can sustain itself without the
support of the other businesses.
