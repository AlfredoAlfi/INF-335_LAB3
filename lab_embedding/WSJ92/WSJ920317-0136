International:
   Stranded Cosmonaut Is Set
   To Return to Changed Land
When he boarded the cramped Soviet space station 10 months
ago, the flight engineer was assured that his mission would
last five months. Then, three months after he blasted off,
the 33-year-old Mr. Krikalev heard from his mission
controllers that hard-liners had launched an abortive coup to
save the Communist system.
   The space program got caught in the ensuing political
turmoil. Once-lavish funds were withheld. Mr. Krikalev was
pressured to stay up longer to save money on transport costs.
   Mr. Krikalev, whose plight was the subject of a page one
Wall Street Journal article in February, will return to a
changed nation. There are food shortages and rocketing
prices. Republics continue to squabble over just who is
responsible for what. His hometown, Leningrad, is now called
St. Petersburg.
   "I understand that for Sergei it could be a difficult
return," says Alexander Kaleri, one of the cosmonauts who
will rocket into space today. "He probably cannot conceive
what life is like here now."
