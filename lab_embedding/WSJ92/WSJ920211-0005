Business Brief -- Grafton Group Ltd.:
   Lenders Will Forgive Debt
   In Return for Stake in Unit
In addition, Mr. Hick said that Morley Blumes, currently
chief executive of Seiferts, will acquire a 20% stake in
Grafton International and take on the additional title of
president. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The restructuring reduces Grafton Group's holding in the
U.S. unit to 45% from 100%.
   Two of Grafton Group's Canadian retailing divisions,
Grafton-Fraser Inc. and Maher Inc., have protection from
creditors under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement
Act, which is similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. Grafton-Fraser is scheduled to unveil a restructuring
plan to its creditors on Friday.
