Card Confirmed by Senate
   For Transportation Post
Mr. Card, 44 years old, is a former Massachusetts state
legislator who has little transportation experience, but he
has been praised for his managerial abilities and
down-to-earth style. His ties to President Bush go back more
than a decade, and his appointment to the cabinet was seen as
a reward for longtime personal loyalty.
   He takes the transportation post at a time of turmoil and
consolidation in the airline industry. One of his first
duties will be to unravel a tangled mess concerning the job
of Federal Aviation Administrator.
   Late last year, the president nominated Jerry Curry,
currently the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, to run the FAA. But the Senate Commerce
Committee hasn't acted on his nomination and, in the
meantime, Mr. Curry has had a series of run-ins with James
Busey, the acting transportation secretary. Mr. Busey
recently asked Mr. Curry to withdraw his name from
consideration, but so far Mr. Curry has refused.
