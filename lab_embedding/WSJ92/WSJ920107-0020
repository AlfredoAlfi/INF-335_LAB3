Who's News:
   Laura Ashley Names
   Donna Moore to Head
   A Retail Division
Ms. Moore succeeds Terry Smith, 47, who left in November
as chairman and chief executive officer of the North American
operations, based in Mahwah, N.J. Before her Disney post, Ms.
Moore was vice president of stores and a director of
Williams-Sonoma Inc., a marketer of housewares and specialty
foods.
   Ms. Moore supervised the rapid growth of Disney's
merchandise chain, which grew from two stores in 1987 to 123
currently. Sales were about $120 million for 1991, she said.
U.S. sales of Laura Ashley were more than $180 million,
accounting for about 40% of total sales, Ms. Moore said.
   Ms. Moore noted that Ashley's sales have been slow and
margins weak and said her plan is to expand the Ashley line
in the U.S. and build customer service while maintaining
strong pricing. She said: "I think people will pay the right
price for quality. The discount business is not a survival
strategy in retailing."
