Oil Production in Siberia
   Dropped About 15% in `91
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Western Siberia was the largest oil-producing area in the
former Soviet Union, accounting for about 60% of the
country's total output. Rapidly falling production in the
former Soviet Union has cut severely into the region's
foreign currency earnings, adding to the economic woes of the
new Commonwealth of Independent States.
   Analysts have said that independent Russia's oil
production may soon be surpassed by that of Saudi Arabia.
They believe oil production in Russia can be stabilized only
if equipment throughout Siberia is modernized, according to
the semi-official Russian Information Agency.
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin recently passed a decree
allowing oil producers to privately sell 20% of their oil to
raise cash to improve their gear.
