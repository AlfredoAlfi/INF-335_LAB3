   Pretax Profit for '91,
   Surprising Analysts
Midland's earnings reflected a substantial second-half
upturn, when it had pretax profit of #107 million against a
loss of #71 million in the first half. This followed
provisions for bad debts of #373 million in the second half,
down from #530 million in the first half. Overall, Midland's
bad debt charge for the year, at #903 million, was 28% below
the 1990 level of #703 million.
   Midland shares rose sharply on the London Stock Exchange,
gaining 20 pence to 259 pence in late trading. Analysts
hailed the profit figures as a sign Midland is moving along
the track to recovery. But they warned that the bank still
has a long way to go before it regains a satisfactory level
of profitability.
   In the second half of 1991, Midland reported a trading
profit before bad debts of #468 million, down slightly from
#480 million in the first half. Trading profit for the full
year, at #948 million, was up 27.6% from 1990 levels.
   Midland's United Kingdom banking operations still showed a
pretax loss of #168 million in 1991, compared with a loss of
#68 million in 1990 despite a 46% improvement in trading
profits before bad debts.
