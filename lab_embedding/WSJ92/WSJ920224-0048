Business Brief -- System Industries Inc.:
   Firm Posts Widened Loss
   For Fiscal Second Quarter
The company said the results reflected a weaker dollar and
one-time expenses for a legal settlement and other matters.
   Company officials were hopeful for a major resurgence in
revenue in future quarters as a subcontractor to Boeing Co.'s
$1.6 billion contract with the Army to provide a huge
computer system. System anticipates it could sell Boeing as
much as $140 million in disks and tape drives for that
contract over the next three years.
   System's earnings were announced after the close of
financial markets Friday. Its stock fell to 12.5 cents to
$3.50 in American Stock Exchange trading.
   For its fiscal six months, the company said its loss
widened to $4.7 million, or 84 cents a share, from $510,000,
or 10 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales fell
33% to $33.3 million from $49.5 million.
