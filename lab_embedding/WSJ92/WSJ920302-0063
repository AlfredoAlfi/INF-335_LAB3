Delta, Continental Back
   `Excursion' Fare Increase
But the fate of the proposed increases apparently hinges
on what will be done by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, one of
the nation's most powerful air carriers. American has not yet
responded to United's initial bid to raise fares by 2% across
the board.
   Delta, a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc., and Continental, a
unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., said they would
raise the price only on so-called "excursion" fares, the
cheap tickets used mainly by leisure travelers.
   USAir Group Inc.'s USAir, NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines
and Alaska Airlines, a unit of Alaska Air Group Inc., have
said they will go along with United and raise all fares.
   But if Delta and Continental go along only on the
excursion fares, the other carriers will probably have to
back off on raising the price of fully refundable regular
fares, which are used mostly by business travelers.
   Still, United, which plans to put the increase into effect
this Friday, wouldn't say whether the stance taken by Delta
and Continental would force it to retreat from raising the
full-price fares.
   American said it was still studying the fare increase.
