Business Brief:
   United Technologies
   To Announce Today
   Details of Revamping
The company previously said that it would take a charge
related to the restructuring plan in the 1991 fourth quarter,
and that the move would result in a loss for the quarter as
well as the full year. Wall Street analysts, some of whom had
expected the company to post a profit at around $2.50 a share
before the restructuring announcement, now expect United
Technologies to post a loss of several hundred million
dollars. It would be the second time that United Technologies
will have posted a full-year loss in its history; the last
time the company had a full-year loss, which was $43 million,
was in 1971.
   The company said it will make the announcement at 8 a.m.
EST and follow it up with a detailed presentation to analysts
in New York.
   United Technologies has posted sharply lower earnings in
recent quarters because of a continued weakness in automotive
and building markets. The company also has been hit hard by
the shrinking U.S. defense budget. In 1990, the company
earned $750.6 million, or $5.91 a share, on revenue of $21.78
billion.
