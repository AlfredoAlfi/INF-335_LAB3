Pact Is Signed to Launch
   A Latin American Fund
Money in the Multilateral Assistance Fund will be used to
help enact policies aimed at improving the trade environment;
for human resource support, including retraining of displaced
workers; and for financial and technical support for small
business development. The fund will be administered by the
Inter-American Development Bank over five years.
   Although adminstration officials said they were confident
Congress would appropriate the funds to make good on the U.S.
pledge, legislation authorizing the creation of the fund has
been pending in Congress for about a year. Japan has also
pledged a $500 million contribution. Spain, Germany, France,
Italy, Portugal, Canada and 13 Latin American countries have
together pledged $300 million for the fund, for total pledges
of $1.3 billion to date.
