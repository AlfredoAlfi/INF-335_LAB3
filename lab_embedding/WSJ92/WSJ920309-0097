Business Brief -- Morrison Knudsen Corp.:
   Order That Could Generate
   Over $140 Million Advances
Separately, Morrison Knudsen said a company-sponsored
joint venture was the apparent low bidder for a $50 million
contract to build a waste-water outlet off Point Loma in San
Diego. The company, which has transportation, power,
industrial process and environmental interests, has been
repairing a ruptured outfall in the region under a separate
