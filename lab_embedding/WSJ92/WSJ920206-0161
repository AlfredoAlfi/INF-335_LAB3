Technology Brief:
   Acuson Says Growth
   Will Slow This Period;
   Stock Plunges 26%
Analysts had until yesterday projected first-quarter
profit of about 44 cents a share.
   The company's stock was quoted in late New York Stock
Exchange trading, at $22.875, down $8.
   In April 1991, the stock reached a peak of $40.
   Recession and cost containment pressures in the
health-care industry have turned Acuson's customers,
including hospitals and physicians, into cautious consumers
of its costly equipment, said Robert Gallagher, chief
financial officer. The company's ultrasound products cost
between $100,000 and $200,000, he said.
   "It's not like the bloom is off the rose," Mr. Gallagher
said. "Demand for new equipment is sluggish, but we see this
as temporary and we can't predict when it's going to change."
   Sales are expected grow between 10% and 15% this year,
versus 19% in 1991, Mr. Gallagher said. Rather than scaling
back, the company plans to increase its sales staff and spend
more to develop new products, expenditures that will
proportionately outstrip sales growth.
   For the fourth-quarter, the company said it earned $15.5
million, or 42 cents a share, against $12.9 million, or 36
cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 19% to $89.9 million
from $75.6 million.
   For the year, net was $58.5 million, or $1.59 a share, up
22% from $47.8 million, or $1.33 a share. Sales jumped 19% to
$336.3 million from $282.8 million.
