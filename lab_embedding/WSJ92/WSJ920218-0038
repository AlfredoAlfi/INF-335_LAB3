Business Brief -- Liposome Co.:
   Firm Posts 4th-Quarter Loss
   Against Year-Ago Profit
The fourth-quarter loss, equal to five cents a share,
compares with earnings of $544,000, or four cents a share,
the year before. Anne Van Lent, chief financial officer, said
the amount was in line with losses posted by the company in
most quarters. She said the profit in the 1990 quarter was
helped by $2.5 million in one-time licensing fees.
   The company, which develops liposome-based and lipid-based
pharmaceuticals, had $2.6 million in revenue, the bulk of
which came from collaborative research and development
revenue. In the 1990 quarter, revenue was $4.1 million.
   For the year, Liposome's losses narrowed to $4.1 million,
or 22 cents a share, from $5 million, or 35 cents a share.
   Liposome said it plans to use proceeds from the share
offering for product development and clinical testing.
