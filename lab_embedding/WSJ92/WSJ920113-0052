   Profit in Fiscal 2nd Quarter

The energy industry environmental services concern said
second-quarter results will include a pretax charge of

employees.
   The company didn't estimate revenue, which was $4.1
million in the first quarter. But the company did say
second-quarter revenue was reduced about $2 million because
of delays in certain customers' projects.
