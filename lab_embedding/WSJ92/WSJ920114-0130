Mitsubishi Aide Says Woes
   Of Big Three Are Home-Grown
The comments by Mr. Recchia are among the first response
from a Japanese auto maker to heated rhetoric from Big Three
executives, particularly Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca. Following his trip to Japan with President Bush, Mr.
Iacocca said the U.S. should demand a solution to the trade
imbalance with Japan and retaliate if one isn't forthcoming.
   But Mr. Recchia said the Big Three auto makers have only
themselves to blame since they failed to cap prices when
imported vehicles' prices rose in the 1980s. He also said the
Big Three should have devoted their huge profits in the 1980s
to products instead of the nonautomotive businesses each
company bought.
