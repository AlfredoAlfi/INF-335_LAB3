Marketing  Media:
   Five at News Corp.'s
   Coupon-Insert Unit
   Move to New Rival
Mr. Moschetti had been executive vice president of Quad
Marketing, one of two FSI companies owned by News Corp. FSIs
are special inserts for Sunday newspapers that carry coupons
from major packaged-goods companies.
   The defections probably will heighten competition in an
industry dominated by two players, both of them
Australian-owned. News Corp., based in Sydney, has 50% of the
market with Quad and another company, Product Movers. The
other 50% of the market belongs to Valassis Inserts, a
Detroit company owned by Australian Kerry Packer's
Consolidated Press Ltd.
   The FSI division is one of News Corp.'s most dependably
profitable, with more than $100 million in operating profit
on sales of $600 million in 1991, insiders said.
   Sullivan Graphics was formed in 1989 in a leveraged
buy-out by former R.R. Donnelley executive James Sullivan. It
is the largest printer of Sunday comics, distributing to more
than 400 newspapers nation-wide. Sullivan already distributes
a combination comics/FSI insert for papers called National
PreSerts. That will become the core of the new FSI company
Mr. Moschetti is starting.
