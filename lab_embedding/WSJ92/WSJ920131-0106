Letters to the Editor:
   Better-Performing,
   Custom-Fit Diapers
Gerber correctly viewed the future as not being centered
around the same flat cotton diaper it has been making for the
past 40 years. Today's consumer demands a better-performing,
detailed, custom-fit diaper. Consumers' environmental
concerns have not diminished, but busy life styles demand
convenience. This reality demands that the reusable-diaper
industry respond with product innovation, concept updates and
consistent technology improvements.
   Gerber's Pelzer weaving plant represented a tremendously
high overhead, which decreased its ability to effect the
change necessary to keep pace with the market and be
competitively priced. Instead of complaining that life is not
fair, it has streamlined its operation. By jettisoning the
weaving operation, Gerber is free to buy woven cloth from all
markets and concentrate on producing a finished product that
will sell to today's environmentally conscious consumer.
