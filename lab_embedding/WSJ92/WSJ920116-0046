International Brief -- Regent International Hotels Ltd.:
   EIE Acts to Acquire Stake
   Owned by Robert H. Burns
Last year, Hong Kong-based Wharf won an auction conducted
by Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. to find a buyer for Mr. Burns's
shares in Regent, a Hong Kong-based luxury hotel firm. In
October, Wharf and Mr. Burns entered a conditional agreement,
with Wharf reportedly offering to pay the Regent co-founder
US$95 million. But EIE, which holds 30% of Regent and is a
major owner of the chain's properties, had three months to
exercise its right of first refusal on Mr. Burns's shares.
The deadline was Wednesday.
   EIE executives were unavailable for comment, as Wednesday
was a public holiday in Japan. Officials at the company's
Hong Kong office referred questions to a public-relations
firm, which said it didn't have any information on the
subject.
