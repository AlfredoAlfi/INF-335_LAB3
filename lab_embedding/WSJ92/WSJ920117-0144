Letters to the Editor:
   Relief From Command
   Is Dire Punishment
Finally, to state, as the Army spokesman does, that one
cannot compare similar cases in different combat divisions
implies that military justice has fallen prey to baronial
feudalism. Happily, that isn't so, and the Army should be
doubly ashamed for using such a lame excuse to cover up a
blatant scapegoating.
