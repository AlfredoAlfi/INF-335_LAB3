Technology Brief -- Boeing Co.:
   Firm Decides Not to Build
   New Wind-Tunnel Complex
Boeing said in Seattle that it determined that its future
wind tunnel requirements could be met through use of the
company's current facilities and by leasing space in other
wind tunnels world-wide. A spokesman said the decision was
made on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis.
   Last October the aerospace concern announced it had
selected five locations for further investigation as sites
for a proposed new wind-tunnel complex. Those locations were
Hanging Rock, Ohio; Lawrence, Kan.; Oak Ridge, Tenn.;
Portage, Ind., and Rathdrum, Idaho.
   Boeing said it will continue to operate its wind tunnels
at two locations -- near Seattle and in Philadelphia.
