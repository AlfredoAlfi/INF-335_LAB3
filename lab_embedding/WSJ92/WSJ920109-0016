Business Brief -- Best Buy Co.:
   Same-Store Sales Rose 16%
   In December; Stock Soars
The Minneapolis-based consumer electronics and major
appliance retailer said it experienced a "strong surge" in
business beginning on Dec. 21. Best Buy said overall sales
for December rose 48% to $187 million from $126 million a
year earlier.
   On Dec. 19, when the company announced the earlier erosion
of sales, its shares tumbled $7.25 on expectations that the
trend would hurt fourth-quarter earnings. December sales
represent 80% to 100% of fourth-quarter profit.
   At the time, Best Buy also said weakening economic
conditions had required price-cutting, which put greater
pressure on margins. A spokesman said yesterday the increase
in sales "partially offsets" the pressure on margins, but
wouldn't elaborate on the outlook for the quarter.
