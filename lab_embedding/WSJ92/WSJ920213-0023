Business Brief -- Manville Corp.:
   Quarterly Loss to Be Posted
   Due to Accounting Change
The fourth-quarter loss includes a pretax charge of about
$28 million for restructuring and the impact of the
retirementpackage charge. Sales for the quarter fell 9.4% to
$506 million from $559 million for the year-earlier quarter.
   The Denver building products and paperboard container
company expects to post 1991 income of about $75.7 million,
down about 67% from $232.4 million in 1990. Sales slipped to
$2 billion from $2.1 billion in 1990.
   Separately, Manville confirmed that it was the subject of
a recent Internal Revenue Service ruling that concluded that
major legal, accounting and consulting costs incurred during
a Chapter 11 proceeding aren't deductible unless they stem
solely from the handling of the company's liability claims.
Manville emphasized that the ruling wouldn't have any
material effect on its financial position.
