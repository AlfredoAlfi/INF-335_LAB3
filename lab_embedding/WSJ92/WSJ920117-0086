Mexico Lifts Ban on U.S. Hogs
The disease causes anorexia, respiratory distress and
reproductive problems and is believed to be transmitted by
contact between animals, agriculture officials said.
   The agreement to end Mexico's import ban on hogs for
slaughter and breeding was reached in Miami between U.S. and
Mexican animal health officials.
   Last month, Mexico had also banned imports of certain U.S.
fruits because of concern about the spread of the Oriental
fruit moth. But U.S. Rep. E. (Kika) De la Garza (D., Texas)
said that ban has been lifted while certification procedures
are negotiated.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Edward Madigan said the
agreement on hogs will allow exports to resume next week.
U.S. farmers exported more than 195,000 hogs to Mexico in
1991.
