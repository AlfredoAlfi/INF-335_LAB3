Credit Ratings
STATE STREET BOSTON Corp. (Boston) -- IBCA Ltd. raised the
long-term rating for the bank holding company to double-A
from double-A-minus. It also raised the long-term deposit
rating of the principal bank unit, State Street Bank  Trust
Co., to double-A-plus from double-A. The rating agency said
the holding company largely has escaped the real
estate-related problems suffered by its regional competitors.
About two-thirds of State Street's net revenue is derived
from trust and processing services and other fiduciary
services. IBCA said State Street's dominant position in
fiduciary services "will ensure above-average profitability
and internal capital generation."
