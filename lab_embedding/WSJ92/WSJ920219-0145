Who's News:
   CompuAdd's Thomas
   Resigns as President,
   Chief of Operations
Mr. Thomas, 53 years old, joined CompuAdd four years ago
after 27 years with International Business Machines Corp. He
was named president and chief operating officer in August
1989. Bill Hayden, the founder and sole owner of CompuAdd,
remains chief executive officer.
   Closely held CompuAdd received widespread attention
recently after winning big contracts from the U.S. Air Force
and from Sears, Roebuck  Co. The Air Force award, which the
company shared with Sysorex Information Systems Inc., has a
potential value of $1 billion. After protests from other
bidders, however, the contract was canceled and another round
of bidding ordered.
