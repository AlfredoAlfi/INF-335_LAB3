International Brief -- Scandinavian Airlines System:
   Budget Fare, New Services
   Unveiled to Attract Fliers
SAS said it is introducing sleeper seats on
intercontinental routes for a $300 surcharge. SAS said these
are the first business-class sleeper seats in the airline
business.
   SAS also said it will upgrade its general in-flight
services on European and intercontinental flights by offering
newspapers, beer and wine free of charge. It will also add
telephone check-in and various types of automated check-in
choices.
   For the non-business traveler, SAS said it will launch on
Feb. 3 a low-fare ticket, called Jackpot, that will cost an
average of 25% to 30% less than the cheapest ticket now
available, the Apex or advance-purchase excursion ticket.
   The new fare will cover a limited number of seats on each
flight and will eventually be available on almost all
flights, SAS said. Jackpot ticket holders also will be given
bargain prices at SAS hotels in Europe.
