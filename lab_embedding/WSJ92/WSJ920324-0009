Martin Marietta, Lockheed
   Prepare Responses to FTC
The inquiries appear to reflect concern over competition
between Lockheed of Calabasas, Calif., Martin Marietta and
Vought Corp., as Lockheed and Martin Marietta have proposed
to name the jointly owned company through which they would
operate the LTV aircraft and missile businesses. Dallas-based
LTV has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
protection since 1986.
   Martin Marietta said it didn't expect the latest FTC query
to delay the proposed acquisition. "We did our homework
carefully before the offer," the spokesman said. Lockheed and
Martin Marietta signed a definitive agreement with LTV late
last month to buy its aircraft and missile units, but the two
companies are expecting a challenging bid by Carlyle Group, a
Washington, D.C., group of investors, and Thomson CSF, a
French electronics concern.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the company considers the FTC's
"treatment of the matter serious but routine." He said LTV is
bidding against Lockheed on several programs, but that
Lockheed "would expect there would be competitive activities"
after any acquisition.
