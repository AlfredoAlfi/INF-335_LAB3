Letters to the Editor:
   Patients' Charts
   Kept Confidential
What is contained in the PCN computer is merely the same
diagnosis and procedure codes that are required by all
third-party payers including the government. There is nothing
in the PCN system that isn't already on a patient's
insurance-claim form.
   If we are truly concerned about confidentiality, we should
address government intrusion in our health care.
