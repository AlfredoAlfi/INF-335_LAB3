Economic Incentives Urged
   To Fight California Smog
Companies would be able to join together to achieve
mandated emissions reductions, and firms that exceed their
annual goals would be issued credits that they could sell.
   "Trading of emissions credits will provide firms with an
incentive to develop innovative pollution controls," said
James M. Lents, a top AQMD official. The agency's board of
directors will hold an initial public hearing on the plan
March 5. While the broad outline is in place, Mr. Lents said
AQMD would work with businesses, unions and environmental
groups to refine the specifics of the plan.
