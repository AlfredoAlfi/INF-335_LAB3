Business Brief -- Enstar Group Inc.:
   Firm Says Court Approved
   Chapter 11 Reorganization
Enstar said creditors have claims against the company of
about $200 million. Although more than $100 million of those
claims are "partially secured, contingent, or disputed," the
company said in a statement, Enstar added that it doesn't
expect to have sufficient assets to satisfy the allowed
claims.
   Accordingly, the company said its plan contains no
provision for payment to stockholders and calls for the
cancellation of all common stock.
