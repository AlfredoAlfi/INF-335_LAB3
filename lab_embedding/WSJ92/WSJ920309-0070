Credit Ratings:
   Canada's Dominion
   Reaffirms Ratings
   Of Olympia  York
Dominion said it received numerous inquiries last week
about Olympia's creditworthiness in the wake of rumors that
the conglomerate, which is believed to have about $20 billion
in debt, was having difficulty repaying some of its loans.
The rumors, which rocked financial markets, were
categorically denied by Olympia, a closely held concern of
Toronto's Reichmann family.
   "All of {Olympia's public debt} programs have specific
collateral pledged," Dominion said. "In our February review,
the adequacy of this collateral and Olympia  York's
compliance with all terms was confirmed."
