Business Brief -- Komag Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Profit Fell
   As Sales Increased Sharply
But the company said the decline in earnings resulted from
extraordinary charges related to its acquisition in December
of Dastek Inc., a maker of thinfilm heads used in hard-disk
drives. Komag said it earned $6.5 million on its own
operations, but took a one-time charge of $2.1 million in
connection with the purchase of Dastek, which had a loss of
$3.5 million on its operations for the quarter.
   For 1991, Komag posted net of $15.1 million, or 74 cents a
share, on revenue of $279.2 million, compared with net of
$12.9 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of $179.9
million in 1990.
   Komag said its 1991 results included write-offs of $8.4
million at Dastek, primarily for the establishment of
reserves against inventories and accounts receivable.
