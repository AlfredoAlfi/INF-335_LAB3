Cleveland Official to Vote
   At Fed's February Meeting
Custom has been for the president of the other bank, in
this case Chicago, to take the voting seat in these
circumstances. But the Cleveland Fed, which has been more
assertive about its prerogatives than some other district
banks, was reluctant to go along with that. The boards of the
Chicago and Cleveland Fed banks agreed to give Mr. Hendricks
the vote.
   By law, the presidents of five of the 12 district Fed
banks -- or their representatives -- join the seven Fed
governors in Washington in voting on monetary policy.
   Mr. Hendricks, 59 years old, has been with the Cleveland
Fed since 1958 and has been in his current post since 1982.
His views on monetary policy aren't well-known.
