Banks Aren't Tightening
   Loan Standards, Fed Finds
The majority of banks surveyed reported stronger
residential mortgage demand, while demand for home equity
loans was split about evenly.
   The survey also said that consumer-installment loan demand
continued to weaken between October and January, even though
banks' willingness to provide consumer loans "increased a
bit" during the same period.
