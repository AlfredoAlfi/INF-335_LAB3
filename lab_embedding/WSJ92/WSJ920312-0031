International Brief -- Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB:
   Pulp, Paper Firm Has Loss;
   Chairman to Resign in May
Stora also said its chairman, Peter Wallenberg, will step
down at the annual meeting in May. The current chief
executive, Bo Berggren, was tapped as successor. Deputy
Chairman Peder Bonde also will resign but his board seat
probably won't be filled immediately, the company said.
   Stora's boardroom succession is the clearest sign yet of a
continuing shuffle of senior positions within the
family-controlled Wallenberg empire. It marks the first major
chairmanship relinquished by Mr. Wallenberg, the 65-year-old
family scion who had heart surgery in 1991.
