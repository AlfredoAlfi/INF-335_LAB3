   Hollinger Bid for Maariv
Yehuda Levy, Hollinger's Israel representative, said
Maariv, if acquired by Hollinger, would stand among its top
10 publications, which include the Daily Telegraph in London.
Maariv also would be its second holding in Israel.
   The administrators will sell Maariv but are not dealing
with other Maxwell holdings in the country -- 51% of Keter
Publishing and 17% of Teva Pharmaceuticals.
