U.S. Bioscience Corp.
   Holders File Charges
   Of Misinformation
U.S. Bioscience shares lost nearly half their value Monday
in heavy trading, following a late Friday decision by the
Food and Drug Administration panel not to approve Ethyol. The
panel said the drug showed much promise, but that sufficient
data hadn't been gathered to support its indicated use. Most
analysts who have followed the biotechnology company expected
a more favorable decision.
   The West Conshohockon, Pa., company's shares had traded
several weeks ago as high as $44, after a 2-for-1 split in
December; they closed yesterday at $19.25, up $1.50, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   H. Robert Fiebach, an outside attorney for U.S.
Bioscience, said he had reviewed one of the suits so far, but
was confident that the cases "will be dismissed early on" in
the process. "The investing public knew about the FDA
approval process, and the risk of being in this business"
which depends on FDA review, Mr. Fiebach said. "FDA approval
isn't automatic."
   Attorneys for several of the plaintiffs couldn't be
reached for comment.
