Technology:
   Control Data to Sell
   NEC Supercomputers
   In North America
The companies also said they will explore jointly
developing and marketing workstations and file servers based
on the Unix operating system for sale in both the U.S. and
Japan.
   Control Data, a computer services concern, said it will
market NEC's SX-3 supercomputers primarily to the automotive
and aerospace industries, though it also hopes to break into
the civilian government business, which traditionally has
been sensitive about purchasing a Japanese-made computer.
But, said James E. Ousley, president of the computer products
group, "sooner or later, they're going to have to take
advantage of technology from other places in the world."
   Control Data will provide support for the machines, which
start at $5 million each. The typical system costs $15
million to $25 million.
   Control Data said the NEC agreement won't affect its
marketing agreements with Cray and Convex Computer Corp., a
maker of smaller supercomputers. Mr. Ousley said Control Data
includes Cray and Convex machines as part of its bids for
total computer systems and adding NEC to the line would
"allow us to be more competitive."
