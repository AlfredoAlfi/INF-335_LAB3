Business Brief -- Stratus Computer Inc.:
   Rise in Net Income of 30%
   Posted for Fourth Quarter
In the year-ago quarter, net income was $13.5 million, or
64 cents a share on fewer shares, on revenue of $118.5
million.
   Sales through a resale agreement with International
Business Machines Corp. continued to fall, dropping 16%

offsetting the sales decline through IBM.
   Sales in new telecommunications markets soared during the
year, Stratus said, to more than 20% of total revenue, while
the banking industry continues to be a strong growth market.
Sales in banking jumped 48% in the year to about 24% of total
revenue, Stratus said.
   For the year, net income rose 34% to $49.7 million, or
$2.22 a share, on an 11% revenue increase to $448.6 million.
Net income last year was $37 million, or $1.77 a share, on
revenue of $403.9 million.
