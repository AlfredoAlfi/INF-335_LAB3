Northwest Air Backs Plan
   For 2% Increase in Fares
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines last week proposed to raise
domestic fares 2%, starting March 3. So far, USAir Group Inc.
and Alaska Airlines have been the only carriers to match the
action. Northwest is a unit of NWA Inc., which is a unit of
Wings Holdings Inc.
   Other airlines, such as AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and America West
Airlines, have said they're studying United's move. Trans
World Airlines has indicated it doesn't plan to raise fares.
   The fare increase could go through without TWA or America
West because their domestic route networks are smaller than
that of the country's big carriers. But a fare increase
usually doesn't go into effect unless all major carriers,
such as American and Delta, agree to it.
