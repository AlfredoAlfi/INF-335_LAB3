Who's News:
   Govpx Inc. Picks Jones
   To Be Chief Executive
Govpx, which provides real-time price quotes, is a
cooperative venture of all the primary dealers in U.S.
Treasury securities, and is one of several new ventures in
the increasingly competitive market for bond-price
information. The Govpx service was launched after years of
government pressure to expand public access to U.S.
government securities prices.
   Separately, Govpx said it is developing a digital
transmission for Treasury prices that can be used in forming
charts and analytical tools. It expects to have the pricing
transmission ready later this year.
