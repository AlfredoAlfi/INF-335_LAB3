   Medical IRA Proposal
   Good, but Needs Work
Second, consumers will need full and plain disclosure of
outcomes research before they can compare quality and
effectiveness as well as price. Significant funding of
outcomes research and development of a disclosure methodology
are the most important and cost-effective steps the federal
government could take to face down our medical-care system's
problems in the 1990s. If even half of the estimated 25% of
unnecessary costs of medical care can be saved as a result of
outcomes research, we can divert the saved professional time
and resources to provide first-class care for the uninsured
and underinsured. As Mr. Rooney says, "Wouldn't that be
great?"
