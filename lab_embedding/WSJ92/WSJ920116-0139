Letters to the Editor:
   You Ignore Turkey's
   Political Realities
There are many more than 12 million Kurds in Turkey. They
are, and have been, continuously persecuted. Recently,
Turkish planes attacked refugee camps outside the Turkish
border, murdering innocent Kurds. The Kurds are part of an
ancient nation that deserves independence.
   Your article ignores the Cyprus question. Turkey is in
violation of the same United Nations resolutions that were
violated by Saddam Hussein. The Cyprus Turkish state is
recognized by only one country in the world -- Turkey. There
cannot be any peace in the region unless Turkish troops leave
the island.
   Turkey is an isolated country that lost its geopolitical
importance with the demise of communism. Eventually and
inevitably, it will break up; Kurdish independence will be
recognized and the just territorial claims of Turkey's
surrounding neighbors will be realized.
   To present Turkey any other way, as you are trying to do,
is parroting Turkish Foreign Ministry propaganda.
