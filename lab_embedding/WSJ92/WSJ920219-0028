Business Brief -- Prime Motor Inns Inc.:
   Revised Reorganization Plan
   Advanced by Court Action
Prime Motor, which is based in Fairfield, N.J., and has
been in Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Miami since September 1990, said the second reorganization
plan resulted from continuing talks with creditors after the
original plan had been filed. The hearing on the plan's
confirmation is expected on April 2, and the hotel concern
may emerge from bankruptcy-court proceedings as early as 90
days later.
   Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company
continues to operate but has court protection against
creditors' lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan for
paying its debts.
