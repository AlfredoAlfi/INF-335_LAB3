Westmark Net Rose
   In Fourth Quarter;
   Stock Plan Is Slated
The proposal would allow each part of the company to
concentrate on its own business, Westmark said. Spacelabs
makes electronic patient monitoring systems. Advanced
Technology Laboratories, Westmark's other major division,
makes diagnostic ultrasound equipment.
   If the plan is approved by shareholders, the distribution
of stock would be completed by the end of the second quarter,
Westmark said.
   For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 27, Westmark posted net
income of $10 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of
$144.6 million, compared with year-earlier net of $3.7
million, or 39 cents a share, on revenue of $122 million. The
most recent quarter included a gain of $1.1 million, or 10
cents a share, from a tax-loss carry-forward.
   For the year, Westmark posted a 22% increase in net income
to $22.9 million, or $2.24 a share, on revenue of $504.7
million. The year-end results include an extraordinary credit
of $1.5 million, or 15 cents a share. In the previous year,
Westmark earned $18.7 million, or $1.83 a share, on revenue
of $485 million. Those results include an extraordinary
credit of $2.3 million, or 22 cents a share.

the over-the-counter market.
