International:
   Five Courts Set Up
   To Process the Claims
   From Bhopal Disaster
Union Carbide Corp. agreed in 1989 to pay $470 million in
compensation to the government to disburse to victims and
their relatives, but the payments were blocked by appeals for
the right of victims to reach their own settlement with the
U.S. company.
   The Indian Supreme Court on Oct. 3 last year withdrew
criminal immunity granted to Union Carbide under the 1989
agreement, but the five-judge panel upheld the $470 million
settlement, clearing the way for distributing financial
compensation.
   More than 639,000 people have filed injury claims,
Director of Claims L.U. Siddiqui said. Three weeks will be
given to the claimants to justify their demands. The
compensation will vary from person to person. The $470
million, deposited by Union Carbide with the Indian
government shortly after the 1989 settlement, has been
accruing interest of $78,000 every day.
