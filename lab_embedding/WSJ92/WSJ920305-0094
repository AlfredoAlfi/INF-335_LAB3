International:
   German Wholesale Prices Drop
That follows a real 1% decline in December and a real 4%
decline in November and provides a further indication that
Germany's economy is coming back to earth after a
unification-related boom.
   Real changes are based on 1985 prices.
   The statistics office said wholesale sales of raw
materials and half-finished goods fell a real 3% to 28
billion marks.
