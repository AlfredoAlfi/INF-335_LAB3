Federal Express Unit,
   Laura Ashley Form
   Distribution Alliance
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The alliance is intended to be indefinite, the companies
said, but has a contract period of 10 years. During this
period, Laura Ashley estimates the value of the contract to
Business Logistics at about #150 million ($259.1 million).
   The companies said Laura Ashley will save money on the
simplification of the existing supply chain amounting to 10%
to 12% of total distribution costs, as well as substantial
reductions in working capital. The company also will have
access to Federal Express's global systems. At a minimum this
will save Laura Ashley #3 million in planned systems
development costs, the companies said.
   They said they also will establish joint operating and
systems teams to improve the operation of Laura Ashley's
global logistics function.
   Business Logistics will continue to operate Laura Ashley's
existing distribution center at Newtown in Mid Wales, and
Laura Ashley will close its other distribution centers, the
companies said.
