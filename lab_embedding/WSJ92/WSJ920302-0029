Business Brief -- Panhandle Eastern Corp.:
   Units Seek to Recover Costs
   From a Natural Gas Project
The third unit, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co., which is
also a customer of Trunkline, filed with the FERC asking to
flow through its allocated costs from the two Trunkline
filings. Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line asked for recovery of
$151 million related to the liquefied natural gas minimum
bill and $51 million related to take-or-pay costs.
   Under take-or-pay contracts utilities agree to pay for
amounts of gas regardless of their ability to accept
delivery.
