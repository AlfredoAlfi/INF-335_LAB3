Bail Set at $600,000
   For Financier Wymer
   In Missing-Funds Case
The youthful-looking 43-year-old Newport Beach, Calif.,
financier seemed confident and relaxed, frequently jotting
notes during the hearing to his team of four attorneys and
grinning at his daughter and wife in the gallery.
   While serving as president and sole shareholder of
Institutional Treasury Management Inc., based in Irvine,
Calif., and its predecessor, Denman  Co., Mr. Wymer
reportedly attracted some $1.2 billion in funds from cities
and other government units. Prosecutors say $113 million of
that money is missing.
   "This is money that was put in to client accounts and that
he took out personally, and it has disappeared," Assistant
U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said at the hearing.
   Mr. Wymer allegedly gave clients phony reports of
transactions made in their behalf. Prosecutors say they have
discovered nearly 1,500 fraudulent trade confirmations dating
to 1988 and evidence of an "illegal scheme" that began in
1986about the same time Mr. Wymer began working at Denman.
Mr. Asperger said that 69 of the firms' 105 institutional
clients received fake documents.
   Attorneys for Mr. Wymer have maintained that the absence
of the funds is due to trading losses and that their client
isn't guilty of any wrongdoing.
