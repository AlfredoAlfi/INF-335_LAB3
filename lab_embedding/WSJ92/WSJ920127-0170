Business Brief:
   U S West Posts Loss
   For Quarter, Year;
   Restructuring Cited
Overall, the company said it saw some positive signs that
the economy in its 14-state region is beginning to pull out
of the recession. The number of customer telephone lines rose
3% to 12.9 million at the end of the year; calling volumes
were also up significantly.
   The charges in the quarter stem from the company's
previously announced plan to cut its work force by 6,000,
projected losses associated with withdrawing from the real
estate business, and the write-off of certain intangible
assets. The Oregon regulatory plan includes retroactive
customer refunds, but gives the company greater flexibility
to price its services.
   The charges also sharply depressed 1991 earnings. U S
West's net for the year dropped nearly 54% to $553.4 million,
or $1.38 a share, from $1.2 billion, or $3.11 a share, in
1990. Revenue, again boosted by $400 million in real estate
sales, climbed to $10.6 billion from $9.96 billion.
