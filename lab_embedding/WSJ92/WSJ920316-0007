Environment Groups Settle
   Suit Over Boston Freeway
State transportation officials said earlier that they
supported traffic-cutting measures, and included some in
their plans, but didn't have the funds or authority to
guarantee the costly package sought by the foundation.
   Under terms of the settlement, filed in federal court,
state transportation agencies committed to implement major
extensions of commuter rail and subway lines, new
park-and-ride spaces at transit stations, bus and car-pool
lanes on interstate routes and other such measures. The
measures had been promised verbally before the lawsuit was
filed.
