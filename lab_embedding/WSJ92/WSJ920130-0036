Business Brief -- Hibernia Corp.:
   Banking Concern Posts Loss
   In Net for Fourth Quarter
Hibernia said the charges included write-downs of branch
and banking facilities, severance costs and write-downs of
its Texas unit and discontinued business lines. The quarter
also included a $32.5 million addition to loan-loss reserves,
compared with a $57.4 million addition in the yearago period,
and a $15 million gain from securities sales.
   In an effort to bring it in compliance with regulatory
requirements, Hibernia said it will try to reduce its assets
to less than $5 billion through asset sales, including the
sale of its Texas unit. Assets were $5.82 billion at year
end, down from $7.36 billion at the end of 1990.
   The company's nonperforming assets were $319 million at
year end, down from their peak, but above the year-ago level
of $215 million. Its commercial real-estate portfolio shrank
to $542 million from $739 million at the end of 1990, it
said.
