Credit Ratings
MASSACHUSETTS MUNICIPAL WHOLESALE ELECTRIC Co., Ludlow,
Mass., had its power-supply revenue bonds upgraded by Moody's
Investors Service Inc. to a rating of Baa-1 from Baa, which
had been suspended because of litigation, the rating agency
said. The action follows the U.S. Supreme Court refusal
earlier this month to hear an appeal of a ruling that
Massachusetts municipal utilities must honor power contracts
related to the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear plant, because the
petition was filed too late. The decision frees Massachusetts
Municipal, a consortium of municipal utilities, to refund its
high-interest bonds at more favorable interest rates. The
upgrade covers $1.35 billion of debt.
