   NBC Declines to Renew
   Revamped `Golden Girls'
Late yesterday, NBC reached an agreement with Walt Disney
Co., the studio that produces "Golden Girls," to renew
another hit series, "Empty Nest." The network ordered two
years of episodes of the show. Both comedies are responsible
for NBC's huge ratings dominance on Saturday nights.
Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions, the producers of the
seven-year-old "Golden Girls," wanted NBC to commit to 22
episodes of "Golden Palace," but the General Electric Co.
unit wanted to order only 13 episodes, according to NBC
officials.
   "Golden Girls" needed to be reworked because one of the
four co-stars, Bea Arthur, is leaving the show. The show was
moved to 8 p.m. last September from 9 p.m. and its ratings
plunged 19%. This year, the program is watched by 13.3% of
U.S. homes with televisions compared with 16.5% last year.
   The ratings for the four-year-old "Empty Nest" have also
fared poorly this year, falling to 14.5% from 16.9%.
   NBC, which will finish the 1991-92 season as the No. 2
prime-time network -- behind CBS -- after six years as No. 1,
is canceling shows that it feels appeal to older viewers,
those less desirable to advertisers.
