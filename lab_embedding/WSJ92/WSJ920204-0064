International Brief -- Wace Group:
   Chief Resigns; Firm Denies
   Irish Republican Army Link
On Friday, before the announcement, Wace stock dropped 64
pence a share to 104 pence in trading on the London Stock
Exchange. It rose yesterday to 125 pence.
   The resignation came a week after a report in London's
Sunday Telegraph that claimed the IRA had been using a London
firm to launder millions of dollars through London's stock
exchange. The paper didn't identify Wace, but the name later
came up in stock exchange rumors.
   British and Irish authorities declined to comment on
whether there is an ongoing investigation. The Telegraph
report was contradicted by a subsequent report by London's
Financial Times. The newspaper said that while Northern
Ireland's Royal Ulster Constabulary had investigated links
between Mr. Clegg and the IRA, it had found no evidence and
had dropped the inquiry and that Britain's Serious Fraud
Office also declined to pursue the matter.
