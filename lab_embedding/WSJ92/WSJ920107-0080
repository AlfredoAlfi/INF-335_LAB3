Business Brief -- Du Pont Co.:
   Big 1993 Charge Is Slated
   On Change in Accounting
The accounting charges -- which won't affect the company's
cash flow -- are to cover Du Pont's adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 106. SFAS 106, which all U.S.
companies are required to adopt, requires employers to set up
a reserve for post-retirement health benefits, and companies
have to take a big "catchup" charge when they make the
switch.
   Du Pont stock was quoted at $45.50 a share, down 75 cents,
in late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
