Business Brief -- Nonno Co.:
   Seoul Exchange Extends
   Apparel Maker's Suspension
The trading suspension followed persistent rumors that the
company is in such financial trouble that its creditor banks
are considering cutting off assistance and forcing the
company to be placed under court receivership.
   Nonno executives weren't available for comment. A company
official said the executives were meeting with bank officials
in an effort to obtain more loans. But bank officials said
they have yet to reach a decision about what to do with the
company.
   Under South Korean law, banks can place their own managers
in charge of a company that is no longer able to keep up with
loan payments. But if creditors elect to withhold any further
assistance, the company can ask to be placed under court
receivership.
