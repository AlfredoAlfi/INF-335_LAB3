Business Brief -- Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.:
   Settlement Set of Lawsuit
   Filed by Warner-Lambert
Last August, Bolar, based in Copiague, N.Y., settled for
$40 million a lawsuit filed by SmithKline Beecham PLC over
Bolar's generic version of SmithKline's Dyazide, a
blood-pressure medicine. A month before that, it settled a
class-action suit for $3.8 million filed by buyers of its
generic version of Dyazide and a second drug.
   Bolar also agreed last year to pay a $10 million fine and
pleaded guilty to federal charges of mislabeling and
adulterating some generic drugs. The Warner-Lambert
settlement is to be paid in installments by Jan. 1, 1997.
