California Governor Offers
   Budget Without Tax Boosts
The governor also proposed to raise spending for education
by $1.8 billion, or 8%, and to fund basic health-care
services for low-income children. But the budget also hits
college students with tuition increases of as much as 40%.
   He said the moves would eliminate an estimated $2 billion
deficit that is expected at the end of the current fiscal
year, as well as a spending shortfall of as much as $6
billion during the next 18 months. He added, however, that
state revenue continues to fall short of forecasts. "The fact
is, we are now projecting a mid-year start to a slow
recovery, but the actual recovery date continues to be a
moving target," the governor said.
   The proposed budget met with immediate criticism. Assembly
Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., a Democrat, labeled it too
optimistic. Gov. Wilson "assumes a Herbert Hoover view of the
economy because he has decided to be more optimistic about
the economy than most economists," Mr. Brown said.
   John Vasconcellos, a Democratic assemblyman from San Jose,
said the plan may hurt more people than it helps. "In the
long term, it's penny-wise and pound-foolish," Mr.
Vasconcellos said.
