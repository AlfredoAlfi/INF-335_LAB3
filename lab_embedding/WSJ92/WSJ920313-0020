Financing Business:
   Moody's Lowers Debt Secured by
   Building In Lower Manhattan
The rating agency stressed that its move has nothing to do
with Olympia  York's financial condition. The notes are
secured only by the building, located at 55 Water St., and
not by the company.
   The 53-story lower Manhattan building currently houses
offices of Citicorp, Chemical Bank and Morgan Stanley  Co.,
but with many leases coming up for renewal this year, Moody's
said the building's cash flow is almost certain to come down.
   "You have the leasing exposure when the market is very
weak," said Moody's associate director Jeffrey Fastov. The
rating was lowered from Baa-1 to Ba-1. Ba-1 is Moody's lowest
investment-grade rating, Mr. Fastov said.
   In a statement, Moody's said the "credit concerns
regarding the building are somewhat reduced by the fact that
Olympia  York is in active negotiations with potential
tenants for space in the building." The vacancy rate in the
3.2 million-square-foot property is about 10%, Mr. Fastov
said.
   An Olympia  York spokesman declined to comment.
