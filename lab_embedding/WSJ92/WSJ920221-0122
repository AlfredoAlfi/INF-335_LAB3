U.S. Steel Imports
   Increased in December
   From Month Before
For the full year, imports fell 8.32% to 15,741,000 tons
from the 1990 level of 17,169,000. The American Iron and
Steel Institute, said, however, that imports rose the last
five months of the year, which indicates "the potential for a
flood of imports after the Voluntary Restraint Agreements
expire March 31."
   But the American Institute for International Steel noted
that imports were 13.4% of U.S. consumption for the year,
well below the 20.1% ceiling allowed by the Voluntary
Restraint Agreements. The international association also
noted that full-year exports of U.S.-produced steel increased
47.5% from 1990.
