Business Brief:
   Seagate Rebounds From Loss, Posts Net
   Higher Than Expected For Its 2nd Period
The results were announced after stock markets closed.
According to a Zacks Investment survey, analysts had expected
the company to have a break-even quarter at best, although in
recent days some had boosted their expectations for the
latest quarter, pushing the stock higher. In national
over-the-counter trading late yesterday, Seagate was quoted
at $12.75, up 87.5 cents.
   For the fiscal first half, Seagate reported a net loss of
$36.8 million, or 56 cents a share, on sales of $1.32
billion, compared with profit of $41.7 million, or 65 cents a
share, on sales of $1.32 billion a year earlier. The company
had a net loss in the latest first quarter of $47.8 million,
or 72 cents a share, reflecting price cutting, stagnant
demand and costs related to staff cuts.
   "The market was better than what we anticipated," Alan
Shugart, chief executive, said in an interview. "Everything
seems to be doing reasonably well. The sales increase was
pretty well spread across the product line." If its
competitors report similar surprises, "then the whole
computer market is better than generally thought," Mr.
Shugart added.
