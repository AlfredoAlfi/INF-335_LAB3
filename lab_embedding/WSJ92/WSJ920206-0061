   Suit Against Lotus
   Over Software Delay
   Is Dismissed by Judge
The suit alleged that while certain defendants and Lotus
officers sold "substantial" personal holdings at
"artificially inflated prices," other shareholders suffered
when the price of Lotus shares fell after delays in the
product were announced.
   In his ruling, Judge Joseph Tauro said that the plaintiffs
"may not simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege
they should have been made earlier," adding that "especially
where, as here, a product is understood to be in development,
plaintiffs may not assert merely that, because the product
did not come out when projected, plans for an earlier release
were false."
   Tom Lemberg, Lotus vice president and general counsel,
said the company "is extremely gratified and delighted." He
added, "We always knew this was a frivolous case, and we're
glad that the court has agreed that their complaint does not
state a claim against Lotus."
   The product, originally planned for release in mid-1988,
was shipped in June 1989.
