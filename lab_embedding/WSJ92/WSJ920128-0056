International Brief -- Philippine Airlines:
   Sale of Government Airline
   Appears to Be on Schedule
Pre-bid meetings between government officials selling the
airline and three groups of investors trying to buy it
proceeded despite the audit commission's surprise criticism,
which questioned important elements of the privatization
proposal. An official close to the sale said there were no
plans to cancel Thursday's auction.
   Nonetheless, the commission's objections have cast a
shadow over the auction, raising serious doubts about whether
the sale can finally take off this week after nearly six
years of on-again, off-again efforts to sell the state-owned
carrier.
   The commission doesn't have the power to prohibit the
sale, but without its approval, potential bidders would be
reluctant to proceed because of the likelihood of legal
action against them.
