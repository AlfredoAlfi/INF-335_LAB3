Philadelphia Electric to Be
   More Aggressive Over Bills
In 1991 the utility wrote off as uncollectible $73 million
in bills, up from $33 million in 1988. In that period, the
size of charged-off bills has risen to an average $927 from
$488. About 4% of the customers are responsible for the
chargeoffs.
   The utility said its policies have been among the most
lenient in the state, with service for delinquent customers
extended an average of 90 days, about twice the industry
average. The company is trying to trim that period to about
49 days. State regulations permit service to be shut off
after 40 days delinquency.
   The spokesman noted that the company has programs to
identify customers with true economic problems or who are
unable to handle their bill paying properly. More than 25,000
customers are enrolled in an assistance program, it said.
