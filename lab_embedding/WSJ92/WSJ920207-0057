Business Brief -- Source Perrier S.A.:
   Agnelli Group to Continue
   To Seek Control of Firm
The Agnellis, who control Italy's Fiat S.p.A. auto group,
last year launched a friendly bid for Exor, after buying out
most of the shares of the family that controlled it. But
other big French shareholders in Exor and Perrier complained
that the bid wasn't attractive enough. Nestle, noting that
Exor and its allies actually hold less than half of Perrier
shares, saw its chance. It stepped in last month with a bid
for all of Perrier.
