Bellweather Futures,
   Morgan Guaranty
   Are Fined by Comex
Comex took the action earlier this month, but didn't make
any public announcement. The fines were disclosed in the
current issue of Securities Week, a Wall Street newsletter.
   Comex fined Morgan Guaranty $20,000 and issued a
cease-and-desist order to settle a complaint alleging
violations of exchange rules on misconduct and conduct
detrimental to the best interests of the exchange. Bellwether
Futures, which is no longer a member of the exchange, was
fined $4,000 to settle a similar complaint.
   The broker, Evan Meyers, was fined $16,000 and was issued
a cease-and-desist order to settle a complaint against him.
In addition to misconduct and conduct detrimental to the best
interests of the exchange, the complaint also alleged he
violated rules on noncompetitive trading, disclosure of
customer's orders, improper cross-trading, prearranged
trading, and withholding orders.
   Morgan Guaranty, Paul Tudor Jones and Comex all declined
to comment. Mr. Meyers couldn't be reached.
