Marketing  Media:
   Sony Unit Tries Soundtrack
   To Boost `Gladiator' Film
Columbia, a unit of Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures
Entertainment, said it could give away as many as one million
certificates redeemable for soundtracks tomorrow at the 1,300
theaters where the movie will open. At that rate, industry
executives figured the promotion could add as much as $3
million to $4 million to the film's marketing budget.
   The movie, a drama about a group of young men caught in
the sleazy world of underground boxing, had previously been
scheduled to open last October. Its opening was delayed,
however, when Sony Pictures executives insisted that the
film's hip music be central to selling the movie. A
soundtrack was quickly cobbled together and the
music-marketing campaign was developed. The promotion is
highly synergistic: The soundtrack is being distributed by
Sony Records' Columbia label.
