   In Pennsylvania Sue
   Over Tax on Sales
The tax will affect a range of publications, from Rodale
Press, Emmaus, the publisher of Organic Gardening, to TV
Guide, Radnor, owned by News Corp. The publishers argue that
collecting taxes on subscriptions will be "difficult and
expensive," particularly for small publishers, and that the
revenue collected from subscriptions for the state will be
"almost immaterial."
