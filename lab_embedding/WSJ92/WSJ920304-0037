Greyhound Driver Program
   Is Faulted in 2 Bus Crashes
Greyhound replaced about 6,000 Amalgamated Transit Union
drivers with new hires after a strike that began in March
1990. The company currently employs about 3,320 drivers.
   The NTSB investigated a June 1991 accident in which one
passenger was killed and 16 were injured after a Greyhound
bus plunged over an embankment near Donegal, Pa. Also
investigated was an August 1991 crash in which 31 people were
injured after a Greyhound bus overturned near Caroline, N.Y.
Greyhound drivers were cited for traffic violations in both
incidents.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Dunn said the company had not
had time to review or specifically respond to the NTSB
report.
   Separately, Greyhound said that, without admitting
liability, it had agreed to pay a $150,000 fine to settle a
Federal Highway Administration case involving alleged
violations of federal motor carrier regulations.
