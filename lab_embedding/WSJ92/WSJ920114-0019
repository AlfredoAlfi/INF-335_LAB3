Business Brief -- Health Management Associates:
   Firm Expects to Post Rise
   In Fiscal First-Quarter Net
Health Management expects to report that operating profit
jumped to between 26 cents and 29 cents a share, William
Schoen, chairman, president and chief executive officer,
said. Mr. Schoen said the results will include an
extraordinary gain of $1.3 million, or 10 cents a share, from
the refinancing of a hospital bond issue.
   The expected gains come on a larger number of average
shares outstanding -- about 12 million, compared with 8.3
million a year earlier.
   Mr. Schoen said revenue rose 28% to $65 million from $50.7
million a year earlier. He credited Health Management's
success in the quarter to the company's continuing efforts to
expand the number of services it offers in its hospitals.
