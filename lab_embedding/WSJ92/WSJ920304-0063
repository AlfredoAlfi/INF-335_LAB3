Business Brief -- Transco Energy Co.:
   Unit Files for Rate Increase
   And an Incentive Program
The incentive rate-making program would set rates based on
an average cost of service for the industry. The approach of
using the costs of other pipelines to set rates would create
incentives for Transcontinental Gas to lower costs. By
establishing a zone of reasonable operating income around a
target rate of return, any excess or deficit would be shared
with customers. Rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in
industry average costs.
