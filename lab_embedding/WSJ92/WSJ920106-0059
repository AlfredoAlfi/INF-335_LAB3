Business Brief -- Mitek Systems Inc.:
   Major Shareholder Converts
   Preferred Stock to Common
The trust exercised its right to convert its about 327,000
shares of Mitek preferred on a 10-for-1 basis to common
stock. The conversion continues to give the trust 50% voting
control over the company and doubles the common stock
outstanding.
   Mr. Thornton said the transaction was undertaken to
simplify the company's capital structure by eliminating the
preferred status of his holding, adding that the trust no
longer needed that preferred status. The stock closed Friday
in over-the-counter trading at $1.44 a share, up 6.25 cents.
