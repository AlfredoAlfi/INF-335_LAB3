International:
   Japan's Computer Sales Decline
On a volume basis, shipments of personal computers made by
Japanese manufacturers are expected to total between 2.2
million and 2.3 million units, a drop of around 15% from the
year before, according to an association official. The number
of computers sold has fallen twice before -- in fiscal 1982
and fiscal 1980.
   Association officials cited the world-wide computer slump
and Japan's economic slowdown as reasons for the industry's
"gloomy situation."
