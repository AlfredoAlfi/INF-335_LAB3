Tecnol Seeks Control of Anago
Tecnol said it hopes the offer will allow it to acquire a
large enough interest in Anago to elect a majority of Anago's
directors and, ultimately, to merge the two companies.
Previously Tecnol said it had proposed acquiring Anago for a
total of about $14 million, including the shares it already
owned. Anago also is a Fort Worth medical products maker.
