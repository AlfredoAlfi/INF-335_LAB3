Business Brief -- Hyundai Motor Co.:
   Car Maker's Canadian Unit
   To Cut '92 Output by 15%
Hyundai temporarily closed the plant last Friday because
of a shortage of auto parts caused by labor strife at
Hyundai's main plant in South Korea, he said.
   The Bromont plant will resume its normal five-day workweek
on March 16 to catch up on orders, he said. The switch to a
three-day workweek will occur on March 30 and is expected to
last until October, the spokesman said.
   Hyundai said all of the plant's 900 workers will keep
their jobs when the switch is made. Hyundai said it asked the
Canadian government to pay unemployment insurance to the
workers to make up for the two days of wages they will lose
each week. The government is expected to approve the request
by mid-March, the spokesman said.
