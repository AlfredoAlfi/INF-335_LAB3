International Brief -- Atlas Copco AB:
   Swedish Firm's Pretax Profit
   Declined 28% During 1991
The preliminary results were in line with market
expectations.
   For 1992, the group expects the world economy to remain
weak, especially in the first half. But, the group added, "as
a result of the restructuring measures that have been taken,
earnings are expected to gradually increase during the year,
subject to business conditions not deteriorating further."
   Order bookings in 1991 slipped 4.5% to 15.22 billion
kronor, while the backlog of orders at year's end amounted to
2.68 billion kronor, down 5.3%.
   Sales in Germany, East Asia and Mexico developed favorably
during the year, while sales remained weak in the Nordic
countries, the U.K., Canada, Brazil and Australia.
