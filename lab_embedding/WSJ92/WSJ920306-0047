U.S. May Aid Weak SLs
   To Merge, Bowsher Says
Moreover, some lawmakers, including House Banking
Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, (D., Texas), claim the
plan is illegal. Rep. Gonzalez contends the law limits the
use of bailout funds only to the protection of depositors in
failed thrifts -- not their owners.
   Mr. Bowsher, testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee, didn't specifically address the merits of such a
plan, but contended that it isn't banned by statute. In a
recent letter to Bush administration officials, he said the
1989 bailout law "does not contain any language concerning
the purposes for which the {bailout} funds may be used."
