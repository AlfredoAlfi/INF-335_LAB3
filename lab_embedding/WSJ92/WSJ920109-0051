Panel Backs Reports
   For Large Positions
   In Treasury Securities
But the group generally supported the idea, arguing that
it would be a cost-effective way to avoid "squeezes" such as
the ones that Salomon Brothers Inc. set off in May when it
illegally cornered the market for two-year notes.
   The group specifically said that it favors large-position
reporting, in which investors would have to tell the
government that they own a large stake, over large-trade
reporting, in which they would have to inform regulators
whenever they buy or sell a chunk of securities.
   Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House
Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, has proposed a
bill that would force large-trade reporting.
   The report comes as top government financial officials are
putting the finishing touches on a report about ways to
change the government-securities market in the wake of the
Salomon scandal.
