Business Brief -- MorningStar Group Inc.:
   Dairy Products Firm Plans
   5.95 Million Share Offering
MorningStar, based in Dallas, took on a mound of debt in a
1988 leveraged buy-out. It had been part of Southland Corp.
MorningStar was struggling with $35 million of annual
interest expense and mounting losses in March 1991 when Hicks
Muse  Co., a Dallas investment company, and a group of banks
combined to infuse the company with new equity. Hicks Muse
paid $30 million to acquire 80% of MorningStar's equity.
   MorningStar plans to use proceeds of the offering to
retire debt and preferred shares held by Hicks Muse, which
isn't planning to sell shares in the offering.
