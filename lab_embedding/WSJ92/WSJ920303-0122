International:
   Sega Enterprises to Buy W.D.K.
W.D.K. is a supplier of equipment for the EuroDisneyland
amusement park due to open in Paris in April, the spokesman
said, adding that Sega hopes to increase its access to
European markets through the purchase.
   This will mark Sega's second acquisition of a European
company; in January 1991, it bought U.K. game maker Deith
Leisure Ltd.
