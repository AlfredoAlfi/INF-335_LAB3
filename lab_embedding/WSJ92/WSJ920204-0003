Joseph Horne Co.
   Restructures Debt;
   Board Won't Change
Under terms, Horne, a closely held retailer, saves $4
million to $5 million a year in interest payments by
converting $47 million of debt and preferred stock into
common stock.
   The move prompted Horne's lenders, led by PNC Financial
Corp.'s Pittsburgh National Bank unit, to give the retailer a
five-year extension of a $87.4 million credit line and a
three-year extension of a $85 million revolving credit line.
The agreements were scheduled to expire in May.
   That move soothed nervous suppliers who were asking for
up-front cash payments because they were dubious about
Horne's ability to get renew its credit agreements, Mr. Pulte
said.
   Before the restructuring, Horne's key investors, Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the United States, Massachusetts
Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Mitsui  Co. each held a 10.8%
stake in the retailer, with most of the rest controlled by a
venture capital firm. Equitable's stake was divided among
itself, Merrill Lynch  Co.'s Merrill Lynch Life Insurance
Co. and Integrity Life Insurance Co.
   Now Equitable holds a 34% stake, Mitsui holds a 28% stake
and Massachusetts Mutual holds a 26% stake.
