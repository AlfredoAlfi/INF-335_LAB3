Business Brief -- May Department Stores Co.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Jumped
   5.6% With 2.4% Sales Rise
May said that the profit gain came despite "two years of a
difficult economy." The lingering recession continued to
pinch May's same-store sales -- those at locations open at
least a year; those sales slipped 0.5% in the quarter.
   The company said its new merchandise and customer service
initiatives, which includes stocking more colors and sizes,
will benefit May "with any improvement in the economic
climate."
   For all of 1991, May's net income rose 3% to $515 million,
or $4.02 a share, from $500 million, or $3.88 a share.
Revenue increased 5.5% to $10.62 billion from $10.07 billion.
