Business Brief -- Union Carbide Corp.:
   UCIG Unit Gains Control
   Of Italy and Spain Ventures
After the transaction, UCIG said it had bolstered its
stake in Italiana Gas Industriali S.p.A, Milan, to 55.5% from
37.5%. The company's Italy-based partners in the venture,
Flow Fin and EniChem S.p.A., hold 37% and 7.5% stakes,
respectively.
   In its Spanish gases venture, Argon S.A., UCIG "inched up"
its investment to give it a controlling interest, or
"slightly more" than a 50% stake, a spokesman said. The
remaining stake is locally owned, he said.
   The transactions "further confirm our company's commitment
to the industrial gases business in Europe and our plans to
increase participation in industrial gases markets
world-wide," said UCIG President Ed Hotard.
   The parent last month said it would spin off its huge
industrial-gases businesses.
