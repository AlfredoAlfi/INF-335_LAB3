   Convex Computer
   Posts $937,000 Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
The company had forecast an improvement from the third
quarter based on increasing sales. Convex is in the midst of
a transition from its second generation of supercomputers to
a third-generation line and, for a time, the new computers
weren't widely available.
   For all of 1991, Convex had a loss of $6.9 million, or 31
cents a share, on revenue of $198.1 million. That compared
with profit of $18.4 million, or 88 cents a share, on revenue
of $209.3 million in 1990.
   Robert J. Paluck, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said Convex was hurt in 1991 by "poor world-wide
economic conditions, a very competitive sales environment and
our new product transition." The company has been focusing on
increasing the availability of new products, he said. In the
fourth quarter, Convex shipped 46 of its latest-generation
supercomputers and a record 116 processors.
   "Assuming the economic climate doesn't deteriorate, and we
have adequate supplies of semiconductor components, we are
optimistic concerning the outlook for Convex in 1992," Mr.
Paluck said.
   Convex, whose stock dipped as low as $9.125 a share in
November, rose 87.5 cents to $15 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Friday.
