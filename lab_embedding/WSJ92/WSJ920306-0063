Florida Agency Sues Milken
Florida is filing its case just as other plaintiffs
against Mr. Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., where he
headed the junk-bond department, are hashing out a $1.3
billion settlement to their claims before a federal judge in
New York.
   Florida's attorney, Thomas Tew, of Tew  Garcia-Pedrosa in
Miami, is attending the settlement negotiations in New York.
"We want a position at the negotiating table," he said. If
the settlement fails, he said, the state will proceed with
its suit.
   A spokesman for Mr. Milken called the Florida suit
"without merit." He also characterized the action as "an
obvious attempt to become part of the settlement should the
settlement go through."
