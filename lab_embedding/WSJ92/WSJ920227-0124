   An Early Prospectus
   For Initial Offering
According to the preliminary prospectus for the IPO,
Quebecor Printing is the second-largest commercial printer in
North America. Quebecor Printing had net income of US$33.2
million, or 82 U.S. cents a share, on revenue of US$1.39
billion in 1991. Quebecor Printing reports its results in
U.S. dollars because the concern's American operations
account for about two-thirds of its revenue.
   According to the prospectus, an unspecified number of
Quebecor Printing subordinate voting shares will be sold
publicly in Canada and by private placement in the U.S.
People close to the underwriting group said the IPO is
expected to raise 150 million to 200 million Canadian dollars
(US$126.5 million to US$168.6 million). The underwriting
group is led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc. and ScotiaMcLeod
Inc. The size and price of the IPO will be set in April when
the final prospectus is filed.
   The subordinate voting shares carry one vote each.
Quebecor Printing now has 39,965,005 multiple voting shares
outstanding. The multiple voting shares carry ten votes each.
Quebecor owns 92.9% and Caisse de depot et placement, the
Quebec government's pension fund agency, 7.1% of the multiple
voting shares, which aren't publicly traded.
   On the American Stock Exchange, Quebecor Class A shares
closed at $11 a share, down 25 cents.
