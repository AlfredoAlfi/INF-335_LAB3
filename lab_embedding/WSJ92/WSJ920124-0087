Who's News:
   Andrew Large to Head
   UK Securities Board
His appointment, announced by the Department of Trade and
Industry, comes only three months after he was named chairman
of the London Futures and Options Exchange, or London Fox, to
set it back on the rails in the wake of a marketrigging
scandal.
   Previously, Mr. Large, 49 years old, was the first
chairman of the Securities Association, now merged with the
Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers to form the
Securities and Futures Authority, from November 1986 to
December 1987.
   At SIB, the umbrella body that oversees a number of market
regulatory organizations including the SFA, Mr. Large will
succeed Sir David Walker, who has been chairman of the SIB
since 1988 and is stepping down at the end of his term.
