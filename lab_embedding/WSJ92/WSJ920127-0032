Business Brief -- RMI Titanium Co.:
   Firm Posts Loss, Including
   A Charge for Plant Closing
Titanium sponge is the raw material used to make mill
products.
   RMI decided to close the plant because "the recessionary
economy, weak aerospace demand and excess inventories at our
customers' plants have combined to create a difficult
market," said L. Frederick Gieg Jr., president and chief
executive officer.
   The company will now get its titanium sponges from Oregon
Metalurgical Corp., based in Albany, Ore.; Osaka Titanium Co.
of Nagasaki, Japan; Sumitomo Corp. of Japan; and Sumitomo's
U.S. affiliate, Sumitomo Corp. of America.
