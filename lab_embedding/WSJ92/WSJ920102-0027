International Brief -- Repsol S.A.:
   Oil Concern and La Caixa
   Create Big Spanish Utility
Repsol owns 36% of Catalana while La Caixa controls 24.8%
of the Barcelona-based company. Spain's Instituto Nacional de
Hidrocarburos holds 87% of Gas Madrid through Repsol.
   In February, Repsol, the state oil group, and La Caixa
agreed to merge the two gas utilities, forming a national gas
company, to be named Gas Natural S.A.
   Last week, Spain's Finance Ministry recommended exempting
Repsol and La Caixa from paying a 12.49 billion peseta
($129.1 million) capital gains tax on the merger. The
decision cleared the way to finalize the agreement and
integrate both company's gas interests, Repsol said.
   Repsol officials project that the company's investments
will reach 120 billion pesetas over the next five years. Cash
flow from the merged operation in 1992 is expected to total
20 billion pesetas.
