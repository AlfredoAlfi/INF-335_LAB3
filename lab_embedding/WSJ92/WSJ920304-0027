International Brief -- Abbey National PLC:
   Pretax Profit Climbed 6.2%
   In '91, Hitting #618 Million
The bank, whose results met market forecasts, said loan
charges in the latest year included #117 million in
provisions against U.K. residential mortgages. Total charges
in 1991 were up sharply from #55 million in 1990, reflecting
rising arrears and house repossessions in Britain.
   Abbey National, which is primarily a mortgage lender given
its former status as a U.K. building society, said
repossessions last year totaled 8,732 properties, up 85% from
1990's 4,711.
   The lender also maintained that it believes the "worst of
the current recession is past." And it said that as
"confidence returns, the level of activity in the housing
market will begin to recover." It added, however, that it
still expects loan "provisions will remain high in 1992."
   Abbey National's real estate unit showed little
improvement, although its pretax loss narrowed marginally to
#19 million from #20 million in 1990.
   Profit attributable to shareholders, or net profit, rose
9.8% in 1991 to #414 million against #377 million a year
earlier. Abbey National said the rise in net profit largely
reflected lower tax charges in the latest year.
