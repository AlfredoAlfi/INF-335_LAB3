Business Brief -- Reynolds Metals Co.:
   Company to Pay $420,000
   To Settle Dumping Charges
A spokesman for Reynolds said it settled to avoid time and
costs of further litigation. He said the company has invested
"a great deal of time and resources" in PCB cleanup work at
the Massena plant over the past three years.
   Part of the penalty will go to a pilot project downstream
to ensure a supply of uncontaminated fish for a nearby Mohawk
Indian community, state officials said. The agreement would
settle a 1988 lawsuit brought by the Atlantic States Legal
Foundation, a citizens group, and joined by the state in
1989, that charged Reynolds with unpermitted discharges of
PCBs into the river.
   The agreement still must be approved in U.S. District
Court in Syracuse, N.Y.
   Reynolds also agreed to pay state attorney fees of
$20,000, the foundation's attorney fees of $75,000 and $8,000
for the foundation's continuing oversight of the settlement
terms.
