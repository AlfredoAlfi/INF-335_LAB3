Abbott Ex-President
   Sues Firm Over Pact
   On Noncompetition
The current suit seeks damages over three jobs Mr. Schuler
says Abbott denied him because of its noncompetition
agreement.
   Mr. Schuler was forced out as Abbott's president two years
ago during the tenure of former Abbott chairman Robert
Schoellhorn. Mr. Schoellhorn himself was forced out by the
Abbott board less than a year later.
   Abbott said that the suit is without merit. Mr. Schuler
declined to comment.
