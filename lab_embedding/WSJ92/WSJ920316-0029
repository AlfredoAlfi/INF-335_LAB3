International:
   Japanese Commission
   Orders 13 Ink Makers
   To Stop Fixing Prices
A final judgment on the amount of surcharges to be paid
will be reached in April or thereafter, the official said. In
addition to imposing surcharges, designed to strip the
companies of artificially inflated revenues, the commission
can also press criminal charges, which could add extra fines.
   Under pressure from U.S. trade officials, who assert that
collusive behavior in certain Japanese industries shuts out
imports, Japan's FTC has recently been turning up the heat on
cartels. In November, the commission slapped eight makers of
plastic food wrap with its first criminal price-fixing case
in 17 years. And through an administrative action similar to
the one effected against the ink makers, 12 cement makers
were fined a record 11.2 billion yen ($83.5 million) last
year.
   The commission has also proposed raising the maximum
criminal penalty for companies to 100 million yen from five
million yen. The proposal is expected to be submitted to
lawmakers in the Diet, or parliament, this month.
