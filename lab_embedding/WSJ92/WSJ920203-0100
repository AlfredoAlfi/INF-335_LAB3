Procordia to Restructure
The plans to restructure Procordia have been under way
since the beginning of last summer, said Klas Rasaetter, head
of information at Procordia. "They will proceed regardless of
the Volvo merger."
   The restructuring is scheduled for completion by April 1,
the group said.
   No reductions in personnel are planned in connection with
the restructuring at this stage, said Mr. Rasaetter.
