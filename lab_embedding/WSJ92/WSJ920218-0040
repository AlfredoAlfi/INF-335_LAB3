   Special to The Wall Street Journal
A Milan newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, said Mr. Pirelli
quit as chief executive at the insistence of banks financing
the company's restructuring program. The paper's account
couldn't be confirmed. However, Mr. Pirelli had been under
pressure since the costly failure late last year of his
attempt to merge Pirelli's tire interests with German rival
Continental AG.
   Mr. Pirelli will stay on as chairman, while Mr. Tronchetti
Provera will become executive vice chairman, in additon to
managing director, the spokesman said.
   Separately, Pirelli also said capital increases for units
Pirelli  C. S.p.A. and Societe Internationale Pirelli S.A.
were concluded successfully, paving the way for its own 519
billion lire ($425.6 million) rights issue Feb. 17.
