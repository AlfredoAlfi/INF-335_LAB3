   Japan Urges Auto Makers
   To Assist U.S. Companies
President Bush, accompanied by the chairmen of the three
major U.S.-auto makers and 18 other business leaders, is due
in Tokyo on Jan. 7 to discuss ways of narrowing Japan's $41
billion trade surplus with the U.S. Autos and car parts
account for three-fourths of that gap.
   Mr. Miyazawa urged Japanese auto companies to help sell
American cars in Japan and to spend a year or two to help
U.S. companies develop auto parts that could be used by
Japanese firms.
   In early December, major Japanese auto makers said they
planned to nearly double purchases of U.S. auto parts by 1994
as part of a government-inspired effort to reduce the trade
surplus. On Sunday, Japan's leading economic newspaper said
the auto makers planned additional increases in their
purchases of U.S.-made parts. There also were reports of a
government plan to introduce subsidies to encourage Japanese
to buy imported cars.
