Ex-Principal of FSG,
   Defunct California
   Firm, Charged by U.S.
The Securities and Exchange Commission closed FSG
Financial Services last July.
   The charges were filed in the form of an information,
which usually indicates that a guilty plea is coming. Mr.
Scher could face as long as 28 years in prison and a fine of
as much as $54.5 million.
   Prosecutors said Mr. Scher wasn't the mastermind of the
alleged scheme but was the deputy of another person who
hasn't yet been charged. "He was the colonel. The general's
still out there," said assistant U.S. attorney David J.
Schindler.
   Mr. Scher's attorney wasn't available for comment.
