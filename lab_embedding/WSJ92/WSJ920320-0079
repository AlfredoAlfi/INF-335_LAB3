Business Brief -- America West Airlines:
   Shareholder Committee Files
   Objections to Reorganization
The reorganization plan, disclosed on Sunday but not yet
submitted to the bankruptcy court, wipes out common and
preferred stock and in effect makes unsecured creditors the
owners of the new company that emerges from Chapter 11.
America West, which filed under the federal Bankruptcy Code
last June, said the plan would allow the company to keep
flying at least its current routes.
   A spokesman for America West, Phoenix, Ariz.,
characterized the severance package as standard in Chapter 11
proceedings and said it permits top employees to do their job
without personal financial concerns. The spokesman said he'd
not read the shareholder committee's objections, but denied
the charge that the company has not been forthcoming about
its financial condition.
