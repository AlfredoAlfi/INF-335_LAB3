Nomination of Greenspan
   Is Cleared by Senate Panel
The panel vote was 20-1. The lone dissenter was Alfonse
D'Amato (R., N.Y.), who has been harshly critical of Mr.
Greenspan's tenure as Fed chairman. Although Democrats on the
committee also have been critical of the 65-year-old Mr.
Greenspan, they voted for him in the end.
   The panel also unanimously approved the nomination of J.
Carter Beese to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
