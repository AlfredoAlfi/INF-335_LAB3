Business Brief -- Dean Foods Co.:
   Majority Stake Is Sought
   In Norcal Crosetti Foods
It is one of a dwindling number of vegetable packers in
California, as many have shifted operations south of the
U.S.-Mexico border and others have consolidated.
   Dean, a food processor and distributor with a big presence
in dairy products, said the pact is subject to a number of
conditions, including definitive agreements and regulators'
approval.
   A Dean spokeswoman declined to discuss Norcal's
profitability. As part of the transaction, she said, Dean
acquired an option to buy the rest of Norcal.
