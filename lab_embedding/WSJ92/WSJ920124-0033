Technology Brief -- Digital Equipment Corp.:
   Unit, Seiko Epson Agree
   To Conduct Joint Research
Digital Equipment, based in Maynard, Mass., is believed to
lag behind other computer companies in its entry into the
Japanese market in this sector. For Seiko Epson, which faces
increasing competition in its main business of personal
computers, the move marks the company's desire to expand from
PC manufacturing to involvement in a more broad-based system
network.
   The Digital spokeswoman said details on the linkup are
still being worked out. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major
economic daily, reported on Friday that the two companies
plan to jointly develop a network system before the end of
this year and put it on the market.
