Business Brief -- Geneva Steel:
   Utah Concern Posts Deficit
   Of $4.8 Million for Quarter
Geneva said earnings were hurt primarily by upgrading work
at its facilities, which slowed production and increased
costs, as well as by lowered industrywide prices.
   Industry analysts expecting a near break-even quarter were
surprised by the big loss. James Bellessa Jr., an analyst
with D.A. Davidson, said he thought the company's earnings
will be "touch and go" in the second quarter until its
modernization efforts are completed.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Geneva closed
at $18.625, down $1.125.
