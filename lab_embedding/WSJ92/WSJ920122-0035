Business Brief -- Mobil Corp.:
   IRS Claims That It's Owed
   $300 Million in Back Taxes
The IRS contends that Mobil and the other petroleum
companies that comprised the Saudi-U.S. consortium called
Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco, bought crude oil from
Saudi Arabia at below market prices during the Iran-Iraq war
and passed the lower prices through to affiliates. The IRS
maintains Mobil should have charged its affiliates higher
prices for this oil, resulting in taxes on higher profits.
   Two other Aramco companies, Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc.,
are currently involved in litigation with the IRS on a
similar issue, according to Mobil, while Chevron Corp., the
fourth Aramco partner, is still in talks with the agency.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Mobil
rose $1.50 to $69.75.
