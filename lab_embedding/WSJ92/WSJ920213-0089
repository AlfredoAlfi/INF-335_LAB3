House Panel Approves
   Bill to Discourage Use
   Of Large Drift Nets
Rep. Gerry Studds (D., Mass.), the bill's principal
author, said it would give the U.S. some leverage to enforce
international fishery conservation programs. Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan are among the countries that historically
have maintained drift net fishing fleets.
   The Studds bill was approved last October by the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. But because it
involved trade policy, the bill also had to be endorsed by
the Ways and Means Committee before going to the House for a
floor vote. No comparable legislation has been passed by the
Senate.
