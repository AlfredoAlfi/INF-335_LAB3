Business Brief -- Inco Ltd.:
   Pension Fund Contribution
   Will Be Partially in Stock
Inco, which is based in Toronto, said it also would
contribute $52 million in cash toward its pension fund.
   Anthony Sabatino, Inco's treasurer, said the shares would
boost the pension fund's holding of Inco stock to 5% of its
assets, the limit set by the Inco board. Under Canadian
regulations, however, this limit could be raised to 10%.
   Although U.S. companies regularly contribute stock to
their employee pension funds, a spokesman for the Ontario
Pension Commission, a government agency, said this is the
first time he has seen it occur in Canada.
