Credit Ratings:
   Turner Broadcasting
   Has Long-Term Debt
   Upgraded by Moody's
While Turner's debt is still two notches below investment
grade in Moody's scale, the change reflects Wall Street's
much-improved view of Turner's balance sheet in the five
years since Turner took on massive debt to acquire the MGM
film library. Turner's long-term debt has traded recently at
levels that would be considered high for most junk bonds,
notes Ned Zachar, a debt analyst with Duff  Phelps in
Chicago.
   Turner has been moving toward the use of equity rather
than debt. The company completed an exchange of preferred
stock for common last year. And, in its acquisition of
Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc. for $320 million last month,
Turner minimized debt by entering a joint venture with Apollo
Investment Fund, which said it has an option to acquire
Turner stock in the future.
   Moody's said Turner will continue investing heavily in
programming, so the agency doesn't expect significant debt
reduction. But the agency said cash flow will increase as a
result of Turner's cable-programming franchise and
improvements in the industry.
   "We view the outlook for cable companies as positive,"
said Craig Fitt, a Moody's analyst.
