International Brief -- Delft Instruments N.V.:
   Dutch Concern Says Losses
   Will Top Previous Forecast
In the first half of 1991, Delft posted net losses of 17
million guilders.
   Delft said it was forced to revise its forecast because
sales in the second half of the year were lower than expected
at 190 million guilders. For all of 1991, sales amounted to
360 million guilders, down from 433 million guilders in 1990.
   Although slumping sales likely hurt the company, the main
problem Delft faced in 1991 was a U.S. embargo that prevented
Delft from using U.S.-made products that were integral parts
of some of its equipment. The U.S. imposed the ban after
learning that Delft's night vision devices were shipped to
Iraq and Jordan after the arms embargo was imposed on Iraq.
