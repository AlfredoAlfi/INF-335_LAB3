Money Market Funds
   Post a Rise in Assets
   For the Latest Week
"Steep increases in assets of money market mutual funds,
pretty typical at the start of the year, continue despite
further declines in yields offered by both taxable and
tax-exempt funds," said Dr. Jacob Dreyer, the institute's
vice president and chief economist, in a statement. "But the
rate of increase has slowed considerably from the torrid pace
of the first two weeks of the year.
   "The slowdown, especially pronounced for the institutional
funds," Dr. Dreyer added, "was assisted by the fairly sharp
rise in the federal funds rate which rendered yields on
institutional money market funds relatively less attractive."
   Assets of money market mutual funds for the week ended
Wednesday Jan. 15, weren't revised.
