   French Bourse Watchdog
   Approves Bid for Perrier
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
But the bourse approval is a setback for Italy's powerful
Agnelli family, which with a group of allies currently
controls Perrier. Also, the Agnellis appealed a regulator's
ruling requiring it and three allies to bid for 100% of the
mineral water bottler.
   Meanwhile, the regulator of France's financial markets,
the Commission des Operations de Bourse, is investigating a
sale earlier this month of a 13.8% stake in Perrier to Saint
Louis S.A., a French sugar, paper and frozen foods group. The
regulator could order Saint Louis's stake annulled if it is
determined that Exor S.A., the holding company that has a
large Perrier stake and is in turn controlled by the Agnelli
family, and Perrier knew that Nestle was preparing a bid for
the company when the water group sold the shares to Saint
Louis.
   Perrier shares remain suspended from trading. The shares
last traded on Jan. 17 at 1,396 francs.
