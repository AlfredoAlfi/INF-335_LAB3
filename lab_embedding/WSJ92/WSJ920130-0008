Regency Equities
   Expresses an Interest
   In First Executive Bid
Mr. Goodman said no specific timetable has been set for
transfer of control, nor has First Executive proposed
specific candidates for directorship or the chairmanship.
   The proposal by First Executive and its Evergreen
Acceptance Corp. unit leaves open the possibility that the
bankrupcty court overseeing First Executive's Chapter 11
proceedings may want to review the prospective transaction.
Regency's announcement, made late yesterday, came as a
surprise. "It's news to us," said a lawyer acting for the
creditors' committee. She declined further comment.
   Mr. Goodman said that the 38% stake in Regency is owned
through Evergreen Acceptance, a Delaware-incorporated unit
that isn't in bankruptcy proceedings. "First Executive as far
as I know isn't involved with Regency," he said, adding that
he believed First Executive's bankruptcy, therefore, wasn't
involved with the transaction.
   Los Angeles-based First Executive is the parent company of
Los Angeles-based Executive Life Insurance Co. and Executive
Life Insurance Co. of New York, both of which were seized
last year by insurance regulators.
   Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive of First
Executive, couldn't be reached for comment.
