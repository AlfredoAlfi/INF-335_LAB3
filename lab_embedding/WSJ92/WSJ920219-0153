Incomnet Acquires Right
Sam D. Schwartz, president and chief executive officer of
Incomnet, said the interest in National Telephone
Communications was bought through a "secured creditor
status," which Mr. Schwartz said is convertible into the
controlling interest. He said that interest would be at least
51%, but would more likely total about 65%.
