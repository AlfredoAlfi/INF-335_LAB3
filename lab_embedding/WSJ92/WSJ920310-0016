Interlake Board Clears
   A Financing Package
   For the Company
Interlake said it and its senior bank lenders have agreed
in principle to amend its existing bank credit facilities to
defer $72 million in term loan payments currently scheduled
to become due in 1992 through 1996; modify certain financial
covenants; increase the interest rate applicable to loans by
one-half of 1%; and provide for payment of a 1% loan fee.
   In 1989 Interlake thwarted an unwanted takeover attempt by
Mark IV Industries Inc. by restructuring itself. Under the
plan, the company borrowed $550 million to pay for a special
shareholder dividend and to refinance previous debt holdings.
   A spokesman said the company's total long-term debt is
about $460 million. Of that, $200 million is in the form of
increasing rate notes and about $220 million to $240 million
is senior bank facilities.
   Interlake said completion of the plan is subject to the
successful closing of each element of the plan. The company
said it plans to submit certain aspects of the plan to its
shareholders for their approval.
   The spokesman said that if the plan isn't accomplished,
"we would pursue other alternatives."
