When asked who, if anyone, assumed Mr. Sitomer's
responsibilities, Mr. Cohen said that as trustee, he was
acting as "the senior person in the company."
   Russ Togs and six of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in early November. Later that month,
the apparel-maker said it was putting itself up for sale and
hiring Mr. Cohen, a principal at Alco Capital Inc., New York,
an investment adviser, to serve as a crisis manager, working
with management to stabilize the company and respond to
inquires about its sale.
   Russ Togs reported a wider loss of $16 million, or $2.21 a
share, for its fiscal nine months ended Nov. 2. Sales rose
4.8% to $173.3 million. Its shares closed yesterday at
$1.375, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
