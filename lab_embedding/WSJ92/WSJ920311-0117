   Device Aims to Speed Up
   Heart-Attack Treatment
It's the latest equipment to help emergency squads with
limited medical training, such as police and firemen, to
treat heart-attack victims more swiftly.
   The device, made by MEDphone Corp. of Paramus, N.J.,
includes self-adhesive electrode pads to be attached to
patients, a microprocessor, and a defibrillator, which
delivers electric shocks to the heart to get it beating
normally.
   The MEDphone cellular device, which received marketing
clearance from the Food and Drug Administration last October,
costs about $9,975. The base unit costs $35,000.
