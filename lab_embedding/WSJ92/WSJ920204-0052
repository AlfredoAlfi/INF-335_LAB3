Business Brief -- Uslico Corp.:
   Insurer Expects to Report
   Loss for the Fourth Period
The Ohio firm for several years had been selling the
coverage to small businesses and individuals, and Uslico had
been underwriting the coverage while transferring the risk
through a reinsurance arrangement. However, the reinsurance
coverage lapsed at the end of 1990, and Uslico said it
decided to get out of that business, which was incurring
hefty claims.
   Late in 1991, Consultants  Administrators stopped paying
policyholder claims and agents' commissions on the business.
Uslico said it would continue to pay claims filed before it
terminates the business this spring. It added that it's
trying to transfer the coverage to other carriers.
   Uslico said it expects to post a profit for 1991.
