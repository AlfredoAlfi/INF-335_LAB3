Congress Is Urged to Boost
   Funds to IMF, Program
"Without U.S. support, the IMF quota increase cannot go
into effect. This failure could bring to a halt the West's
response to the new states of the former Soviet Union and
seriously erode U.S. leadership in the Fund."
   Democrats in Congress have warned that the IMF bill isn't
likely to be approved this year unless President Bush himself
makes a strong appeal for it.
   The letter said that the Enterprise for the Americas
initiative, a program intended to strengthen Latin American
economies, is also "fundamental to the economic and security
interests of the United States." The secretaries also noted
that the program would enhance U.S. exports.
