Credit Ratings
LYONDELL PETROCHEMICAL Co. (Houston)-- Standard  Poor's
Corp. said it lowered ratings on about $800 million of
Lyondell's senior debt and commercial paper. Senior debt was
downgraded to triple-B-minus from triple-B, and ratings on
commercial paper lowered to single-A-3 from single-A-2. The
ratings agency said the downgrades reflect Lyondell's
higher-than-anticipated capital spending program and a
continued aggressive dividend policy in the face of a cyclic
industry downturn. SP said Lyondell's 1992 capital spending
is up 167%, to $115 million from 1991's $43 million. Lyondell
also paid out slightly more than 50% of its operating cash
flow in dividends last year, a ratio SP said probably will
climb this year if earnings fall short of 1991 levels.
