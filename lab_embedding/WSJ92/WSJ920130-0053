THE 1993 BUDGET: Bush's Antidote to Recession

   Bush to Target Taxpayers
   Who Cheat on Charity Gifts
The problem, the Treasury Department says, is that filers
aggregate donations on the IRS's Schedule A. That makes it
impossible for the government to distinguish between
charitable donations and payments to those charities for
goods and services, which aren't tax deductible.
   For example, the Treasury contends that it loses
"significant tax revenues" when filers write checks to
charities for items they purchase at auctions but then take
the payment as a deductible contribution.
   A separate proposal would encourage taxpayers to donate
property to charity by broadening an exclusion of such
donations under the alternative minimum tax.
