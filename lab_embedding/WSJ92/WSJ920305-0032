Trade on French Currency
   In Philadelphia Sets Record
The trade made up the lion's share of the total 274,800
currency option contracts traded on the Philadelphia exchange
yesterday. That was an exchange record, surpassing the
previous high volume of 137,000 currency option contracts.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange traded 190,000 options on
futures contracts on Dec. 21, 1991. However, that total
included options on currencies, stock indexes, interest rates
and agricultural futures contracts.
   Joseph Rizzello, president of the option market division
of the Philadelphia exchange, said inquiries were made around
5 a.m. about how big an order the trading floor could handle.
The order, from PaineWebber Inc.'s Paris office, and the
trade, took place at around 8 a.m.
   About 60% of the trade was handled in Philadelphia by
Mitsui TB Options, a unit of Mitsui Trust Bank, and SBC
Derivatives, a unit of Swiss Bank Corp., according to Mr.
Rizzello. The name of the customer originating the trade
wasn't available from PaineWebber in Paris.
