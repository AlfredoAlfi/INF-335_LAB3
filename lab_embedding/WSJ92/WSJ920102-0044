Business Brief -- U S West:
   Company Sells Office Tower
   In Denver With Lease Deal
The transaction, which was completed Tuesday, includes
provisions for U S West to lease back the space. U S West
Communications will continue to occupy about two-thirds of
the building under a 20-year agreement with the new owner.
   Colorado regulators are investigating the lease-back deal,
concerned that higher-than-market rent costs might be passed
on to ratepayers. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is
expected to hold a hearing on the lease rate and its cost to
consumers.
