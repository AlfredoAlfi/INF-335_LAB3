Rockwell's Earnings,
   Sales Dropped by 13%
   In Fiscal 1st Quarter
Sales fell to $2.56 billion from $2.94 billion.
   Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that first-quarter results deteriorated because of "the
significant effect of the depressed world-wide economy on the
markets served by our commercial businesses."
   Rockwell recently said that it expected lower profit in
the first half of fiscal 1992, but thought that an improving
economy would make it possible to achieve full-year profits
comparable to those reported last year.
   However, that goal appears increasingly elusive because of
continuing weakness in the company's automotive and
industrial businesses, Mr. Beall said.
   For the year ended Sept. 30, Rockwell earned $600.5
million, or $2.57 a share, on sales of $11.93 billion.
Excluding a fourth-quarter gain and restructuring charges,
operating profit for the year was $583.6 million or $2.50 a
share.
   Rockwell, a military electronics, aerospace and
machinery-manufacturing concern, said its backlog at Dec. 31
was $15.7 billion, compared with $14.7 billion a year
earlier.
   Rockwell shares were quoted at $27.75, up 75 cents, in
late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
