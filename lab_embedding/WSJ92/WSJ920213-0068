On Holiday, Group Wants
   People to Buy American
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The association, which represents 150,000 small companies
and is based in Grapevine, Texas, said the promotion is
intended to celebrate U.S. entrepreneurship and
craftsmanship. It plans to distribute 10,000 pins, carrying
the slogan, "Buy American Today-BAT-Go to BAT for the U.S.A."
Its members are also seeking to get local officials to
declare Feb. 22 "Buy American Today Day."
   Mr. Frano insisted the campaign isn't intended to "bash
Japan." Indeed, Bernard Foster, an ASBA member and owner of a
Portland, Ore., chain of ethnic newspapers, said, "the
Japanese do a magnificent job of marketing their products and
services -- and we have to do a better job." His Skanner
Newspapers plan to support the promotion, he said.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Robert Kasten (R., Wis.), ranking minority
member of the Senate Small Business Committee, is working
with Mr. Frano's group to extend the campaign. Sen. Kasten
plans next week to seek passage of a joint congressional
resolution calling on President Bush to declare July 4 as
"Buy American Day."
