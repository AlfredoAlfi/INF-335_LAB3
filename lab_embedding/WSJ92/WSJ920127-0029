Business Brief -- Tarmac PLC:
   British Official Sees Harm
   To Competition in Merger
Tarmac and Steetley announced Dec. 2 the formation of a
joint venture, Allied Building Materials Holdings Ltd., by
the two groups' building products divisions.
   The move prompted Redland PLC, a bricks and roofing tile
group, to bid #615 million ($1.1 billion) for Steetley Dec.
10, in a move to stymie Tarmac's plans. The merger is
currently being considered by the EC, which has the power to
make a decision on the issue itself or accede to Mr. Lilley's
wishes and refer the matter to U.K. authorities.
   The Department of Trade and Industry said Tarmac and
Steetley's planned merger is the first of 79 cases where
Britain has notified the EC of a "distinct market competition
problem."
