Dutch Banking Group
   Sells Stake in BEAL
   To German Bank Firm
ABN-AMRO said it sold its holding in BEAL because
following the merger of Algemene Bank Nederland, or ABN, and
Amsterdam-Rotterdam, or AMRO, Bank in August 1990, there was
a duplication of efforts in Latin America.
   ABN-AMRO noted that it will retain its Banco Hollandes
Unido and its stake in the finance company Ayemore to serve
the Latin American market.
   Another factor in the decision to shed its stake in BEAL
may have been AMRO's failed merger attempt with Generale de
Banque, an effort that preceded the successful merger of AMRO
and ABN.
   BEAL's activities are centered in Argentina, Uruguay and
Brazil and it is expected to post 1991 earnings of $11
million.
   WestLB is the state-controlled central banking
organization for the German savings and loan industry in the
state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Beacuse of the limited room
for growth inside Germany due to the fact that it serves just
one of Germany's 16 regional states, WestLB has been
expanding broadly in foreign markets.
