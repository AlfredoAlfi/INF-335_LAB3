Letters to the Editor:
   Legal Aid Lawyers
   Underpaid and Unsung
Most Legal Aid offices are so overwhelmed by requests for
services that only the most meritorious claims are pursued.
By their conduct, these clients and the lawyers who help them
demonstrate that they share the belief that these problems
ought to be addressed through the proper legal process rather
than through illegal or violent means. Your newspaper would
do well to applaud such conduct and recognize the important
contributions and financial sacrifices being made by the
attorneys involved.
