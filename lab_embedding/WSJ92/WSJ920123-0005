   Japan Agrees to Curb
   Anticompetitiveness
   In Computer Industry
Mrs. Hills said that if U.S. industry estimates hold true,
U.S. sales in that hard-to-crack market could rapidly expand
to $3.5 billion to $5.5 billion by 1995. Currently, the sales
of U.S. vendors to Japanese public agencies averages $500
million a year.
   The agreement bars Japanese suppliers from entering
unreasonably low bids with the intention of preventing
foreign vendors from landing government contracts. Japanese
companies also will be disqualified from bidding if they take
part in drafting the tender specifications. The agreement
also provides for clearer bidding procedures.
   Unlike Japan's unofficial pledges to increase its
purchases of U.S. cars and auto parts, the computer agreement
is a "binding" one between the two governments, Mrs. Hills
said. "We would immediately file a trade action if there were
a problem," she added.
   The accord will take effect on April 1 for measures
relating to computers and on Oct. 1 and April 1, 1993 for
various categories of computer services. U.S. industry
analysts estimate the Japanese public-sector market to be $9
billion a year. And they forecast that by 1995, that market
could generate as much as $15.8 billion in sales.
