Import-Duty Query
   Leads to U.S. Probe
   Of Millfeld's Ex-Aides
Millfeld, which imports most of its footwear from China,
said the U.S. attorney's office in New York is investigating
activities of certain former employees, who weren't named, in
connection with a duty underpayment. The investigation is in
addition to the previously disclosed audit by the Customs
Service. Last September, Millfeld took a $1.6 million charge
to cover a payment to customs after its own internal audit
determined it had underpaid duties on imports since 1986.
That prompted the customs audit.
   At the time, Barry Feldstein, president and chief
executive officer, agreed to indemnify the company for all
customs duties owed as a result of the audit.
   Millfeld said yesterday that it is cooperating in both
investigations. If customs finds that significantly more
duties are owed and interest and penalties are assessed, the
company might not have money to pay, and Mr. Feldstein may
not be able to fully indemnify, Millfeld warned.
   Mr. Feldstein has been suspended pending the outcome of
the investigation. Neil Cole, president and chief executive
of New Retail Concepts Inc., was named interim president and
chief executive. Mr. Cole also becomes a director.
   Millfeld officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
