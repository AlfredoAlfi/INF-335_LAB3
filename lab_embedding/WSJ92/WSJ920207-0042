Business Brief -- Fleming Cos.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Loss
   Of $21.6 Million Is Posted
In the fourth quarter of 1990, Fleming had net income of
$26.7 million, or 84 cents a share. Revenue for the period
rose 5.1% to $3.08 billion from $2.93 billion.
   The company didn't specify how many centers will be closed
but said it hopes to move toward larger, higher-volume
distribution centers such as "super centers" handling $700
million to $1 billion of wholesale sales a year.
   The fourth-quarter results also include a $9.3 million
charge related to a change in accounting for retirees'
medical benefits.
   The net loss was the company's first deficit since the
first quarter of 1986, when it also recorded a charge from an
accounting change. Without the charges, Fleming said it would
have had profit of $29 million, or 77 cents a share. The
company had 35.4 million weighted average shares outstanding
in the latest quarter, up from 30.5 million a year before.
