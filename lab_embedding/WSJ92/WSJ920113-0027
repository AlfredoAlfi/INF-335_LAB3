Business Brief -- Allied-Signal Inc.:
   Study on Lake Pollutants
   Is Set in New York State
From 1884 to 1986, Allied, which is based in Morristown,
N.J., manufactured soda ash and baking soda in a facility
near the lake at Solvay, N.Y. PTI Environmental Service Inc.,
Bellevue, Wash., will conduct the study, which Allied says it
will fund on a "pay-as-you-go" basis. The study is expected
to last more than a year.
   The agreement is subject to court approval, which will not
come until the end of a 30-day public-comment period. Allied
is not bound by the results of the study, nor has it said
that it is liable for cleaning up the lake. The agreement
stems from a 1989 lawsuit in which the state is seeking to
require Allied to pay for the lake's cleanup. It hadn't
specified how much the lake cleanup would cost. The lawsuit
continues, said company and state officials.
