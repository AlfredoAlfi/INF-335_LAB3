International Brief -- British Aerospace PLC:
   Firm to Sell DAF Stake,
   But Not in the Near Future
DAF has suffered from the overall slump in European truck
sales, which has hit the U.K. market particularly hard. DAF
was recently reported to have had a considerable loss for
1991 after posting a net loss of $102.9 million for the first
six months.
   Meanwhile, British Aerospace officials denied that a sale
of U.K. car manufacturer Rover was being considered.
   British Aerospace will shake up its commercial aircraft
business by splitting manufacturing linked to Airbus
Industrie, the European plane-making consortium, from all
other plane-manufacturing activities. This move is scheduled
to take place Feb. 1, according to a company official.
