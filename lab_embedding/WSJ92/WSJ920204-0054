U.S. to Let Cuba Collect
   Limited Cable Revenue
The New York Times first reported the administration's
action and said the gesture reflects a growing belief among
Cuban expatriates in the U.S. that increasing U.S.-Cuban
contacts could hasten the departure of Fidel Castro's regime.
The U.S. embargo, which has been in effect since the Cuban
revolution, prohibits U.S. companies from doing business with
Havana except for humanitarian reasons.
   ATT is installing a new cable to replace a system that
can no longer handle the calls between the two countries.
Currently, payments for these calls go into a bank account to
which the Cuban government is denied access. The State
Department declined to say what percentage of the revenue
Cuba will receive.
