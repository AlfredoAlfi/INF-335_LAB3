International Business Brief -- Ricoh Co.:
   Management Shake-Up Seen
   In Wake of Expected Loss
Ricoh is expecting an operating loss of 5.8 billion yen
($44.7 million) for the fiscal year ending March 31. The
company had operating profit of 17.4 billion yen a year
earlier, and as recently as November forecast operating
profit of five billion yen for the current year.
   Ricoh expects to post net income of 3.7 billion yen, down
74% from 14.4 billion yen. In November, the company forecast
net of 9.5 billion yen.
   The spokesman said Ricoh had suffered from the same
factors hurting the rest of Japan's electronics industry: the
recession and the strong yen. He also cited the growing costs
for developing next-generation copiers and fax machines.
