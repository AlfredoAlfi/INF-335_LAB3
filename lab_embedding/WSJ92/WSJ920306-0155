International:
   Paris Bourse Set to Seek
   Changes in Takeover Rules
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
French regulators and Finance Ministry officials have said
they don't want to change the rules while current takeover
bids are under way and in the courts.
   For months the French financial community has been in an
uproar over the takeover rules, whose problematic structure
has led to legal tangles and squabbles between shareholders
in the battles to acquire Au Printemps S.A., Source Perrier
S.A. and Exor S.A.
   The main problem with the two-thirds rule, originally
intended to keep takeover costs down for businesses, is that
once a buyer gets one-third of a company, it only has to buy
a portion of all the other shareholders' stakes to fulfill
ownership regulations. But once the bid is over, the target's
share price generally falls, leaving the minority
shareholders with devalued shares.
