Credit Ratings:
   United Technologies
   Debt of $2.7 Billion
   Downgraded by SP
The move reflects a recently announced charge of $1.5
billion, related to a restructuring and to environmental
reserves, which SP said reduces near-term financial
flexibility and highlights the "increasingly competitive
nature" of United Technologies' core businesses. United
Technologies' businesses serve commercial airlines as well as
building, industrial and automotive markets.
   A spokesman for United Technologies said the change was
expected. "From what I understand, this is a modest
adjustment in their assessment" of the company's
creditworthiness, he said, and it doesn't carry any impact on
United Technologies' financing or borrowing abilities. The
current rating "is very respectable," and the company's
financial condition remains strong, he said.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
United Technologies was quoted at $50.875 a share, up 12.5
cents.
