Credit Ratings
KROGER Co. (Cincinnati) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
upgraded $2.7 billion in debt of this supermarket chain,
citing expectations that the company will show continued
operating improvement. Moody's raised the rating of Kroger's
lease certificates, senior notes and industrial revenue bonds
to Ba-3 from single-B-1, and upgraded senior subordinated
debentures to single-B-1 from single-B-2. However, the rating
agency said Kroger's coverage ratios and cash flow
measurements will still reflect speculative-grade credit.
