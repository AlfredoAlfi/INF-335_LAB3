Business Brief -- Telebit Corp.:
   Computer Modem Maker
   Posts Loss for 4th Quarter
Telebit paid a total of $4.3 million in the last half of
1991, including $1.8 million in the fourth quarter, to buy
Morgan Stanley Research Ventures' 49% share in a joint
venture to develop modems. The company said its latest loss
also resulted from higher marketing costs for new products.
   For the full year, Telebit's net loss was $8.9 million, or
$1.31 a share, against net income of $4 million, or 65 cents
a share, in 1990. Annual sales were 6% higher at $44.5
million, up from $42.1 million.

   TELEBIT Corp. said it didn't mean to make an earnings
projection in Thursday's edition. "The company is working to
restore profitability but can't forecast when that will take
place," a spokesman said.
