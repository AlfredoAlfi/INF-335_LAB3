Florida Firm Shells Out
   Wall Street-Style Bonus
Mr. Ehlers out-earned the firm's chairman, Thomas A.
James. The 49-year-old Mr. James, also the newly named
chairman of the Securities Industry Association, received a
$500,000 bonus, for total pay of nearly $775,000, the proxy
says.
   "My board wanted to pay me more," Mr. James said in an
interview yesterday. But -- in words rarely uttered by
brokerage-industry executives -- he said: "I told them I was
more than well-compensated."
   Overall, pay in the securities business was higher in 1991
amid booming stock and bond markets. But Raymond James and
other regional firms -- those smaller brokers based far from
Wall Street -- typically dole out pint-size paychecks
compared with their big New York brethren.
   Now, the gap between the two "is narrowing because
regional firms' profit growth is increasing at a faster rate
than the big Wall Street firms," said Perrin Long, an analyst
at First of Michigan Corp. He added: "Relative to industrial
corporations, most of the top management at securities firms
is way overpaid."
