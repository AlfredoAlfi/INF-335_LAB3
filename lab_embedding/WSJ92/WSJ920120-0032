Business Brief -- Sparbanken Foersta AB:
   Ex-Deputy Finance Minister
   To Be Appointed Chairman
As previously reported, the current nonsocialist coalition
government will name seven new members to the banking group's
10-member board.
   The right to name board members was a condition that the
government placed when it guaranteed a 3.8 billion krona
($645.2 million) bailout loan to Sparbanken Foersta due to
the bank's massive credit losses in the fall of 1991.
