Letters to the Editor:
   Merck Never Dodged
   The Issue of High Risk
Nevertheless, in all our communications we have tried to
make it clear that the risks of failure are high. That is why
we were surprised and disappointed with the statement in your
article that we introduced our anti-AIDS compounds to human
studies 11 months ago "with great fanfare." The only press
initiative we have made to date on these compounds was a
press release issued Dec. 20, 1990. It began, "In response to
inquiries Merck today announced that it has entered two
closely related compounds into very preliminary Phase I human
studies as potential therapies for AIDS." We went on in the
brief release to say that "company officials stress that most
compounds at such an early stage of investigation fail."
