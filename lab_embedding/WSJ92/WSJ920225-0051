   Chairman and Chief
Apple, based here, and IBM, of Armonk, N.Y., began forming
Taligent last summer as part of a landmark partnership
between the two companies aimed at, among other things,
wresting away control of standards for basic
personal-computer software from Microsoft Corp. Taligent is
trying to leapfrog Microsoft by creating advanced operating
software based on what was originally an Apple project
codenamed "Pink."
   So far, practically all of Taligent's staff consists of
former "Pink" members, including Edward W. Birss, project
chief. Yesterday, Taligent said Mr. Birss, 39, would serve as
chief operating officer, a role he has been performing for
several months.
