Japan's Obayashi Wins
   Bid for Texas Physics Job
Obayashi submitted the bid with Dillingham Construction
Corp. of Pleasanton, Calif., which is 45%-owned by Shimizu
Corp., another leading Japanese construction company.
Obayashi will get 60% of the $17.8 million contract.
   When the SSC, as it is called, is completed by the end of
the century, it will permit a detailed analysis of subatomic
particles, offering new insights into basic physical
principles. Washington has been pressing Tokyo to contribute
more than $1 billion to the $8.5 billion project, but the
Japanese government so far hasn't made any promises, in part
because Japanese universities are pushing to shore up
underfunded basic research at home.
   "Our company has been doing construction business in the
U.S. for more than 10 years," an Obayashi spokesman said.
"This is just within the framework of our activities and has
nothing to do with the government's decision on this issue."
