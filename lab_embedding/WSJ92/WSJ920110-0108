Spain Suspends Sales
   Of Upjohn's Halicon
   In Strongest Dosage
The pharmaceutical concern said it will appeal Spain's and
France's decisions.
   "We don't believe this action is based on good scientific
or medical evidence," Theodore Cooper, Upjohn's chairman and
chief executive officer, said. "Halcion is a safe and
effective medication when it's used as recommended."
   Critics contend Halcion users have a higher incidence of
adverse reactions than users of other drugs in its class.
