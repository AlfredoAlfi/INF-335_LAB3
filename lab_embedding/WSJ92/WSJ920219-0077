Sony Likely to Post
   An Operating Loss
   For March 31 Year
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Analysts said the newspaper report was consistent with
their estimates, but said the company still would report a
profit on a consolidated basis. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun
reported that the yen's strength and the impact of Japan's
slowing economy on domestic sales of audio-video equipment
could leave Sony with an operating loss in excess of 10
billion yen ($78.3 million).
   A Sony spokesman Wednesday wouldn't confirm the newspaper
report. The company will release its results for the
October-December quarter Wednesday afternoon.
   The operating profit or loss category shows a company's
results in its main business line, and excludes non-operating
and extraordinary items.
   "It was clear from the interim report (for the first
fiscal half) that parent company operating profits were close
to zero anyway," said Michael Jeremy, an analyst with Baring
Securities. "And we know that subsequent conditions in the
market have gotten worse."
   The Nihon Keizai said Sony posted an operating profit of
10.2 billion yen for the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30.
