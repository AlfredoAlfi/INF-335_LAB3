   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Anfia said a total of 158,658 cars were sold in December,
up from 144,811 a year earlier. In all of 1991, car sales
totaled 2,340,260, down from 2,348,154 in 1990. Last year was
the third consecutive year that car sales in Italy topped 2.3
million units.
   Although Italy's car market was among the strongest in
Europe last year, far better than those of Britain, France
and Spain, market share of domestic manufacturers, notably
Fiat S.p.A., continued to be under pressure.
   Fiat, which produces Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo models,
controlled 45.1% of the domestic car market in December, down
from 48.5% a year earlier.
   As a result, Fiat's market share in all of 1991 plunged to
46.7% from 52.8%.
   Among foreign producers, Ford Motor Co. made the strongest
gain in market share, controlling about 9.3% in December, up
from 7.8% in December 1990. The company controlled 11.1% of
the market in 1991, compared with 7.7% in 1990.
   Volkswagen AG was No. 1 among foreign makers in December
with 12.1% of the market, edging down from 12.4% a year
earlier. The German auto company's market share for the full
year totaled 8.6%, up from 8.1% in 1990.
