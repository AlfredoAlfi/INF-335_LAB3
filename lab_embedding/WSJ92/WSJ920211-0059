Business Brief -- Anago Inc.:
   Texas Medical Goods Maker
   Files Suit Against Tecnol
Anago said Tecnol acquired its stake in Anago "in
violation of various laws and contractual obligations." Its
lawsuit claims securities law violations, antitrust
violations, wrongful disclosure of confidential information
and breach of fiduciary duty, among other things, Anago said.
Anago, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said it is seeking to
reverse the Tecnol purchase of shares.
   Tecnol last week said it believed the combination of the
two firms would be "beneficial due to the complementary
manufacturing and sales methods utilized by the two
companies."
