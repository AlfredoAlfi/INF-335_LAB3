International:
   Germany's Producer Prices
The December price movements compare with a 0.1% monthly
decline in November, when there also was a 2.5% gain from 12
months earlier. In 1990, producer prices rose an average 1.7%
over 1989 levels.
   The Statistics Office doesn't yet report on all German
producer prices; eastern German price data are reported
separately.
   The Statistics Office said its December producer price
index fell to 104.1 from 104.3 a month earlier and was up
from December 1990's level of 101.5.
   The 1991 index for the full-year average was 103.4 vs.
101.0. The index is based on 1985 price levels equaling 100.
