Business Brief -- A.P. Green Industries Inc.:
   Production Cuts, Layoffs
   Are Set for Three Plants
A.P. Green said the cutbacks at three of its seven U.S.
refractory plants reflect the "continuing impact of the
recession on major consumers" of its refractory products,
such as steel and glass companies.
   A spokesman said the number of employees the company calls
back depends on "business conditions." In addition, a small
number of salaried manufacturing jobs will be eliminated, he
said. The company employs 952 hourly workers and 469 salaried
workers in the U.S.
   "We do not anticipate meaningful increases in demand for
our refractory products during the first quarter of 1992,"
said Paul F. Hummer, president and chief operating officer.
"If our order backlog declines further, more layoffs can be
anticipated as we continue to adjust our production schedules
to customer demand."
   The spokesman said the company would take only an
"insignificant, if any" charge to cover the cutbacks.
