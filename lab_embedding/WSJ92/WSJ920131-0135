Canada Phone Firms
   And Spar Aerospace
   Will Bid on Telesat
The 10 telephone companies involved in the joint bid
already own 41.6% of Telesat's shares. They include Bell
Canada, the country's largest telephone company, which is a
subsidiary of BCE Inc., a Montreal holding company. Spar
Aerospace is a Toronto producer of communications satellites
and other aerospace equipment.
   A spokesman for the group declined to indicate the value
of its planned offer for the Telesat shares.
   No other group has announced a bid for the government's
Telesat interest. Yesterday was the deadline for potential
bidders to announce their intentions.
   Telesat, which operates six communications satellites and
about 500 earth stations, had a net profit of 30.4 million
Canadian dollars (US$25.9 million) in 1990 on revenue of
C$177.8 million.
