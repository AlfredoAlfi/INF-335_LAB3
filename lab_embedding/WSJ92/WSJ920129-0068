   Future NutraSweet Rival
   Won't Require Use of Logo
Major users expect the entry of Holland, and perhaps
others, into the U.S. market will drive down the price.
Industry sources estimate aspartame now costs about $55 a
pound in the U.S.
   Holland, a joint venture of chemical makers DSM N.V. of
Heerlen and Tosoh Corp. of Tokyo, said it will quadruple
capacity at its aspartame plant in Europe in preparation for
the opening of the U.S. market.
   Responding to Holland's announcement, NutraSweet, a unit
of Monsanto Co., said it welcomes competition and is
"confident that we will remain the sweetener supplier of
choice for food and beverage companies" in the U.S.
NutraSweet said it "will continue to be the low-cost producer
of aspartame."
