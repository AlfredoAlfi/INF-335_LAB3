Ferro Talks With ICI
In August, the two companies announced an agreement to
form the joint venture, which was to have manufacturing sites
in 10 countries and expected sales of $200 million. Ferro,
which makes industrial specialty materials, was to have a 49%
equity interest; the company said negotiations broke down
because it didn't feel its minority interest would be
protected.
