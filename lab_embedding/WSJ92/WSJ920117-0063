First Bank System
   Agrees to Swap Stock
   For Bank Shares Inc.
First Bank shares were quoted late yesterday at $26.375 in
New York Stock Exchange trading, giving the proposed
transaction an indicated current value of $247.9 million.
   As a result of the planned purchase, First Bank said, Mr.
Pohlad "will become one of FBS's largest shareholders." The
company currently has 78.4 million shares outstanding,
suggesting that Mr. Pohlad will control a First Bank stake of
about 10.7%. A First Bank spokeswoman said Mr. Pohlad will be
offered a board seat, although it hasn't "been determined if
he'll accept."
   The letter of intent between the two companies is subject
to a definitive purchase agreement, as well as approval by
regulators. First Bank said it expects to close the
transaction this year.
   Mr. Pohlad's stake in First Bank would be second only to
that held by Corporate Partners, a fund managed by Lazard
Freres  Co. Corporate Partners currently holds 13.4% of
First Bank.
   Bank Shares has $2.2 billion of assets in its flagship
Marquette Bank Minneapolis. Its Marquette Bank Rochester,
also in Minnesota, has $190 million in assets.
   First Bank, the second-largest bank holding company in the
state behind Norwest Corp., currently has assets of $18.3
billion.
