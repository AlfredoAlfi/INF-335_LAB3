Trump Organization Says
   Holders Clear Debt Plan
With a prepackaged bankruptcy, the company will enter
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, which provides
protection against creditor lawsuits, with its restructuring
plan already in place, permitting a speedy exit from
bankruptcy-law protection.
   Last week, Trump officials told the commission that the
organization had enough support from Trump Castle casino
bondholders to allow a prepackaged bankruptcy filing there as
well. Several people familiar with the positions of large
bondholders, however, say that one major Trump Castle
bondholder that had been counted as a supporter had attached
conditions to its vote that Trump officials had yet to meet.
   Nicholas Ribis, chief executive officer of Trump's
Atlantic City properties, declined to discuss the matter,
asserting that Trump Castle "already has sufficient
affirmative votes" to make the prepackaged filing.
