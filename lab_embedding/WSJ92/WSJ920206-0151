Business Brief:
   Datamarine Holders
   Support 2 Directors,
   Stock-Option Plan
In addition, the plan was modified to increase the
exercise price of future options granted in the plan to at
least 80% of the fair market value of Datamarine stock at the
time they are granted. As originally proposed, the exercise
price of some of the options was discretionary to the board
of this maker of marine instruments.
   Re-elected to the four-member board were David Thompson,
chief operating officer of Datamarine and president of its
SEA unit, and David M. Brown, Datamarine chairman.
   Howard H. Hill, founder and former chairman of the company
and holder of about 9% of its stock, who had urged
shareholders to reject the nominated directors and turn down
the proposed stock-option plan, described the outcome as a
"mild victory."
