Business Brief -- Banco Exterior de Espana:
   State Bank to Raise Stake
   In Steel Company Acenor
The bonds, originally held by state industrial bank Banco
de Credito Industrial, were taken over by Banco Exterior when
the government merged its five state-held banks last year.
The acquisition comes as part of a restructuring plan for
Acenor, which posted losses of 9.43 billion pesetas in 1990
and is estimating that losses reached 14 billion pesetas in
1991.
   The steel company also plans to shut two of its factories
in the northeastern Catalonia region and lay off 1,845
workers.
