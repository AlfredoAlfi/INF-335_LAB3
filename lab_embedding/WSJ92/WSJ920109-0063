Potlatch, Simpson
   Unit Settle Civil Suit
   Charging Pollution
Potlatch operated a paper mill in Pomona, Calif., from
1952 to 1979, when it was sold to San Francisco's Simpson
Paper Co., a unit of Simpson Investment Co., Seattle. The
mill, which recycled waste paper, was alleged to be a source
of PCBs.
   Under the consent decree, which is subject to court
approval, Potlatch will pay $9.5 million and Simpson will pay
$2.5 million over four years. Potlatch said it has brought an
action for declaratory relief to recover the settlement
amount from its insurance carriers.
