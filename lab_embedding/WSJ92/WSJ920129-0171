REVIEW  OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   `We've Been Robbed'
"We have been robbed," a Moscow spokesman for the group
told the U.N. Staff Report in Moscow. (Included in their
numbers is the widow of Victor Leslovsky, whom many suspected
as having been KGB station chief at the U.N.) "No other
totalitarian regime has ever gone to so cynical a robbery of
its loyal and patriotically minded citizens," complained a
litigant. Who could argue with that?
   Reached by phone, the U.N. Pension Fund said it had heard
nothing about a lawsuit as yet. The plaintiffs reportedly
plan to take their case to the International Court of Justice
but they oughtn't rule out the U.S. as a venue. We have
watched many American courts hear sillier cases than this
one. The retirees have also found in the $9 billion U.N.
Pension Fund the first requisite for such a suit: a fat
target.
