Technology Brief -- Xoma Corp.:
   Concern's Patent Is Upheld
   Against Centocor's Claims
Xoma, based in Berkeley, Calif., filed suit against
Centocor in April 1990 for infringement of its patent
covering the use of the antibodies targeted precisely against
endotoxin, a lethal poison released in the body during an
overwhelming bacterial blood infection known as gram-negative
sepsis. About 400,000 people a year are believed to suffer
from the condition.
   As reported, in December, a judge ruled Centocor must make
payments to Xoma, but denied a hearing sought by Xoma to bar
Centocor from the market.
   Despite its patent setback, Centocor's product Centoxin
already has received a recommendation of market approval by a
panel of the Food and Drug Administration. Xoma's competing
product, known as E5, has yet to get such a recommendation.
   A spokesman for Centocor, Malvern, Pa., said the company
plans to appeal the case to the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., once the District Court
judgment is entered.
