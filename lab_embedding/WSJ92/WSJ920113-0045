Technology Brief -- Trimedyne Inc.:
   Firm Gets FDA Clearance
   To Sell Back-Pain Device
On the news, the company's stock rose on over-the-counter
trading Friday to $8.625, up $2.25.
   Lower back pain afflicts about 20 million Americans, and
the standard procedure until now has been surgery to remove
swollen tissue in the back's disks. The Trimedyne device
instead uses a needle to puncture the disk and transmit laser
energy that vaporizes swollen tissue, thus relieving the
pain, Mr. Atchison said. He added that the procedure is less
expensive because it requires less hospital and recuperation
time than conventional disk surgery.
