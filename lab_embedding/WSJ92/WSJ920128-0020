Asbestos-Stake Plan
   Won't Affect Action
   By Holders, Aide Says
Clarifying a cryptic statement issued Friday evening,
Benoit Cartier, president of Societe nationale de l'amiante,
a provincial agency, said that if Asbestos minority
shareholders ultimately succeed in getting a court or
securities regulators to order a follow-up offer for their
shares, Quebec will remain responsible for paying for any
such offer, rather than any new owner of the government's
majority interest.
   Quebec quietly invited bids last month for 100%-owned Bell
Asbestos Mines Ltd. and the government's stake in Asbestos
Corp. In a transaction completed in 1986, Quebec paid U.S.
aerospace concern General Dynamics Corp. about C$170 million
for the Asbestos stake.
   Mr. Cartier, who is also chairman and acting chief
executive officer of Asbestos, said the government has
received more than two offers for the stake in Asbestos Corp.
He declined to say if the Asbestos Corp. stake and Bell
Asbestos Mines are being sold as a package.
   On the Montreal Exchange, Asbestos Corp. stock closed at
C$12, up C$3.50, on volume of just 800 shares.
