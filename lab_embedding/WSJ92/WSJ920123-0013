Business Brief -- Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd.:
   Capital Management Unit,
   Wako Operation to Merge
Japanese banks, currently prohibited from underwriting
securities, are expected to be allowed into the securities
business in coming years. It's thought that banks will be
forced to absorb some of Japan's troubled middle-tier brokers
as a government condition for entry into the business.
   Wako, which is 4.7%-owned by IBJ, is heavily dependent on
retail commission income, and like other brokerage firms has
been hit by low trading volume on the Tokyo stock market.
   The merger, which is subject to government approval, will
create a company with combined capital of 300 million yen
($2.4 million) that will control about 950 billion yen of
assets, an IBJ official said.
   IBJ's group will own 67% of IBJW, and the current
president and chief executive of IBJ Capital Management will
assume those roles at IBJW.
