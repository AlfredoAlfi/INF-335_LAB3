Who's News:
   Quantum Corp. Picks
   Control Data's Miller
   To Be Chief Executive
"We haven't expanded the management team commensurate with
the growth we've had," said a spokeswoman, noting that the
company's annual sales have increased to more than $1 billion
from $100 million in five years. She said the change will
allow Mr. Berkley, 47, a chance to "step back from the hectic
pace of day-to-day management and take the time to breathe."
   Todd Bakar, an analyst with San Francisco investment bank
Hambrecht  Quist, called the appointment a coup for Quantum
because Mr. Miller is widely respected in the industry. He
said Mr. Miller's management skills will give Mr. Berkley
time to "focus on strategic relationships and other new
business opportunities."
