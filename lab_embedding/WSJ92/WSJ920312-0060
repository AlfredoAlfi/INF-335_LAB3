   Show 68.4% Had 1991 Loss
Dr. Bjorn Hanson, chairman of the firm's
hospitality-industry consulting group, predicted that 1992
losses would ease to 1990 levels.
   Dr. Hanson attributed the losses to excessive debt
incurred by the industry in the 1980s, coupled with the
recession. He said that the industry would benefit from the
restructuring of $3 billion in debt last year, the reduction
of operating expenses and an expected decline in total rooms
this year.
   Hotels had losses of roughly $1,700 per available room in
1991, up from $1,600 in 1990, according to the firm, which
forecast 1992 losses of $1,550.
