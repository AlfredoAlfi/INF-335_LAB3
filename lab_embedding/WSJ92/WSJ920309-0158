Travelers Corp. Is Set
   To Place Senior Notes
   Totaling $300 Million
Analysts said the offering, which is being sold privately
to institutional investors, will probably allow Travelers to
put capital into its life insurance unit, Travelers Insurance
Co., which needs money because of losses on its real estate
portfolio.
   Such an infusion would follow a $168 million contribution
from Travelers to the life insurance unit during the fourth
quarter, which allowed it to show an increase in surplus of
$37.6 million. Without the infusion, the life insurance
company's surplus would have declined. Surplus is an
insurance company's equivalent of net worth and serves as a
cushion for policyholders against losses.
   In a recent quarterly filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Travelers said it is seeking to raise
capital by selling a stake to investors or selling certain of
its businesses.
   Analysts say the capital Travelers raises through the
private placement probably won't be enough to solve its
problems, however, which have grown out of several years of
losses on its real estate portfolio. "This is an ongoing
process," said an analyst with Conning  Co., a Hartford
research firm.
