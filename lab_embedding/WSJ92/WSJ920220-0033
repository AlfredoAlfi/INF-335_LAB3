International Brief -- Rhone-Poulenc S.A.:
   Group Net Climbed 3.2%
   In 1991 on 6.9% Sales Rise
Despite expectations that the global economy won't see a
significant recovery this year, Mr. Fourtou said: "We believe
that our operating income will increase by at least 20% in
both 1992 and 1993." A major force behind this growth is
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the U.S. pharmaceutical company acquired
in late 1989. In 1991, the first full year with Rorer sales
consolidated into the company, operating income in the health
sector soared to 4.2 billion French francs from 2 billion
francs. Without Rorer's contribution, that sector would have
grown only 13%, the company said.
