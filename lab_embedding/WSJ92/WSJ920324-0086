Men's neckties vary greatly in width
   According to fashion's dictates;
   The dimensions of a man's neckwear
   Determine, they say, how one rates.
   One advantage of advancing age
   That one can point to with pride:
   We accumulate a drawerful of ties
   From two to six inches wide.

   Analyzing personalities
   Is often exceedingly tough.
   For instance, I'm told:
   "You're too much]"
   When I know that I'm not enough.
   -- Arnold J. Zarett.
