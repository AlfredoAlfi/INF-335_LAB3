Letters to the Editor:
   Making Up the Rules
   As the Game Is Played
Team Four knows that most restrictive visions are
uneconomical and that even the most utterly team-specific
task can be rethought. So it secures the best form of
activity, knowing also that its environment is more demanding
and less forgiving, but at the same time richer in
possibilities.
