Business Brief -- Ground Round Restaurants Inc.:
   Firm Sees Quarter's Profit
   Meeting Analyst Estimates
Ground Round, a Braintree, Mass., restaurant chain that
made an initial public offering last year, said it has no
comparable results for the year-earlier period. For the
quarter ended Sept. 29, Ground Round had a loss of $1.7
million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $54.9 million.
   Mr. O'Donnell said its new promotion, where a child's meal
costs in pennies what the temperature is outside, is one of
Ground Round's most successful promotions. A similar
promotion, where a child's meal costs in pennies what a child
weighs in pounds, has also helped sales, he said.
   Ground Round, which operates 200 restaurants, said it
hopes to open about 20 new restaurants this year. It hopes to
add 70 to 90 new sites by 1997.
