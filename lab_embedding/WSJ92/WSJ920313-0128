Western Germany's
   January Retail Sales
   Eased on Real Estate
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
January not only was the third straight month of real
sales declines, but the drop that month was the largest since
the 1.7% decrease in August 1991.
   Moreover, sales of the large western German department
store chains were down a nominal 1% in January from a year
earlier, although big mail-order houses showed a 16% rise.
The agency doesn't report sales for chain stores on a
price-adjusted basis.
   In December, western German retail sales were down 0.5% in
real terms and up a nominal 2.3%. In all of 1991, however,
sales were up a real 5.6% and were a nominal 8.6% higher.
   The Statistics Office reports western and eastern Germany
sales data separately.
