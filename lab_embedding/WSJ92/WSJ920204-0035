Business Brief -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp.:
   Company Is Recalling Cars
   To Fix Emissions Systems
The repair is free to owners, who should be prepared to
leave their cars with dealers for a full day. The company
will replace the cars' catalytic converters with new ones
that will result in lower carbon monoxide emissions.
   Mitsubishi began notifying owners last week. Chrysler
owners will be notified in about two months.
