Tucson Electric Sells
   Its Stake in Foothill
Henry K. Jordan, vice president and chief financial
officer of Foothill Group, said the sale was made to a number
of institutional and individual investors. Mr. Jordan said
that he didn't know the identities of all the buyers but that
none would now hold more than 9.9% of Foothill stock,
although some might own more than a 5% stake.
   Foothill Group, based in Agoura Hills, Calif., is a
commercial lending and leasing concern. Its stock closed
Friday at $5.75 a share, up 62.5 cents.
   Tucson Electric, which earlier last week won federal court
dismissal of creditors' efforts to have it put into
involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, is attempting to sell its
non-utility holdings. Tucson Electric stock closed Friday at
$5.125 a share, off 37.5 cents, in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Tucson Electric acquired the stake in Foothill Group
between 1986 and 1988 for a total of $29.8 million,
indicating a loss of about $10.5 million on the sale before
transaction costs. A company official said provision for the
loss is included in an $85 million reserve established in
1990 for discontinuance of non-utility operations.
