Letters to the Editor:
   Kicked Us When We're
   Down, but Getting Up
Instead, you virtually ignored our work of the past five
years, and simply killed off as a head-chopping exercise the
vast effort at Union Carbide to improve our operations
permanently. Although any number is a guess until we see the
results of work simplification, your reporting of 2,000 to
3,000 more job reductions after the spinoff is at least
double our own estimate.
   Though, as I noted to your reporter, distribution costs in
some of our businesses are too high, the polyethylene
business isn't one of them. Our costs are fully competitive
with polyethylene-industry average costs, and we are rapidly
bringing down distribution costs in our other businesses.
   As for the takeover speculation you report, it's totally
unrealistic today.
   Your thesis that Bhopal and GAF were "defining events" for
Union Carbide is correct, whatever that adds to anyone's
understanding of the past five years at our company. How
could they be otherwise? I am just dismayed and angry that
the piece was so intent on showing that Bhopal and the
aftermath did us in. It very deliberately ignored anything
that might suggest we had moved beyond those events.
