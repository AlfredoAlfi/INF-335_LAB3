International:
   Ex-Soviet Gas Monopoly
   May Get Foreign Investors
Tass said as much as 815 billion cubic meters of gas is
extracted annually on the territory of the commonwealth.
   Gasprom provided most of the natural gas used in the
Soviet Union, and has continued to operate since the
country's breakup into separate republics. It draws supplies
from gas deposits in western Siberia, Komi, the Orenburg
region, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and the Caspian area.
   Tass said total reserves are estimated at "more than 30
trillion cubic meters of gas," adding that western Siberia
accounts for over 60% of them. The delivery system contains
134,000 miles of trunk pipelines, Tass said.
