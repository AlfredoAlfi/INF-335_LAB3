The 69-year-old sign, high in the Hollywood Hills, is one
of the best-known civic symbols in the world. The Walk of
Fame features hundreds of sidewalk plaques on Hollywood
Boulevard honoring entertainment personalities.
   Chamber officials said they didn't know how much licensing
revenue is generated annually from souvenirs, film and
commercials. But an attorney for the chamber, Jeffrey Briggs
of the law firm of Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher, said "the feeling
of the chamber is that {the landmarks} are underexploited."
Estimates of revenue from the rights range from $20,000 to
$100,000 a year, and officials also said the efficiency of
collection broke down since the attorney general's office
began investigating nearly three years ago.
   The settlement provides that the city use the symbols for
official, noncommercial purposes.
