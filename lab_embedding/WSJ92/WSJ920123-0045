Business Brief -- Neiman Marcus Group Inc.:
   Sales Outlook Is Cautious
   For First Half of This Year
Unlike other recessions, Mr. Tarr noted, this downturn has
struck the white-collar and professional ranks, which
constitute the retailer's core customers at its Neiman Marcus
and Bergdorf Goodman stores. Neiman Marcus, based in Newton,
Mass., also operates Contempo Casuals, a retail chain that
caters to younger shoppers.
   The soft retail environment, now entering its fourth year,
is expected to continue through the spring, he added. As a
result, Mr. Tarr characterized as "cautious" the company's
outlook for its spring selling season, from February to July.
The projected recessionary market would affect the company's
fiscal third quarter ending May 4 and fourth quarter ending
Aug. 3, a company spokesman added.
   However, industry projections call for an improvement in
the retail business beginning in September, and the company,
which has remodeled many of its stores, ought to be
well-positioned to gain from such a turn in the economy, said
Mr. Tarr.
