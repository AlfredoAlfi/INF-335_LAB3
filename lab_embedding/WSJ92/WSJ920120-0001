Newmark  Lewis
   Begins Liquidating
   Assets; Market Cited
Newmark  Lewis also said it consented to the delisting of
its common stock on the American Stock Exchange and announced
the last day of trading for the shares as Jan. 24. It added
that a market for the stock may develop over the counter,
although there can be no assurance of such a development. The
liquidation wasn't expected to result in any recovery for
shareholders.
   Newmark  Lewis had been one of the largest appliance and
consumer electronic retailers in the competitive New York
market. But the company was badly hurt by an aggressive
acquisition effort in New Jersey, just as the local economy
was beginning to sour. After it filed for bankruptcy, Newmark
 Lewis tried to turn around the bottom line by reducing its
operations to 14 stores, and earlier this month, announced
its intention to find a major investor or buyer for the
chain.
   But the company's final attempts to stave off liquidation
collapsed quickly. "I guess nobody was interested," said
Terrence McEvoy, retailing analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc., who believes that only a handful of other local
electronic retailers could have been prospective buyers.
"It's a pretty limited universe. . . ."
