   California Bond Sale:
   Right Time, Right Place
Mr. Ferguson's counsel might have been more appropriate if
California did not have in place a Bond Sales Management
Plan. This road map to reducing our sizable bond backlog,
which was devised since I took office last year, takes into
account a variety of different factors that determine the
size and timing of all California bond sales. Chief among
those factors are supply-and-demand conditions, which
currently are extremely favorable to California.
