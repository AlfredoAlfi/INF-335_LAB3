Business Brief -- Becton Dickinson Co.:
   Drop in Net Income of 26%
   Posted for Fiscal 1st Period
The company also attributed the decline to the continuing
effect of price reductions in Brazil in anticipation of the
lowering of trade barriers. Becton Dickinson said the move
will help the company gain market share in the long term.
   Becton predicted sales would grow at a faster rate for the
balance of the year, particularly in the second half.
Earnings growth is expected to resume in the second quarter,
while earnings for the year, excluding foreign currency
effects, are expected to grow at 10%.
   Becton's shares were quoted yesterday at $68.75, up 75
cents apiece, in late New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
