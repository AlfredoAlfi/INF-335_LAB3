   Gensia, Sandoz Unit
   In Development Pact
Under the agreement, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, the East
Hanover, N.J., unit of Switzerland's Sandoz Ltd., will fund
basic research at Gensia to develop compounds that regulate
blood glucose production. Gensia, a San Diego biotechnology
company that is also developing drugs for heart disease, said
it will receive milestone payments as drugs are developed. It
expects payments of about $22 million if one drug is
developed, the company said.
   Sandoz, which will be responsible for clinical
development, regulatory filings, manufacturing and marketing
of any drug licensed, will have the right to an exclusive
world-wide license to diabetes drugs discovered during the
agreement. Gensia, however, has an option to co-promote any
drug in the U.S. and Canada and will receive royalties on
sales in areas where it chooses not to co-promote a drug.
