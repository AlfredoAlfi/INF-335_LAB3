Pepper...and Salt
Nor snow, nor rain, nor gloom of night,
   Nor winter's cruel ices
   Can stay the Postal Service from
   Increasing its stamp prices.

   Please, No Politeness
                                                                                                       

   That I must be aging quickly
   Is all I can infer,
   When folks who used to call me "Sonny"
   Now refer to me as "Sir."
