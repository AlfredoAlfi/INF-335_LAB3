California Fund Raises
   Its Planned Investment
   In Homebuilding
The California pension fund first announced last month
that it would invest $225 million in single-family
home-building, with money made available for builders on a
select basis, and yesterday decided to kick in an additional
$150 million. Pension fund administrators envision that the
home-building program would generate around 3,800 new homes
over the next 18 months.
