Cost of Living in Chile Falls 0.6%
The government's National Statistics Institute said the
fall in February was due mainly to seasonal factors and a
drop in the prices of some fruits and vegetables. It was the
best inflation performance in Chile in a decade, it said.
   Chile had an inflation rate of 18.7% in 1991, and the
government has set a goal of 15% for this year.
