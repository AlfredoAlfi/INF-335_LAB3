Marketing  Media:
   Orion Expected to Unveil
   Revised New Line Proposal
Under the original proposal, New York-based New Line, an
independent film maker and distributor, would have owned
49.5% of a reorganized Orion, and Orion bondholders would
have held 41.5%. The current 70% stake held by Metromedia Co.
would have been reduced to 7.5% with an option to buy a 2.5%
stake from New Line. How the proposed stakes may change
couldn't be learned.
   Officials from New Line, Orion and Orion's bondholder
committee wouldn't comment, pending an announcement this
morning.
   Orion, based in New York and Los Angeles, filed for
Chapter 11 Dec. 11, listing assets of $1.1 billion and
liabilities of $973 million. This month it fired 60
employees, paring its staff to about 420 from 675 a year ago.
   The proposal needs the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy
court. But the door may remain open to other bidders. Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. has considered making a bid for
Orion to get hold of its vast movie library for the company's
cable channels. Turner declined comment.
