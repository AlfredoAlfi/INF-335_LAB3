Who's News:
   Stanley Hiller to Take
   Senior Key Tronic Post
Key Tronic said the Hiller Group's option would be for a
price above the current market price, would be fully vested
after two years and could be exercised for five years. The
company also said the Hiller group had entered into an option
agreement with the family company of founder L.G. Zirkle, its
single largest shareholder, but declined to elaborate.
   Key Tronic, which operates facilities in Washington state,
Dundalk, Ireland, and Hsinchu, Taiwan, has been returning to
its core keyboard business after a diversification attempt
that included the unsuccessful development of a computer
notebook product.
