Business Brief -- PPG Industries Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Income
   Fell 69% to $31.5 Million
The bad news was expected, but in recent weeks, PPG's
share price has risen almost $10 to the mid $50s, as
investors expect an improved economy this year will drive up
PPG's profits. PPG said that while a modest recovery seems
likely in 1992, it expects a slow first half.
   The recent upward trend continued yesterday, as PPG gained
$1.375 to $57.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
