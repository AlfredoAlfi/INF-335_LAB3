Campeau Proposal
   Is Facing Challenge
   On Reichmann's Role
The Reichmanns, whose Olympia  York Developments Ltd.
holding company is Campeau's biggest creditor, would end up
holding 66% of the company's stock. The plan also would
release Olympia  York from potential legal liabilities to
Campeau, a real estate concern based here.
   In his claim, Patrick Kelly, who was appointed by Mr.
Campeau to the Campeau board, is seeking to obtain a copy of
a legal report from last year on whether Olympia  York
breached certain obligations allegedly contained in a
September 1989 agreement. Under that agreement Olympia  York
bailed out Campeau with a $250 million loan in exchange for
liens on much of the company's assets.
   "The corporation does not believe there have been any
grounds to sue Olympia  York. To raise this at this point, I
can't begin to explain what the man's {Mr. Kelly's} agenda is
other than to derail the {restructuring} plan," said Campeau
spokesman Richard Wertheim.
