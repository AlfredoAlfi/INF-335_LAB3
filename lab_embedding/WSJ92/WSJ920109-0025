Marketing  Media Brief -- Grand Metropolitan PLC:
   Pillsbury Co. Unit to Buy
   Unit of McGlynn Bakeries
McGlynn's frozen products division manufactures and
markets a line of frozen dough, batter and frozen pre-baked
products, danish and puff pastries, muffins and cookies. The
frozen products division represents about two-thirds of
McGlynn's $180 million in annual sales. The transaction
doesn't include McGlynn's retail bakery opertions or its cake
decorating supply business.
   Grand Met said the acquisition will complement Pillsbury's
baked goods businesses, where it is already a leading
provider of baking and other products to food-service and
bakery outlets.
   The company said it expects that completion of the
purchase, which is subject to U.S. legal and regulatory
approval, will take place during February.
