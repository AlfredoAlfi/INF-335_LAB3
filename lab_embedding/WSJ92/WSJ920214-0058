Kaufman  Broad
   Files to Offer `Special'
   Class of Its Common
Kaufman  Broad said it would receive about $52.2 million
from exercise of the warrants. Sun Life would receive gross
proceeds equal to the difference between the selling price of
the new shares, minus payment of the warrants' exercise price
of $6.96 each.
   The warrant sale and stock offering will enable Kaufman 
Broad and Sun Life to raise capital, said R. Chad Dreier,
Kaufman  Broad senior vice president and chief financial
officer. The new Kaufman  Broad shares are expected to trade
at about the same price as the existing common shares, he
said.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kaufman  Broad Home shares closed at $24.375, off
50 cents.
   The offering will be managed by Smith Barney, Harris Upham
 Co., Lazard Freres  Co., Montgomery Securities and
Oppenheimer  Co. About 5.1 million shares will be offered in
the U.S. and the rest abroad. Underwriters have an option to
acquire an additional 900,000 shares. Kaufman  Broad said it
will seek to list the shares on the Big Board.
