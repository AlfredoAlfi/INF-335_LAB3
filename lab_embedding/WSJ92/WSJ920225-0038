Venezuela Eurobond
   Rating Is Affirmed
The rating reflects the country's improving economic
performance since 1989 and its continuing commitment to a
far-reaching stabilization program. Since the implementation
in 1989 of an economic reform program, the Venezuelan economy
has grown rapidly, SP noted.
   While the attempted coup on Feb. 4 wasn't rooted in a
broadly based popular movement, the absence of a public
outcry against it has highlighted the electorate's
disaffection with the political system, the analysis said.
   The government's proposed social spending program should
have a modest budgetary impact, SP said, and investment
outlays largely will be financed by privatization proceeds.
