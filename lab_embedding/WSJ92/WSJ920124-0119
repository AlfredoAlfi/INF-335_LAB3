International:
   Lithuania Distances Itself
   From Soviet Debt Accord
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
"Lithuania doesn't offer itself as a successor to the
rights and obligations of the U.S.S.R.," Mr. Landsbergis
said, noting that his nation was independent until its
annexation by Moscow after World War II.
   Mr. Landsbergis argued that Lithuania shouldn't be
responsible for Soviet debts because they were largely
created by Moscow's military and political initiatives, such
as the war in Afghanistan and expansion of nuclear
capabilities.
   The Group of Seven major industrialized nations have
agreed to waive $3.2 billion of principal payments on
official debts due this year from the former Soviet Union.
Eleven of the 15 former Soviet republics have signed a letter
of intent committing to the G-7's conditions on debt
suspension. The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia are among the four that didn't sign the letter of
intent.
   Soviet debt is estimated to total between $65 billion and
$81 billion.
