California Farmers Likely
   To Get a Break on Water
Certain other customers, who have water rights that
predate the construction of the water project, will get 75%
of their water allotments this year. The bureau had expected
to ship them only about 50% of their water this year.
   Recent heavy storms have added about one million acre feet
of water to the project's system of reservoirs, although they
haven't broken the drought in most of the state. In a normal
year, the project delivers more than seven million acre feet
of water; this year deliveries, even with the increases, are
expected to be less than half that.
