International:
   Soviet Scientists Sign Pact
   To Help Sun Microsystems
Continuing to work in Moscow, Mr. Babayan and 50
associates at the Institute for Precision Mechanics 
Computing Equipment are expected to help Sun improve
computational abilitites of its microprocessors.
   Although the computer company said it was providing an
unspecified level of funding and equipment to the scientists
under a long-term agreement, Sun didn't provide financial
details. A spokeswoman said a report that each of the
scientists would be paid a little more than their current
salaries of a few hundred dollars a year in U.S. dollars was
"low"; however, she declined to specify exactly how much they
would earn. She said the scientists would continue to receive
their current salaries from the institute in Moscow, in
addition to grants under the new cooperative pact.
