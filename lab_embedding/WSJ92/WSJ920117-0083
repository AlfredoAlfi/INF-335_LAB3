Credit Ratings
TRANSAMERICA Corp. (San Francisco) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. assigned an "A-2" rating to Transamerica's $150
million of Series D preferred stock. The ratings agency cited
Transamerica's mix of profitable insurance and consumer
lending operations, which have been weighed down somewhat by
its high leverage and poor performance in commercial lending,
among other things.
