Business Brief -- Nevada Power Co.:
   Agency Delays Reduction
   In Rate Planned for March
The commission's latest action "will have a positive
effect on our cash flow situation which has been drained by
the heavy construction demands of the last two years," said
Charles A. Lenzie, chairman and chief executive officer.
"This, coupled with adequate general rate relief this summer
will help ease some of the financial strain we've been
under."
   Nevada Power, the state's largest utility, filed Jan. 29
for a 6.7% average rate increase, equal to about $38.7
million of annual revenue, to recover operating and
maintenance expenses and investment in new facilities. Citing
mounting financial pressure, the utility asked the commission
to implement the increase within 30 days. Two weeks earlier,
the utility had filed for the rate reduction, equal to about
$26.7 million of annual revenue, related to lower fuel and
purchase power costs.
   Nevada Power was quoted at $19 a share, off 12.5 cents, in
late New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
