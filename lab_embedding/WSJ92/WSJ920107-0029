Business Brief -- Immunex Corp.:
   Firm Says R&D Spending
   Will Temper '92 Earnings
Mr. Kranda said Immunex more than met its goal of breaking
even in 1991, and expects to announce a modest profit for the
fourth quarter and the full year. He didn't elaborate, but
most analysts have been expecting the company to report
earnings of about $500,000, or four cents a share, for 1991.
Final results are due in February.
   Mr. Kranda said Immunex plans to increase R&D spending by
50% to about $45 million in 1992, focusing on clinical
development of its blood-cell growth factors and its receptor
products to treat inflammation and wasting.
   That investment will depress 1992 earnings per share below
the current consensus estimates by Wall Street analysts, the
executive said. Those forecasts average about 85 cents a
share, with some ranging as high as $2.50 a share.
