U.S. Agrees to Give
   $50 Million for Fund
   On Global Warming
The move also provides a new indication that the U.S. is
serious about trying to seek an agreement on a treaty that
would call for a stabilization of greenhouse gasses. Many
scientists believe that the buildup of these gasses threatens
to cause a disastrous warming of the Earth's climate. The
U.S. is the only major industrial nation that hasn't pledged
such a step, which is a major impediment to agreement on a
treaty.
   The money will go to the core fund of the Global
Environmental Facility, which will be affiliated with the
World Bank. The fund is eventually expected to total several
hundred million dollars and include contributions from many
countries. The $50 million comes on top of $150 million the
U.S. plans to contribute to individual countries over three
years for environmental projects. However, environmentalists
have argued that this spending isn't a real step toward
fighting global warming.
   Administration officials said the negotiators also will
agree to contribute $25 million over two years to help Third
World nations develop computer models to measure emissions
and better estimate the effect of their policies.
