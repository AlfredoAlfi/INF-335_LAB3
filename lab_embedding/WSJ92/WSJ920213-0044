Money-Fund Assets
   Rise Even as Yields
   Continue to Decline
The average seven-day compound yield, meanwhile, slid to
3.92% from 4%, the first drop below 4% since Donoghue's began
tracking money funds in 1975. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.
   The average seven-day simple yield eased to 3.85% from
3.92%. The average 30-day simple yield slipped to 3.97% from
4.06%, and the average 30-day compound yield declined to
4.05% from 4.14%.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments --
which include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit -- lengthened
by a day, to 57 days, indicating that fund managers don't
expect an increase in short-term interest rates any time
soon.
