Business Brief -- Heekin Can Inc.:
   Offer for Van Dorn Co.
   Is No Longer Considered
The Cincinnati maker of metal cans and containers also
said it hasn't made a definitive offer to buy Van Dorn, and
that it isn't in a position now to make an offer to buy the
Cleveland-based container and plastic molding equipment
concern. Heekin said Van Dorn has informed the company that
it's not interested in a business venture with Heekin.
   On Jan. 7, Crown Cork  Seal Co., a Philadelphia-based
container maker, offered to buy Van Dorn for $18 a share, or
$150 million, but Van Dorn rejected the offer. Later, Crown
said it would continue to hold open its offer to buy Van
Dorn, despite the company's rejection of its proposal.
   Van Dorn stock was quoted at $18.75 a share, unchanged, in
late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, while Heekin
stock fell $1.375 a share to close at $27 in national
over-the-counter trading.
