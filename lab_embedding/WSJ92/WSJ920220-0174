Who's News:
   Wells Fargo Chooses
   Patriarca, a Regulator,
   To Fill New Position
An OTS spokeswoman said no successor has been named to run
the western regional office based here.
   Mr. Patriarca is renowned in the thrift industry for
having stood up to the "Keating Five," the five U.S. senators
who in 1987 attempted to persuade regulators to be lenient
with Lincoln Savings  Loan on behalf of its chairman,
Charles Keating. Mr. Keating was recently convicted of
securities fraud and the senators' intervention was the
subject of lengthy Senate Ethics Committee hearings last
year.
   His skills as a regulator will be useful for Wells Fargo,
which has undergone some bruising regulatory examinations in
recent months, including one in the fourth quarter that
resulted in a $700 million loanloss provision and a big
quarterly loss. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said, "This is an
effort to bring in a broader perspective. We think we have a
good relationship with regulators."
   Mr. Patriarca is a California native. He earned a
bachelor's degree at the University of California at Davis, a
law degree at Santa Clara University and a master's degree in
law at George Washington University.
   Mr. Patriarca couldn't be reached for comment. He will
start work at the bank March 9.
