Business Brief -- Lafarge-Coppee S.A.:
   Cement Maker Is Expected
   To Post Decline in '91 Net
The company is the biggest cement producer in the U.S. and
was hit hard by the recession in North America, which
depressed the construction and public works industries and
reduced sales of cement and ready-mixed concrete.
   Lafarge's earnings were also affected by a continuing
price war in the European plasterboard sector that squeezed
profit margins. Persistent difficulties at Orsan, the
company's biotechnology subsidiary, also weighed on its
financial performance, analysts said.
