Who's News:
   Homestead Savings
   Names James Cirona
   As President and Chief
The resignations have come amid losses at the thrift,
which has seen its assets cut by two-thirds to $2 billion in
the past two years. In August, Homestead Savings raised $79
million in a debt swap to meet capital requirements.
   Mr. Cirona is best-known in the industry for his years as
a regulator. As head of San Francisco's Federal Home Loan
Bank from 1983 to 1991, he presided over regulatory efforts
to rein in some thrift operators, including Lincoln Savings'
Charles Keating. Mr. Cirona was one of the regulators who
attended the 1987 meeting at which five U.S. senators who had
received campaign contributions from Mr. Keating allegedly
pressured the regulators to ease up on Lincoln.
