Business Brief -- Levi Strauss Associates Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Jumped
   40% on 17% Revenue Rise
Levi continued to defy the recession with its fifth
consecutive year of record sales. Its U.S. sales rose 17% to
$3 billion and international sales increased 13% to $1.9
billion, but were partially offset by a strong U.S. dollar.
George B. James, chief executive officer, said sales were
especially strong in Levi's European and Asia Pacific
divisions.
   Mr. James said Levi's success was primarily due to strong
demand for its basic jeans, jeans-related clothing and other
casual wear. "However," he said, "as we move into the new
year, our outlook is cautious because of the continuing
sluggish economies in and outside the U.S."
   For all of 1991, net income rose 42% to $356.7 million on
a 15% increase in revenue to $4.9 billion. In 1990, Levi had
net income of $251 million on revenue of $4.2 billion.
