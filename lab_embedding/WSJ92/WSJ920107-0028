Agency Urges Safety Device
   To Aid in Read-End Crashes
Trucks already are required to have equipment to prevent
so-called underrides, but the new device is more effective,
the agency said. If adopted, the requirement would go into
effect two years after the issuance of a final rule, which is
several months away. The estimated cost is $112 per trailer.
The deadline for comments is March 3.
   The agency also is requesting public comment on ways to
reduce injuries and deaths in rollover crashes. The agency
said it hasn't settled on a particular method, but is
considering three options: requiring greater vehicle
stability to reduce rollovers; improving occupant protection
to reduce the effects of rollovers; and expanding consumer
information to alert vehicle owners about the potential for
rollovers.
   The agency said about 9,500 of the 33,600 vehicle occupant
deaths in 1989 occurred in rollover crashes. The deadline for
comments is April 3.
