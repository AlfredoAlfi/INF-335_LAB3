   Marketing Agreement
Stratus President William Foster said about 30% of the
anticipated revenue from the sales will go to Stratus, which
also has its own marketing staff in the U.K. Stratus had 1991
revenue of $448.6 million.
   Stratus was quoted in late New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at $46.25, down 37.5 cents.
   ICL and Stratus have worked together on similar projects
for several years, but the new agreement marks an aggressive
push for ICL into the field of so-called nonstop computing.
   Although the new pact is focused on U.K. sales, ICL said
it may also move into continental Europe, where Stratus has
marketing agreements with Sweden's L.M. Ericcson and Italy's
Ing. C. Olivetti  Co. But ICL said its non-U.K. efforts
would mostly be concentrated in Eastern Europe.
   Apart from giving impetus to a sales push, the Stratus
agreement gives ICL reliable access to computer technology it
doesn't make itself. Stratus, based in Marlboro, Mass., is a
specialist in "fault-tolerant" minicomputers.
