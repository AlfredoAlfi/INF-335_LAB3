Two Investors Sue
   Lifetime Products,
   Partnership Managers
In the complaint, the men asked that the managers of the
partnership be removed and that Lifetime and the others be
enjoined from taking any action affecting the stock option.
They also are asking for $25 million in punitive damages from
the partnership's managers.
   The Dallas lawsuit follows a ruling by a Kansas federal
judge last week dismissing a similar lawsuit filed by Messrs.
Doskocil and Bretches in Wichita on Dec. 31. The judge ruled
that the men, as limited partners in a partnership that was a
limited partner in another partnership owning the option,
didn't have jurisdiction to sue on behalf of the partnership
owning the option, in what is known as an interpleader
action. The lawsuit filed in Dallas, however, doesn't seek
interpleader status.
   Lifetime, a marketer of windshield wipers, said in January
that it couldn't proceed with negotiations to retire the
option by issuing new preferred stock because of the Kansas
litigation, even though it wasn't a defendant in the Kansas
suit. The company said yesterday that it hadn't seen the
Dallas lawsuit.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lifetime's stock closed at $4.875 a share, unchanged.
