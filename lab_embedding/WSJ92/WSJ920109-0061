Business Brief --  Toyota Motor Corp.:
   Firm Unveils Plan to Boost
   Purchases of U.S. Supplies
Toyota said that it will upgrade and strengthen its U.S.
organization for extending technical support to U.S. parts
makers by opening a "supplier support center" in the U.S. in
mid-1992.
   Toyota said it is also making itself more accessible to
U.S. suppliers by promoting so-called design-in activities,
which provide for joint work with parts makers in the early
stages of product development.
   Toyota said the purchase of auto parts and materials in
the U.S. is part of a "global-purchasing framework" that will
include total imports of about $2.9 billion by Toyota
operations in Japan in the year beginning April 1994, as well
as local purchasing by Toyota operations around the world.
Imports from the U.S. will account for $1.5 billion of that
total.
