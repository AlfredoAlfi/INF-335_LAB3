British Job Losses
   In February Increased
   To 9.4% From 9.2%
Figures from the Department of Employment showed that the
seasonally adjusted number of jobless rose by 40,200 in
February, taking the unemployment rate up to 9.4% from 9.2%.
Although the increase was less than January's 55,900,
economists said it still confirmed that the average monthly
increase is moving up again, after slipping to about 35,000
last autumn.
   The February increase took the unadjusted unemployment
total up to 2.71 million.
   Leaders of the opposition Labor Party called the figures a
"devastating indictment of the government," but Employment
Secretary Michael Howard pointed out that rising unemployment
"is not unique to Britain.
   "Unemployment has risen in recent months in most European
Community countries," he said. According to international
comparisons by the department, Britain's standardized
unemployment rate is now at 10.6%. This rate is the
third-highest in the EC after Spain and Ireland and well
above the EC average of 9.3%. It is also nearly double the
6.6% average rate for the Group of Seven major industrialized
countries.
