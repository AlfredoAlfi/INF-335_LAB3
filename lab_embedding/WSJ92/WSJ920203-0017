International:
   Peruvian Court Shelves
   Inquiry Into Dealings
   Of Ex-President Garcia
The Supreme Court overruled a final appeal by prosecuting
attorney Maria Drago, who questioned an earlier court
decision not to try Mr. Garcia.
   Four of the judges voted in favor of shelving the case,
and one voted against.
   "The legislative body, via a Senate vote, ordered the
judiciary to start a trial according to the law," said
Congressman Antero Flores-Araoz, who participated in the
Garcia investigation. "But the judiciary not only didn't want
to carry out a trial, it didn't even want to begin the
initial investigations. So it's finished, it's over, and it's
shelved."
   Analysts said it was a predictable outcome, as the Supreme
Court ruled in late December that there was insufficient
evidence to try Mr. Garcia. The court dismissed the attorney
general's formal accusation made in November and a vote by
both houses of Congress last year in favor of lifting Mr.
Garcia's congressional immunity so he could be tried. As a
former president, Mr. Garcia is a senator for life and thus
couldn't otherwise be tried in a court of law.
