International Brief -- Cap Gemini Sogeti S.A.:
   French Concern Forms Unit
   With the Netherlands' WSG
Cap Gemini plans to merge its Dutch holding company, Cap
Gemini Pandata, and its Belgian Cap Gemini Sesa Belgium with
Volmac in exchange for new Volmac shares, which will be
issued in a capital increase. No cash will change hands. Cap
Gemini said that no takeover is expected on any shares of
Volmac that remain in the public. The Volmac unit will
continue to be traded publicly.
   Cap Gemini will be the majority shareholder in the new
unit.
   The move continues Cap Gemini's strategy of forming
partnerships with other companies in the fragmented computer
services industry.
   The new group would have had 1991 revenue of about or 2.7
billion francs ($478.8 million) and 4,000 employees.
