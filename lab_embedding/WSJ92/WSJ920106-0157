Letters to the Editor:
   Robber Barons' Greed
   Helped Create `Beast'
Moral hazard dictates that there is an unavoidable
trade-off between the level of governmental regulation and
the extent of social abuses committed by modern-day robber
barons. In your zeal to dismantle and dispense with
governmental oversight, you are blinded by your own hubris.
There is no panacea for what ails this nation.
