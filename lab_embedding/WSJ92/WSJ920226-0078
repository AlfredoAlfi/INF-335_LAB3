Park-Ohio Industries
   Will Acquire Assets
   Of Closely Held Firm
Park-Ohio said Kay Home Products would receive 850,000
Park-Ohio shares, and as many as 1.15 million more shares if
Kay Home Products is able to meet certain income projections.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Park-Ohio rose 12.5
cents to $3.875.
   Although the transaction is subject to various conditions,
including approval of Park-Ohio shareholders, the company
said it expects the purchase will be completed during the
second quarter. Kay Home Products makes barbeque grills,
patio tables, leisure trays and lawn spreaders.
   Park-Ohio said once the acquisition is completed, Thomas
E. McGinty, who assumed the posts of interim chairman and
chief executive in November, will step down. Mr. McGinty will
remain on the board.
   The agreement also includes a standstill agreement that
prohibits, among other things, Kay Home Products and Mr.
Crawford from acquiring additional shares of the company or
seeking a change in control of Park-Ohio.
   Park-Ohio is a maker of plastic and steel containers,
forged and machine products, induction heating systems and
industrial rubber products.
