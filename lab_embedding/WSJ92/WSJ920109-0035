UAL Agrees to Change
   Executive-Pay Disclosures
Although UAL's move is less sweeping than ITT's,
compensation consultants still termed it significant. "It's
been unusual up until now, but now there's a very pronounced
trend for management to negotiate with shareholders" on
compensation matters, said Robert Salwen, a consultant with
William M. Mercer Inc.
   United Shareholders Association said UAL, the parent of
United Airlines based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., has agreed
that in its 1992 proxy, it will make a clearer disclosure of
such items as the split between annual pay and bonus; the
basis for payment of any bonus and the time period the bonus
covers; stock options and restricted stock grants; and the
compensation consultant used by the compensation committee.
   UAL spokeswoman Lynn Martenstein declined to discuss
specific changes, saying only that "we are in complete
agreement with the United Shareholders Association and are
pleased that their concerns have been addressed."
