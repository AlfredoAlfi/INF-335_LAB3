AMR Claim Rejected
   In Suit to Block UAL
   Acquisition of Air Wis
Air Wis holders vote Thursday on the merger plan. UAL,
Chicago, owns United Airlines, American's archrival.
   "American's interest in this litigation is to prevent the
merger of UAL and Air Wis at all costs," Judge Martin wrote
on Friday. He said that American recently purchased 100
shares of Air Wis stock only to mask its charges as those of
a concerned shareholder. But American's real interest, he
said, is in avoiding the increased competition that the
merger will bring. "American is not attempting to advance the
general interests of Air Wis shareholders."
   Air Wisconsin, with its 37 planes, is the largest commuter
carrier operated in United Airlines' feeder network. Air
Wisconsin's most valuable assets are the lease rights it
holds to 168 slots, or take-off and landing rights, at O'Hare
International Airport. Air Wis rejected a $150 million offer
from American for the lease rights.
   A Feb. 10 trial date has been set to hear additional
opposition from American concerning potential federal
antitrust violations that the merger might cause. Of the
lease rights on slots at O'Hare, United now has 764 vs. 579
for American.
   AMR noted the dismissal doesn't affect the antitrust part
of its case.
