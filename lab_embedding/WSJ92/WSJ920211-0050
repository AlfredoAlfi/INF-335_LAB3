Business Brief -- Manville Corp.:
   Fiberglass Unit Is Renamed
   Schuller International Inc.
In June 1991, Manville changed the name of its paperboard
unit to Riverwood International Corp., after Manville
reorganized as a holding company. Manville may also change
its corporate name, but that wouldn't happen for a couple of
years, a spokesman said.
   Richard A. Kashnow, president of Schuller, said, "We are
making the change now to create a strong identity for this
subsidiary and to support our parent company's efforts to
have its securities fairly valued."
