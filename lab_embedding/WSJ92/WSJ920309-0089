Marketing Brief -- New Line Cinema Corp.:
   Movie Concern Reports Net
   Declined for Fourth Quarter
New Line said its fourth-quarter results were hurt by the
box-office results from "Suburban Commando." The company took
unspecified write-off costs related to the movie. New Line
said it would record additional revenue from the movie when
it is released in various ancillary markets, such as home
videocassettes. Revenue was strong from the release in
theaters of "House Party 2" and the videocassette release of
"City Slickers."
   For the year, however, New Line's net rose 41% to $8.9
million, or 66 cents a share, from $6.3 million, or 58 cents
a share in 1990. Revenue rose to $225.7 million from $133.1
million.
   New Line is currently attempting to acquire control of
Orion Pictures Corp., which filed for protection under
federal bankruptcy law in December.
