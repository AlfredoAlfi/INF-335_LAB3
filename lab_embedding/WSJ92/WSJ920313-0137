Technology Brief -- Wang Laboratories Inc.:
   Hitachi Is Granted License
   For Memory Module Line
In the case, the court found that NEC Corp. and Toshiba
Corp. had made and sold the memory modules in violation of
Wang patents, and ordered the companies to pay Wang $3.3
million, plus interest, for the infringement. Wang also asked
the International Trade Commission to ban imports into the
U.S. of the modules and any products that incorporate them if
they violate the Wang patents.
   The ITC on Feb. 20 voted to investigate imports of the
devices into the U.S. Wang agreed to drop its ITC charges
against Hitachi as part of the licensing accord.
