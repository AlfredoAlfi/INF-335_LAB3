Business Brief:
   Carnival Cruise Lines
   Takes a Write-Down,
   Posts Quarterly Loss
Revenue rose 13% to $305.6 million from $270.4 million.
   The write-down, which brings the stated value of the
Crystal Palace Hotel and Casino to $50 million, had been
expected.
   Carnival agreed in October to sell up to 40% of the resort
to the Bahamian government, in return for forgiveness of $70
million in debt. Carnival said yesterday that the transaction
is expected to be completed in the current calendar quarter.
   As for selling the remaining stake, a Carnival spokesman
said, "There have been discussions, but we haven't been able
to put anything together yet."
   For all of fiscal 1991, Carnival's earnings, including the
write-down, fell to $85 million, or 62 cents a share, from
$206.2 million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. However,
earnings from continuing operations rose 8%, to $253.8
million, or $1.85 a share, from $234.4 million, or $1.74 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $1.40 billion from
$1.25 billion.
