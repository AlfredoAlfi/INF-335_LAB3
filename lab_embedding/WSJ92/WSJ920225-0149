McDonnell Douglas Agreement
McDonnell Douglas said the joint development agreement,
which is subject to U.S. government approval, calls for the
possible design and manufacture of demonstrator aircraft that
would test new engine and manufacturing technologies.
   Separately, McDonnell's helicopter division in Mesa,
Ariz., said the Philippine Air Force ordered eight additional
MD-500 Defender helicopters to augment its current fleet of
22. The value of the sale wasn't announced.
