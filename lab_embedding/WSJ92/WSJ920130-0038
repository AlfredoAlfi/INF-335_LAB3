Business Brief -- Inco Ltd.:
   Nickel Producer Had Loss
   Of $5.8 Million in Quarter
Revenue fell 18.4% to $710.3 million from $870.3 million.
   All of Inco's operating divisions lost money. Its primary
metals division was hardest hit, mainly because of a 17.6%
drop in realized nickel prices, to an average $3.55 a pound
from $4.31 a pound a year earlier. Inco, based in Toronto,
said operating expenditures rose in part due to higher labor
costs following the signing of new contracts at its Canadian
operations.
   Inco said it has budgeted $280 million for capital
expenditures this year, down from $440 million spent last
year.
   For the year, Inco had net of $82.6 million, or 74 cents a
share, down from $441.2 million, or $4.18 a share, in 1990.
Revenue fell to $3.05 billion from $3.34 billion.
