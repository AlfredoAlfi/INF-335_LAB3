Business Brief -- GTE Corp.:
   Marketing Pact With IBM
   On Backup Power Is Signed
GTE said its Spacenet unit will provide satellite-based
metered service and access to IBM's regional computer "hot
sites" -- a series of backup sites around the U.S. that
provide processing power if subscribers unexpectedly lose
their own. Metered service is designed to meet a range of
transmission requirements for such business applications as
data and image transmission, network protection/backup and
video teleconferencing.
   IBM's business recovery services unit will market GTE's
metered service, which is already installed at IBM's Tampa,
Fla., site.
