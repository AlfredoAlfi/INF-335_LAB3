U.K. to Probe Role
   Of NatWest Aides
   In Blue Arrow Case
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
County NatWest Ltd., the investment banking arm of
NatWest, was adviser to Blue Arrow, a British employment
agency, during its bid for Manpower Inc. of the U.S. It and
UBS Phillips  Drew Ltd., another major investment house,
underwrote the rights issue Blue Arrow used to finance its
bid for Manpower.
   It was later found that the underwriters retained a large
chunk of the offering on their books after it flopped, but
failed to disclose the holding. The investment houses were
acquitted of fraud charges, although three former County
NatWest executives and a former Phillips  Drew official were
convicted last month of conspiracy.
   Mr. Frost and NatWest have denied the magazine's
allegations, which maintained there is evidence Mr. Frost
initialed key Blue Arrow documents in the case.
   The Department of Trade and Industry said inspectors will
"look in particular at the role played by senior officers of
National Westminster Bank PLC in the offer by Blue Arrow PLC
for the whole of the issued share capital of Manpower Inc. in
1987."
   Mr. Frost, 58 years old, rose to group chief executive at
NatWest in July 1987. He has been expected to retire from the
post before the end of 1993.
