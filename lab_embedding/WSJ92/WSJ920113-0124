Village Financial Says
   4th-Quarter Net Rose
   By Better Than 13%
Commenting on analysts' estimates earlier this year that
Village Financial would report 1991 earnings of $1.50 to
$1.70 a share, Mr. Winstead said profit for the year was "on
the upper end of the range and may well exceed it." That
range would put overall net income at between $3.5 million
and $3.9 million, or better. The company expects to report
earnings later this month.
   For all of 1990, Village Financial earned $3.6 million, or
$1.54 a share. For the 1990 fourth quarter, it posted net of
$634,000, or 27 cents a share.
   Although its aggressiveness in the residential mortgage
loan market and enforcement of strict underwriting standards
in commercial lending have paid off, Mr. Winstead credited
the bank's investment portfolio with a slightly better than
50% contribution to 1991 earnings.
   In addition, Mr. Winstead said, "with the focus on cost
containment and prudent growth, I trust we can deliver
another solid increase in earnings" for 1992.
