Man Allegedly Posed
   As Futures Member,
   Is Accused of Fraud
To lull clients into a false sense of security, Mr. Naulin
allegedly provided them with fictitious monthly account
statements in the name of a commodities trading concern. He
also allegedly failed to disclose that he was convicted of
securities and mail fraud on Oct. 12, 1989, and sentenced to
one year in custody.
   Federal prosecutors also said Mr. Naulin, who is 34 years
old, continued to perpetrate his allegedly fraudulent scheme
while he was serving six months in a community confinement
facility.
   Mr. Naulin is in jail in Los Angeles; he couldn't be
reached for comment. He doesn't yet have an attorney, federal
prosecutors said.
