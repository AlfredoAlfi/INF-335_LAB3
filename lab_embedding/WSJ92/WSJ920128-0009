   Of Orders Is Re-Counted
Boeing also said that 1991 orders for its medium-range 757
twinjet were increased by six because of unannounced option
conversions. The value of these six is about $300 million.
   In addition, one 737-300, inadvertently counted twice
during 1991, was removed from the public order list. The
final tally for Boeing's announced orders in 1991 is 257
jetliners valued at about $20.55 billion. Announced orders to
date in 1992 total 16 jetliners with a value of about $1.67
billion. These consist of two 737-300s, four 747-400s and 10
of the 777s, Boeing said.
