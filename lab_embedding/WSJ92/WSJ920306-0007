The company said its board approved its previously
announced plan to "separate" Office Angels from Lifetime. The
separation "may be achieved by either a distribution to
shareholders" of stock in the unit or by sale of the unit,
said Anthony H. Reeves, president and chief executive officer
of Lifetime. "We currently anticipate that the separation
will be achieved by a dividend to shareholders, although the
specific terms are still under review."
   Mr. Reeves said the decision to separate the Office Angels
unit, which provides temporary and permanent office
personnel, reflects Lifetime's "commitment to maintaining its
leadership position in the rapidly growing field of alternate
site health care."
   Randall Huyser, an analyst with Furman Selz Inc., said the
unit "was not a good strategic fit" with Lifetime and "masked
the fairly good growth in its home health care business."
   Lifetime said that in 1991, revenue from its home health
care services business rose 34% to $620 million.
   For 1991, the company posted a loss of $25 million, or
$2.27 a share, compared with 1990 profit of $17.7 million, or
$2 a share. Revenue rose 28% to $778.7 million from $609.8
million.
