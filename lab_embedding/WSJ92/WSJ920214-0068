The results surprised Wall Street. In an interview last
week, when asked about analysts' fourth-quarter estimates of
19 to 27 cents a share, Phillip White, the company's chief
executive officer, said, "We've said those are all okay." Mr.
White said that in his previous comment, "I was confirming
the analysts' estimate and wasn't giving an indication that
the actual results would be in their ranges."
   Yesterday, the company's stock was quoted at $32.50 a
share in national overthe-counter trading, up $6.50.
