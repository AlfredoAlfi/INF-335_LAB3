Gulf Canada Rating Is Cut
The Calgary, Alberta, company, 73%-owned by the Reichmann
family of Toronto through its Olympia  York Developments
Ltd. unit, is struggling under a heavy debt load while prices
for crude oil and natural gas continue to languish.
   Craig Langpap, manager of investor relations at Gulf, said
it is the company's understanding that the downgrade isn't
linked to reports of a cash-flow crunch at Olympia  York.
"We've been told the rating is based solely on Gulf and its
operations," he said.
   The rating on Gulf's senior debentures was lowered to Ba-2
from Baa-3. Its shelf registration for senior debt was
downgraded to prospective Ba-2 from prospective Baa-3. The
rating for commercial paper dropped to not-prime from
prime-3. Moody's also lowered the rating on the company's
Series I preference shares to single-B-1 from Ba-1.
