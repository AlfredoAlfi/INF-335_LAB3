Equifax to Slash the Cost
   Of Inspecting Credit Data
Congress is considering a new law requiring
credit-reporting companies to give consumers a free annual
report and charge no more than $8 for any additional report.
   By current law, consumers are entitled to free reports if
they have been declined for credit or a job.
   Equifax officials acknowledged the proposed new law was
partly responsible for the new price cut, but also said the
company's cost of providing a consumer's credit report has
fallen over the last year. Equifax's new $8 price goes into
effect March 1.
   The third big player in the $1 billion credit-reporting
industry, closely held Trans Union Corp., charges consumers
an average of $20 for copies of their own reports. A Trans
Union spokeswoman said the company doesn't currently plan to
cut the price.
