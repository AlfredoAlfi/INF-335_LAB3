Marketing Brief -- Enquirer/Star Group Inc.:
   Tabloid Firm's Profit Rose
   In 3rd Quarter, 9 Months
For the nine months, the publisher, based in Lantana,
Fla., posted net of $11.1 million, or seven cents a share
after preferred dividend of 26 cents a share, compared with
the year-earlier $890,000, or 49-cent-a-share loss after
preferred dividends of 53 cents a share.
   Average shares outstanding rose in the nine months to 34.2
million from 22.7 million. The company said results of the
Star are included for only 24 weeks of the yearago nine
months, since the June 1990 acquisition of the tabloid.
   David Galpern, executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said the improved earnings were due in
part to a soap opera magazine launched in October and a
British edition of the National Enquirer launched in June.
   He said that in July the company boosted the price for the
National Enquirer to 95 cents a copy from 85 cents.
