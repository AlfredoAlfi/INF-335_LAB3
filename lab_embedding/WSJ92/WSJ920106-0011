Credit Ratings:
   Arco Debt Facing
   Possible Downgrade
   In Moody's Review
Moody's said its review also will focus on Arco's cash
flow and the earnings effects of potentially weaker crude oil
prices, as well as the company's ambitious capital spending
program. The rating company also said it is concerned by the
longer-term implications of declining production in Arco's
important Alaskan oil fields and the company's ability to
replace that production.
   Moody's said that commercial paper issued by Arco and its
subsidiaries isn't under review and is confirmed at Prime-1.
Long-debt under review consists of that of the parent
company, its Arco Overseas Finance Co. unit and the Arco
Pipeline Co. unit, Moody's said.
   In November, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered to single-A-1
from single-A-1-plus its rating on Arco's commercial paper
and that of its units but left standing its single-A-plus
rating on long-term debt.
   Arco common closed Friday at $109, down 37.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
