Business Brief -- Bioplasty Inc.:
   Breast-Implant Maker Agrees
   To Settle Shareholder Suit
The action would settle a suit filed last summer after the
Food and Drug Administration seized the company's Misti Gold
inflatable breast implants because of alleged failure to seek
FDA permission to market the devices.
   Bioplasty, which denies the allegations in the lawsuit,
said the settlement is subject to several conditions,
including approval by a federal judge.
   News of government objections to one of Bioplasty's most
promising products sent its stock tumbling $6.50 to $10 July
31. Yesterday, Bioplasty traded at $5.25 in national
over-the-counter trading before being halted for news of the
proposed settlement.
