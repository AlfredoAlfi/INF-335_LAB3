   Bristol-Myers Is Sued
   Over Its Former Line
   Of Breast Implants
The Surgitek implant was the only silicone breast implant
with a polyurethane coating and has been implanted in about
10% of the two million women who have had breast implants.
The plantiff's attorneys said they expect to add claims
against Bristol-Myers' other silicone-based products and Dow
Corning Corp., a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and
Corning Inc. that manufactures silicone breast implants, by
the end of the week.
   Bristol-Myers announced that it would close the Surgitek
unit last September after the company failed to meet Food and
Drug Administration deadlines for providing certain safety
and effectiveness data. The company emphasized the action
didn't reflect any safety problems with the implant, but said
obtaining the necessary data to keep Surgitek in business
would be too long and costly.
   Officials at Bristol-Myers declined to comment on the
suit.
