Marketing  Media:
   Recorded Music Sales
   Rose Almost 4% in '91;
   Unit Sales Fell 7.5%
Music sales rose to $7.8 million in 1991, from $7.5
million the year before, marking the ninth consecutive year
of dollar growth: Sales have doubled in a decade. Unit sales
(including compact disks, audio casettes, vinyl records and
music videos) fell to 801 million units from 866 million
units in 1990.
   Although the music business likes to think of itself as
recession-proof, results of last year prove otherwise. Sales
of cassette tapes were off nearly 19%, which "shows the
economy hit hardest at the lower end of the economic scale,"
Mr. Berman said. Although cassette sales have been declining
as consumers switch to compact disk players from tape
players, the decline has been modest. Sales of compact disks
rose about 16% in units in 1991, the trade group said.
