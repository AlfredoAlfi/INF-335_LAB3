Business Brief -- Tektronix Inc.:
   Electronics Firm to Report
   A Loss for Current Quarter
Tektronix said the charge covers a consolidation of its
European distribution operations, abandonment of some
development work and a 500-person reduction in its work force
in the next six months. It employs about 11,500 currently.
   The company also said it was suffering because of weak
computer, military and television industry markets, although
it said sales of some new products, such as color printers
and midrange digital oscilloscopes, were doing well.
