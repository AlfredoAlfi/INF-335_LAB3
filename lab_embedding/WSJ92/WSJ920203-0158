Pepper...and Salt
Yesterday we celebrated Groundhog Day;
   Weather forecasting is his game;
   For someone afraid of his own shadow,
   He's earned quite a bit of fame.

   Picture This
                                                                                                       

   At a sporting event
   Or a musical show
   Where children perform
   And parents go,
   You'll find a contingent
   Along the borders,
   Vying for space
   With all their camcorders.
   -- Pat D'Amico.
