International:
   ANZ to Revamp U.S. Business
Effective Jan. 31, all U.S. business activities will be
managed out of ANZ's New York branch, although a group of
senior executives will remain in Los Angeles to support ANZ's
network business on the West Coast.
   ANZ's Canadian subsidiary in Toronto also will be
restructured.
