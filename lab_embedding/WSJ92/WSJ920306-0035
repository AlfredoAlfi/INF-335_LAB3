Marketing  Media:
   Pay-Per-View Olympics
   To Add Less Costly Option
Now, in addition to three packages priced at $95, $125 and
$170, the partners will offer subscribers individual 24-hour
blocks of the entire three-channel Olympics coverage for
$29.95 a day.
   The new offer doesn't make selling the pay-per-view events
any easier for NBC and its partner. They must still convince
viewers accustomed to watching free Olympic events to pay for
the first time, even as 160 hours of the Games will be aired
for free on the NBC network.
   NBC paid $401 million for U.S. television rights to the
Summer Games in Barcelona. An additonal $100 million will be
spent for marketing and production of the pay-per-view
coverage.
   The pay-per-view venture is aiming to sign up close to 5%
of the 40 million homes it hopes will be able to receive the
pay-per-view fare; to date it can reach about 37 million
homes.
