Business Brief -- Zale Corp.:
   Bankruptcy Judge Approves
   Financing of $19.5 Million
In his ruling, the judge denied a request that Zale's
Gordon Jewelry Corp. unit guarantee the interim financing.
   A lawyer for the company said Zale had only $5 million
left. The interim funds should keep Zale operating until a
hearing on its permanent debtor-in-possession financing,
scheduled for March 16.
   The company has a commitment from Chemical Bank for a $510
million line, including an accounts receivable credit line
and a working capital line, which would provide funds while
it tries to work out a plan to pay about $1.5 billion of
debt.
