International:
   Singapore's Consumer Prices Fall
Prices of food and miscellaneous items rose marginally by
0.1% and 0.4% respectively.
   Over the year, though, prices were up for most items
except for housing, which declined 0.1%. The Department of
Statistics, which compiled the figures, said that lower
tariffs for electricity also caused housing costs to drop
1.1% in February from January.
   The CPI measures the average change in prices for a fixed
basket of goods commonly consumed by households. Food
comprises the largest group at 40%, followed by miscellaneous
items at 23%. Housing takes up another 17%, transport and
communication 14%, and clothing 6%.
