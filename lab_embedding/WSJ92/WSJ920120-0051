Business Brief -- Urcarco Inc.:
   Car-Lot Concern Dismisses
   70 of Its 150 Sales Staff
The layoffs were the latest in a series of deep
cost-cutting measures for the once-fast-growing concern. Amid
declining sales and rising repossession rates during 1991,
the company closed several car lots, eliminated the jobs of
four top executives and terminated its borrowing agreement
with lenders after posting losses that caused it to violate
the terms of that agreement.
