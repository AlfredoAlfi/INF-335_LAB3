First Capital Holdings'
   Creditors Prepare Lawsuit
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
First Capital Holdings is the holding company of Fidelity
Bankers Life Insurance Co. in Richmond, Va., and First
Capital Life Insurance Co. in Los Angeles. Shearson owns 28%
of First Capital Holdings.
   The lawsuit is said to charge Shearson and some directors
and officers of First Capital Holdings with mismanagement of
the company and a breach of their duties to the company.
Shearson is also charged with not taking action to prevent
the failure of the company even though Shearson was aware of
First Capital Holdings' problems.
   Prior to the seizure of the two life insurance units last
summer, California's insurance commissioner, John Garamendi,
asked American Express to inject additional capital into the
companies. When American Express failed to put up additional
funds, he took over the California unit. That move was
followed by a takeover of the Virginia company by regulators
there.
