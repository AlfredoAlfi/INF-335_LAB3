Technology:
   Unit of Tandy Rolls Out
   First `Wearable' Computer
Grid, a Fremont, Calif., unit of Tandy Corp., said it
expects the PalmPad to be used in areas such as
manufacturing, distribution, law enforcement and market
research, where workers need to collect data but don't want
to be weighed down with bulky equipment. Grid also said the
computer is designed to be durable enough to withstand a
three-foot drop onto concrete.
   The machine, which was introduced at a "fashion show" in
New York, will sell for about $2,895.
