Business Brief -- Travelers Corp.:
   Sale of Notes to Bolster
   Insurance Unit Completed
The spokesman said efforts to boost the insurer's capital
will continue. In the insurer's annual report for 1991, it
said it's considering a wide variety of other capital-raising
options, including sales of businesses or selling a stake to
an investor.
   The notes carry a fixed interest rate of 9.5%, higher than
rates offered by other insurers on similar issues recently.
Edward Budd, Travelers chairman, said the capital markets are
currently "attractive," however. "The debt offering was an
efficient and economically attractive route to add capital
and support growth for the company's life operation," he
said.
