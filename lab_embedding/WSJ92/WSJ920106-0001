   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Foreign investors will be allowed to buy as much as 40% of
Petrogal's total capital, the government said.
   Shares offered in the first phase will have a base price
of 1,700 escudos ($12.82). Government sources said the sale
of the first portion is expected to raise at least 40.8
billion escudos. Some 24 million Petrogal shares will be
offered initially, 19 million from a new issue and five
million from the government's holding.
   People with knowledge of the Portuguese market said French
oil company Total S.A., Italy's Agip Petroli S.p.A. and Du
Pont Co. of the U.S. are expected to bid in association with
local investors.
   A Du Pont spokesman said the company wouldn't comment.
   The successful bidder for the first 26% slice is expected
to be given preference in the sale's second phase of 25%. The
planned share issue will raise Petrogal's capital to 86
billion escudos from 77 billion escudos. The government is
expected eventually to sell all but a 10% stake in Petrogal.
   Of the total capital, 19% is expected to be reserved for
strategic investors including the Calouste Gulbenkian
foundation and the Angolan state oil company Sonangol.
   Petrogal had 1990 after-tax profit of 3.58 billion
escudos.
