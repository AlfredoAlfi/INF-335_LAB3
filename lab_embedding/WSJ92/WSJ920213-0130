   4th-Period Loss, Cuts
   Its Dividend Payment
The loss for the final three months of 1991 left the
company with a net loss for the year of $4.9 million, or 36
cents a share. In 1990, Federal-Mogul had a fourth-quarter
loss of $8.7 million, or 39 cents a share, which reduced
full-year profit to $4.4 million, or 20 cents a share.
   The latest fourth-quarter loss resulted from a one-time
pretax charge of $25 million, or 98 cents a share. That
charge covered the company's costs of reducing employment and
reorganizing its manufacturing operations.
   Martin E. Welch III, Federal-Mogul's senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said the charge includes
restructuring costs it anticipates for 1992, the third year
of its three-year plan.
   The fourth-quarter charge offset the company's after-tax
gain of $16.2 million, or 72 cents a share, from the sale of
its Huck Manufacturing subsidiary. Federal-Mogul sold the
unit in the fourth quarter.
