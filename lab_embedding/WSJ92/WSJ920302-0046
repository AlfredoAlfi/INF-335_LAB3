New York State Judge
   Clears Way for Sale
   Of Tax Revenue Bonds
The court action comes in connection with a lawsuit filed
Feb. 6 by Robert Schulz, president of the All-County
Taxpayers Association Inc. The suit questions whether the
corporation should be allowed to issue long-term debt without
voter approval. State officals have asked that the case be
dismissed, and Judge Harris is expected to rule on that
motion Wednesday.
   The bonds were priced to yield from 3.6% in 1993 to 7.18%
in 2021. The issue is rated single-A by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and by Standard  Poor's Corp. The issue is
rated single-A-plus by Fitch Investors Service Inc.
