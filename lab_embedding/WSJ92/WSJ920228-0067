Scientist Fails to Determine
   If Doctor Killed Huey Long
"There wasn't much of a body left," he said. "But we did
find that Dr. Weiss acted defensively," trying to shield
himself from bullets. Mr. Starrs said his study found that
more than 50% of Dr. Weiss's bullet wounds were in the back.
Forensic evidence showed that two bullets in Dr. Weiss's
skull had fibers on them, suggesting that they went through
clothing first, and one of those bullets had gone through Dr.
Weiss's left wrist first.
   It's possible Dr. Weiss could have shot Mr. Long and then
acted defensively, Mr. Starrs said, but evidence outside the
exhumation suggests otherwise. Mr. Starrs has examined Dr.
Weiss's gun and a spent .32 caliber bullet collected from the
crime scene. "Somebody else was firing a .32 caliber gun in
that corridor," said Mr. Starrs. "In my heart, I think this
is the bullet that killed Huey Long," he said.
