Toronto Exchange to End
   Floor Trading in Equities
There are about 240 traders who currently use the floor,
including 123 specialists, or registered traders, who make
markets in specific Toronto-listed stocks. They will join
about 45 other specialists who already operate from their
offices.
   Mr. Bunting said the decision to eliminate floor trading
will result in changes to the TSE's bylaws, which must be
approved by the Ontario Securities Commission.
   Floor-based trading in options and derivatives will
continue to take place either on a section of the TSE trading
floor, or it will be moved elsewhere, a TSE spokesman said.
