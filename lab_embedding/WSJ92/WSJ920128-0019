Rio Algom Ltd. Plans
   To Spend $290 Million
   On Chile Mine Project
Development of the project, which was approved by the
Chilean government's foreign-investment committee, is
expected to begin within two months, and full production is
scheduled for late 1994, he said. The mine is expected to
produce 40,000 metric tons of high quality copper cathode
annually, worth about $86 million a year at current market
prices. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   Meanwhile, Rio Algom said it is no longer seeking buyers
for its three metals distribution businesses because the
offers it received were too low.
   The company said it will continue to run the businesses,
which distribute stainless and specialty steels and aluminum
in Canada, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, and may try
again to sell them when the economy improves. Rio Algom
previously said it wanted to sell the businesses to
concentrate on its mining operations.
