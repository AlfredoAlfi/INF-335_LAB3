Business Brief:
   Occidental Posts $6 Million Net Income
   For Quarter, Against Year-Earlier Loss
Ray Irani, chairman, said the company has nearly completed
the restructuring that began after the death of the former
chairman, Armand Hammer, in December 1990. Still, weak
conditions in the oil and natural gas businesses eroded
earnings, and the company will continue to reduce costs and
pay down debt.
   For the year, Occidental reported net income of $460
million, or $1.52 a share, compared with a net loss of $1.7
billion, or $5.82 a share, for 1990. Net sales fell to $10.1
billion from $11.51 billion.
   The 1991 results included an extraordinary gain of $143
million from the use of tax-loss carry-forwards; the gain was
partly offset by a loss of $109 million from early
extinguishment of debt. They also reflected a $642 million
gain from asset sales, as well as a $466 million charge for
asset value adjustments.
   The results treat meatpacker IBP Inc. as a discontinued
operation, as Occidental sold its 51% stake in the company in
a rights offering in the 1991 third quarter. Occidental's
share of the unit's operating losses and a $57 million loss
on disposition were offset by the application of a tax
credit, resulting in a contribution to net.
