Winter Olympics 1992:
   Television Highlights
   ----
   By Kevin Goldman
Figure skating will be prominent on CBS this evening as
pairs world champs Natalya Mishkutienok and Artur Dmitriev of
the United Team pursue the gold medal. CBS also will air
taped highlights of the hockey matchup between the U.S. and
Germany, and the women's luge competition in which Cammy
Myler from Lake Placid, N.Y., has a chance for a medal.
                                                                                                       

   Impressive Ratings
                                                                                                       

   So far CBS is doing a lot better than the U.S. team.
Sunday night the network attracted an impressive 23.4% of
U.S. homes with TV sets nationally, according to ratings from
A.C. Nielsen Co. Four years ago, ABC drew 19.7% for the first
night of competition (a Saturday) at the Calgary Games.
   Over the first two nights of the Albertville Games, CBS
averaged 19%, which is 3.5 percentage points higher than ABC
drew for the opening two nights four years ago. CBS
guaranteed its advertisers an average of 17%.
                                                                                                       

   Mismatched Pair
                                                                                                       

   Some viewers were enthusiastic about Greg Gumbel's
enthusiasm and expertise during CBS's morning coverage. The
same can't be said, however, for the mismatched pair of Tim
McCarver and Paula Zahn, who anchor the evening broadcasts.
They sit on an unfortunate studio set that could be anywhere
and doesn't take advantage of the beauty of the French Alps.
Their banter is lackluster.
