Nordstrom Reports
   Profit Declined 12%
   In Fiscal 4th Quarter
December's performance "lagged behind the rest of the
quarter," said Nordstrom, "resulting in a weaker fourth
quarter than originally anticipated." It also said, "Southern
California sales continue to prove challenging."
   The per-share earnings were toward the low end, or a few
cents below, what most analysts had been anticipating.
   Nordstrom disclosed its results after the market's close;
in national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the company's
shares were quoted at $40, up $1.25.
   Results for the full year, the company said, "demonstrate
improvements in operating performance, despite the difficult
retail environment." Nordstrom's earnings for the year
increased 17% to $135.8 million, or $1.66 a share, from
$115.8 million, or $1.42 a share.
   Sales for the year rose 9.9% to $3.18 billion from $2.89
billion.
