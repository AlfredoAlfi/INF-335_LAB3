Money-Fund Assets
   Rose in Latest Week;
   Yields Slipped Again
Assets of 532 taxable funds grew by $4.1 billion, to just
under $499 billion, according to the Ashland, Mass.,
newsletter. Institutional investors added about $4.5 billion
to the funds, while individuals withdrew about $400 million.
   That followed an outflow totaling $12.8 billion in the
week ended March 2, according to Donoghue's, including $10.1
billion from funds open only to institutions.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments ---
which include Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit
and commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs)remained at
57 days, indicating that fund managers don't expect yields to
change dramatically any time soon.
   The average seven-day simple yield eased to 3.72% from
3.75% in the latest week, Donoghue's said. The average 30day
simple yield slipped to 3.77% from 3.80%, while the average
30-day compound yield declined to 3.84% from 3.87%.
   The average seven-day compound yield on tax-exempt money
funds slid to 2.50% from 2.57%, Donoghue's said. The latest
yield is equivalent to a taxable 3.47% for an investor in the
28% tax bracket and to 3.62% for someone paying 31% in taxes.
   Assets of the 293 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose by more than $900 million, to $98.9 billion. Average
maturity remained at 52 days.
