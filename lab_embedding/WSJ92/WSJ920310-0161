Financing Business:
   Toronto-Dominion's
   Debt Rating Lowered
   By SP; Profits Cited
Despite rising profits at most big Canadian banks,
Toronto-Dominion's net income fell 8.7% in its fiscal first
quarter, ended Jan. 31, to 115 million Canadian dollars
(US$96.5 million). Return on assets, a key measure of bank
performance, fell to 0.66% from 0.72%.
   Toronto-Dominion's loan problems stem from its relatively
high exposure to Ontario and the U.S. "The recent recession
has significantly impacted the credit-worthiness of a large
number of the institution's corporate customers in these
areas," SP said. The bank had net nonperforming loans of
C$1.73 billion as of Jan. 31, up 29% from a year earlier.
   SP said it reduced to double-A from double-A-plus its
rating on Toronto-Dominion's long-term debt. The rating on
the bank's subordinated debt was lowered to double-A-minus
from double-A. The New York rating concern put the bank's
debt on CreditWatch last month.
   SP also downgraded the senior long-term debt of the
bank's Australian subsidiary and its Canadian mortgage
business. These ratings, affecting $700 million in debt, were
lowered to double-A from double-A-plus.
