The association said that cellular companies invested $2.4
billion, or 42% of 1991 revenue, in capital improvements and
expansion. And the number of activated cellular systems rose
last year to 1,252, from 751 in 1990.
   The figures, which are for the U.S. only, are based on a
survey of the 1,252 cellular systems in the U.S. The
association said 1,005 systems responded.
