Business Brief -- Caterpillar Inc.:
   UAW Rejects a Contract
   Billed as Firm's Last Offer
About 2,400 of the 16,000 union workers struck the company
in November, and Caterpillar subsequently locked out an
additional about 5,600. When it called the locked-out workers
back last weekend, they instead joined the strike.
   Following the UAW's rejection of the company's latest
proposal, Caterpillar said, it "informed the union that the
offer made {yesterday} is the company's final offer."
   Union officials weren't available for comment late
yesterday evening.
