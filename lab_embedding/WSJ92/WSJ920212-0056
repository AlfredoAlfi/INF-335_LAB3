Business Brief -- Applied Materials Inc.:
   Net Income Increased 51%
   In Firm's Fiscal 1st Period
New orders hit a record $219 million during the quarter,
and the company's backlog rose to $265 million, largely
because of demand for machines that make eight-inch wafers of
advanced design. Gross margins declined slightly, in part
because of recent changes in the company's product mix. But
that decline was offset by lower relative operating expenses,
the company said.
   In national over-the-counter trading, the company's stock
was quoted at $36.75, down 75 cents a share.
