Letters to the Editor:
   Hiring by Quotas Is a Shot in the Head
In addition, Mr. Carson's proposal has some disturbing
managerial implications. The highest performer in a given
"minority" group might be a poorer performer than the poorest
performer in the "majority" group or even in another
"minority" group. I wonder if Mr. Carson has talked to some
of the managers in the high-tech industries in our Phoenix
area or to the managers at the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating
Plant as to the effects of his proposal?
   Finally, he has neglected, completely, the rise in
litigation costs that would probably accompany his proposal
if adopted. The assignment of quotas is fraught with legal
difficulty. Hispanics, for example, constitute the highest
percentage of "minority" groups in the Phoenix and Tucson
areas, with the percentage being much higher in the latter
area. Is the quota for Hispanics to be assigned on the
percentage in the local area, the state area, the national
area? Or where? In sum, the law might have shot itself in the
foot, but it deserves to be shot in the head, along with Mr.
Carson's proposal.
