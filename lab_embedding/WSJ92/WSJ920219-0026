Business Brief -- Greyhound Lines Inc.:
   Unit of Dial Corp. Receives
   Order for 101 New Buses
The company also said that another Dial unit had agreed to
buy 636 buses currently in Greyhound's reserve fleet. The
price wasn't disclosed.
   The Motor Coach order marks Greyhound's first purchase of
new buses since 1988, when the company began concentrating on
refurbishing old buses instead of annually replacing part of
its fleet. While that strategy cut capital costs, it also led
to rising maintenance expenses.
