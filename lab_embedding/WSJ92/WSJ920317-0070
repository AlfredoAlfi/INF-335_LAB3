Business Brief -- Nova Corp. of Alberta:
   Firm Says It Plans to Close
   Resin Plant in Massachusetts
The Leominster plant has an annual capacity of 120 million
pounds, Nova said, but due to market conditions has been
producing only 80 million to 90 million pounds of polystyrene
resin a year. The closing, set for August, will put 60 Nova
employees out of work and reduce the company's total
polystyrene resin capacity to 630 million pounds annually.
   Nova, based in Calgary, Alberta, said the closing won't
have any impact on the company since it made provision for
plant closings as part of a restructuring charge against its
1991 earnings.
