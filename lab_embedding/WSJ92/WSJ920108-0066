Sprouse-Reitz Stores Inc.
Inquiries about its acquisition, Sprouse said, were
primarily from "persons who had expressed an interest in
acquiring the company in the past," including Robert H.
Bisno, chief executive officer of TransAction Cos., Oakland,
Calif. The company said it had not entered into negotiations
with any party, and noted any such sale requires approval by
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
