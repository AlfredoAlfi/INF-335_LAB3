Who's News:
   Simmons Will Resign
   His Post as President
   Of Jordan Marsh Chain
Allied Stores is a retail unit of Campeau Corp., Toronto.
   According to a statement issued by Allied, Mr. Simmons's
resignation "was not unexpected." Mr. Simmons declined to
return phone calls.
   Last Jan. 10, Richard F. Van Pelt resigned as chairman of
Jordan Marsh after serving about two years in the job. He was
succeeded by retailer Harold Frank, who will now assume Mr.
Simmons's responsibilities. Although Allied's traditional
department-store structure calls for a chairman to oversee
merchandising and a president to be responsible for
operations, there aren't any plans to name a successor to Mr.
Simmons.
