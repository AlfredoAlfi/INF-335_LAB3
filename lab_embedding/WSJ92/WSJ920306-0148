Notable  Quotable
How eerily silent in the face of this catastrophe is the
Sovietological community which for years has been assuring
the world that the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc were
solid and popular and, for all their obvious shortcomings,
able to teach us a thing or two about social justice. What
thoughts cross the mind of the "revisionist" historians who
depicted Lenin as the leader of a genuine popular revolution
and the father of his country, as they look at photographs
showing his monuments razed by furious, truly revolutionary
crowds and his severed head dangling from the wrecker's
noose?
