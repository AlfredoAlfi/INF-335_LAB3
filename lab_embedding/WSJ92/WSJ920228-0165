   CBS in Albertville:
   A Lot of Dull Chatter
I suspect that CBS has been churning out the mindless
drivel of sitcoms, game shows and soaps for so long that when
it gets its hands on the Olympics it doesn't know what to do
with them. What it needs to do is cut out all the chatter,
the set pieces and show what anyone who tunes in to the
Olympics wants to see: world-class athletes in action.
