Technology:
   Former Computer
   Associates Employee
   Ordered to Stop Sales
Judge Spatt found ADT's product to have copied trade
secrets -- including formulas, equations and overall
architecture -- of CA-Estimacs, Computer Associates' software
product that enables users to estimate the effort, cost,
duration and staffing required for developing specific
software. CA-Estimacs, introduced in 1985, and a related
product, Planmac, had sales of $17 million through 1990,
Computer Associates said.
   Mr. Bryan said the judge's decision "sustained only some,
not all, of the trade secrets claimed by Computer
Associates," adding that "the decision was flawed in several
material respects and illustrates the difficulties that
laymen have in comprehending complex computer issues." He
said he remains confident that a trial will vindicate ADT.
   Mr. Bryan had worked for Computer Associates from 1982 to
1989 in various positions, including marketing manager for
CA-Estimacs. His company began selling AD/TEC-SYS in the fall
of 1990.
