Some Japan Auto Concerns
   Hit Back in War of Words
Accepting the award for Lexus's SC 400 model, Mr.
Illingworth praised the 1992 domestic Car of the Year,
General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac Seville. Then he added:
"Without Lexus, the Seville wouldn't be the car it is today.
The benefits of competition are overlooked in all the calls
for protection. Restrict competition, and you take away the
incentive to improve," he said.
   Mr. Illingworth's remarks reflect an emerging strategy
among Japanese auto makers to counter the increasingly
strident anti-Japanese rhetoric from some members of Congress
and Detroit's Big Three auto makers.
   One part of the strategy: Highlight the thousands of jobs
created by Japanese auto companies in the U.S. at assembly
plants, parts companies and dealerships. Today, Mazda Motor
Corp is expected to announce that its redesigned 626 sedan
will meet the criteria to be officially classified as a
U.S.-made car. The 626 is built at Mazda's Flat Rock, Mich.,
assembly plant and will have more than 75% U.S. content.
   Japanese auto makers also are pointedly reminding American
consumers of what it was like before competition pushed
Detroit to improve quality.
