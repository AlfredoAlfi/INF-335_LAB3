Law:
   Ex-Italian Bank Employees
   In Atlanta Plead Guilty
According to the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, the pair was
involved in issuing more than $5 billion in loans and credit
commitments for the benefit of the government of Iraq. Those
loans and credits violated U.S. and Italian lending limits
and weren't properly recorded by the Atlanta branch,
according to the original indictment.
   Of the total, about $1.8 billion in loans were guaranteed
by the Agriculture Department under its commodity export
credit programs.
   Ms. Barden and Mr. Decarolis each face a possible maximum
sentence of 10 years in jail, a $500,000 fine, and $1.8
billion in restitution. Sentencing is scheduled for after the
trial of Christopher Drogoul, former manager of the Atlanta
branch. That proceeding is set to begin in federal court here
June 1.
