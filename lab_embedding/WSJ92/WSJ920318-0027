   Dillard Declares
   3-for-1 Stock Split;
   Share Price Jumps
The fast-growing department-store retailer said the split
is contingent upon shareholders approving a doubling of the
number of authorized common shares outstanding at the annual
meeting May 16. If the increase is approved, the additional
shares would be distributed to stockholders of record May 22.
   In its 1991 proxy statement, Dillard said it had about 36
million Class A and 1.3 million Class B common shares
outstanding. The Class B stock, 99% of which is owned by the
founding Dillard family, holds the votes to two-thirds of the
company's board.
   Analysts welcomed the move. "Analysts such as myself who
have both an institutional and a retail following have been
urging Dillard to do this for a long time, to make the stock
more attractive to individuals," said Dennis C. Van Zelfden,
of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas.
   Dillard also declared a quarterly dividend of six cents a
share on its Class A and Class B stock, payable May 1 to
stockholders of record March 31.
   Dillard's net income in the fiscal year ended Feb. 1 rose
13% to $206.2 million, or $5.53 a share, from $182.8 million,
or $5.01 a share, in fiscal 1991. Sales rose 12% to $4.04
billion from $3.61 billion.
