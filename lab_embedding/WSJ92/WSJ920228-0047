San Miguel's Profit
   Increased 57% in 1991
   On Improved Margins

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The company said the rise in earnings resulted from
improved margins and the effects of its streamlining measures
and expansion and modernization program.
   "Last year's results validate the strategies we are
pursuing and demonstrate the soundness of our businesses even
during difficult times," said Andres Soriano III, San
Miguel's chairman.
   While sales in monetary terms grew 22% to 53.3 billion
pesos from 43.8 billion pesos, the company said, sales volume
declined because of low demand resulting from the economic
slowdown.
   A tax increase on beer further damped demand for San
Miguel's flagship product.
   Of the 1991 profit, 437 million pesos was paid to
shareholders as cash dividends, and 2.38 billion pesos was
reinvested for the expansion and modernization program. That
program involved a total of 4.17 billion pesos in capital
expenditures in 1991.
   San Miguel said it is "cautiously optimistic" about its
prospects for 1992 and beyond, citing an expected
acceleration of government infrastructure projects, lower
inflation and interest rates, a scheduled phase-out of an
import levy and foreign exchange liberalization.
