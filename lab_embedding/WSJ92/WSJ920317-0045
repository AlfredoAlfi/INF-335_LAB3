Business Brief -- Gottschalks Inc.:
   Retailer to Buy Five Stores
   From Frederick  Nelson
Gottschalks reported last month it signed a letter of
intent to buy six stores from Frederick  Nelson, which filed
for reorganization under the federal Bankruptcy Code last
September. Gottschalks said the Seattle company found another
buyer for the sixth store.
   Under the proposed agreement, the sale would be closed May
31 after approval from creditors and the federal bankruptcy
court.
   Gottschalks said it expects to be operating all the stores
by early fall.
