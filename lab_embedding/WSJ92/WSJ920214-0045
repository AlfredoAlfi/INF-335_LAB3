New York Legislation Woos
   Operators of Credit Cards
Under the legislation, banks with credit-card operations
in New York will be allowed to immediately assess a fee to
cardholders who are late in paying their card bills. Under
the current law, banks have to wait at least 10 days before
charging late fees.
   In addition, the bill would eliminate the requirement of a
30 days' notice for interest-rate changes and would forbid
consumers from canceling their credit cards and paying off
their debt at the old rate.
