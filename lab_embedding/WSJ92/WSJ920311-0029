International Brief -- Au Printemps S.A.:
   Appeal to Force 100% Bid
   For Company Is Rejected
Pinault S.A., a wood products and distribution group, had
acquired the controlling block for 3.3 billion French francs
($584.4 million) from the Maus family of Switzerland in
November. Under French law, if a buyer acquires over 50% of
the voting rights of a company, he must bid for 100% of the
company. But if he falls under this threshold, he must bid
for only two-thirds of the target.
   Pinault acknowledged that he constructed the transaction
to make double voting rights revert to single voting rights,
thereby remaining below the 50% threshold. But he insisted it
was done in full compliance with the law.
   Georges Berlioz, an attorney for the minority
shareholders, said he intends to appeal the decision to the
Court de Cassasation, the next level with jurisdiction to
reverse the appeals court decision.
