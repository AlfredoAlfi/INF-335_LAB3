Business Brief -- La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.:
   Group Seeking Authority
   To Call Special Meeting
Philip G. Nappo III, one of the principals of the
dissident investor group, said the effort to call a special
meeting will proceed along with the proposed exchange
offering. Under the partnership agreement governing La
Quinta, only 25% of the units oustanding need to be obtained
to call a special meeting, the investor group said.
   "Both initiatives, in our opinion, are designed to restore
the lost balance between investor returns and management
compensation," Mr. Nappo said.
   Alan Tallis, president of La Quinta Realty Corp., wouldn't
comment on the group's action.
