"This is the first quarterly increase in sales in a year,"
said Victor Zaccaglin, chairman and chief executive officer.
"We believe it reflects both a modest firming of the market
as interest rates have dropped, and the success of
repositioning our product mix to respond to market
pressures."
   For the year, Calprop's loss widened to $12.2 million, or
$2.63 a share, from $11.7 million, or $2.52 a share. Revenue
fell 28% to $26.3 million from $36.7 million.
