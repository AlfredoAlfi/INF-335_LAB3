Business Brief -- Hemlo Gold Mines Inc.:
   Firm Sets $22.6 Million
   Charge Against Earnings
Most analysts had expected the Toronto-based gold-mining
concern to write down some of its holdings. On the Toronto
Stock Exchange, Hemlo shares were quoted late Friday at C$11,
down 37.5 Canadian cents.
   Mr. Bayer said the largest part of the charge, about C$12
million, relates to the write-down of Hemlo's interest in an
Ontario gold property, in which Hemlo had invested C$20
million. Although the property could be mined at a small
profit, Mr. Bayer said Hemlo will wait until gold prices pick
up before proceeding. The Eagle River property contains an
estimated 500,000 ounces of gold, worth roughly US$180
million at current prices. Hemlo itself produced some 450,000
ounces of gold last year.
   Of the charge, C$8 million stems from a loss on the sale
of an investment.
