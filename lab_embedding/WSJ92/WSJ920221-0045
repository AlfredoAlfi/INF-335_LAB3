Business Brief -- Nynex Corp.:
   Restructuring Plan of Unit
   Is Accepted in New York
Both federal and state regulators were alarmed two years
ago when a federal audit turned up $118 million in
overcharges paid by Nynex's New York Telephone and New
England Telephone units to a now-defunct central purchasing
arm. The restructuring plan is designed to prevent the
company from using ratepayer money to support Nynex's
non-telephone businesses.
   The commission suspended a planned investigation of New
York Telephone. The commission also directed its staff to
make sure the restructuring plan accomplishes its goals of
protecting consumers.
