Judge Refuses to Bar
   Tecnol From Buying
   More Shares of Anago
The two companies reached a standstill pact last week,
under which Tecnol stopped buying Anago shares pending Judge
Sanders' ruling in a suit filed Feb. 10 by Anago. The suit
followed Tecnol's Feb. 7 announcement it intended to acquire
Anago for $14 million, including the price of shares already
held by Tecnol.
   Tecnol's chief operating officer, David Radunsky said the
company will now pursue the acquisition.
   In addition to dismissing Anago's antitrust claim, Judge
Sanders ruled that Tecnol hadn't made a tender offer for
Anago stock but had approached "only a small portion" of
Anago's shareholders. The judge said that Tecnol has
contacted 10 of the 80 or 90 holders of Anago's stock, and "a
number" of those 10 have agreed to sell their stock.
