Business Brief -- Van Dorn Co.:
   Crown Cork Bid Is Rejected
   And New Holder Plan Set
Under the new plan, shareholders may purchase Van Dorn
common at 50 cents a share whenever any person or group
acquires 20% of the shares outstanding. Previously, the
threshold was 25%.
   Also, Van Dorn's outside directors may reduce the
threshold to 10%, if they think the person or group acquiring
the shares could have an "adverse impact on the company," Van
Dorn said.
   W.G. Pryor, Van Dorn's president and chief executive
officer, said the Van Dorn board concluded that "shareholders
are best served by keeping Van Dorn independent."
