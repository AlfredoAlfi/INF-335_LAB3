   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Mr. Prestat said the decision for Mr. Isautier's departure
was made by the unit's shareholders.
   Under a government plan unveiled last month, Thomson
Consumer Electronics is due to be absorbed into CEA
Industrie, a profitable nuclear fuels concern. The plan aims
to make CEA Industrie carry some of Thomson's financial
burden for the development of high-definition television.
Thomson Consumer Electronics had a loss of 2.7 billion francs
($506.8 million) in 1990 and has debts of more than 10
billion francs.
   Thomson Consumer Electronics is a major international
consumer electronics concern. It is a market leader in the
U.S. and owns the RCA and General Electric television brands.
Its products include TV sets, TV tubes, videocassette
recorders, camcorders, compact disk players, radios and hi-fi
equipment.
