Union Carbide Plant Explosion
The incident caused "no release" of harmful chemicals into
the environment, according to a Union Carbide spokesman.
   "Equipment damage was minimal" at the specialty chemicals
plant, the company said, and operations haven't been
interrupted.
   A Union Carbide plant in Seadrift, Texas, suffered a much
more destructive blast in March 1991. In that case, the
company's production capacity in certain lines was sharply
curtailed, and the company incurred millions of dollars in
lost profits.
