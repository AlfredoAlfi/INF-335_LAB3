Marketing Brief -- Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc.:
   New Mexico Approves Use
   Of Firm's Electronic Books
Franklin said its devices are already being used in some
7,000 schools across the U.S., because some local school
districts have approved their use. A spokeswoman said the
most popular devices are Franklin's speaking dictionaries,
which pronounce the word that a student looks up and which
also contain a thesaurus and a spelling checker.
   Electronic books, initially a novelty, have started to
catch on largely because it can be much easier to have the
computer search for a topic or string of words than to do it
manually. The books are expected to become more popular as
improvements in computer-chip technology increase the speed
of the search and the memory capability of the books.
