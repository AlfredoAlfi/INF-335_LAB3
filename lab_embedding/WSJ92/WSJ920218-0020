Business Brief -- Belding Heminway Co.:
   Textile Firm Is Considering
   Putting Itself Up for Sale
Last fall, the company had laid out an aggressive
expansion plan. In particular, the company planned to expand
overseas, especially in Europe. The company, acknowledging
that its main textile business is mature, also talked of
having its overseas operations get into non-textile
businesses. Belding also has interests in consumer products,
real estate and cellular telephone operations.
   But the company apparently decided those efforts weren't
paying off fast enough because it said Friday that it "has
decided to explore alternatives available to maximize value
for its shareholders, including a possible merger or sale."
   For the first nine months of 1991, earnings fell 42% to
$1.5 million, or 78 cents a share, as revenue slipped 6.7% to
$105.7 million.
