Business Brief -- Egghead Inc.:
   Quarterly Net Declined 15%
   Despite 35% Sales Increase
Egghead, a retailer of personal computer software, said it
saw strong sales in both its retail, and corporate and
government groups. Despite the strong sales -- its highest
ever for a quarter -- Egghead's earnings were lower than a
year ago, because of higher income taxes. In addition, the
year-earlier period included a $1.4 million gain from an
insurance reimbursement.
   For the nine months Egghead posted net income of $11.5
million, or 67 cents a share, about even with year-earlier
net of $11.1 million, or 67 cents a share. Sales rose 31% to
$509.9 million from $389.6 million. However, the year-ago
period benefited from the use of tax-loss carry-forwards,
which allowed Egghead to pay far less taxes in that period
than in the current nine months.
   The company, which operated 182 retail stores at the
quarter's end, said it plans to open 20 to 40 new retail
stores in fiscal 1993, and five to 10 new corporate sales
offices.
