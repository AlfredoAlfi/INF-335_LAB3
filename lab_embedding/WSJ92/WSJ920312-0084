International Brief -- Standard Chartered PLC:
   British Bank Posts 37% Rise
   In Pretax Profit for 1991
The company's dividend was maintained at 20 pence a share.
The results and dividend were in line with market forecasts.
   Profit improved throughout most of the group, except for
U.K. operations, which were affected largely by a substantial
charge against troubled leisure and pubs concern Brent Walker
Group PLC in the first half. U.K. operations posted a loss of
#46.5 million against a #19.3 million profit a year earlier.
   Losses in the group's Australian and North American
operations narrowed in 1991. Australian units had pretax
losses of #11.8 million against #34.6 million, while North
America's losses narrowed to #8.5 million from #11.3 million.
   Bad-debt charges of #159.4 million, a decline of 9% from
1990, were focused largely around the U.K., where there were
#130.2 million in specific and general charges.
