International:
   Japan's EIE Forms
   Hotel Joint Venture
   With Four Seasons
Mr. Shibata said that details haven't been decided, but
that EIE will probably finance about 80% of the joint venture
with the Regent chain's assets. The two companies expect to
sign a formal agreement in June.
   The venture will help alleviate the costs of managing
Regent for EIE, which has been going through a restructuring
to reduce debt. After purchasing 30% of the luxury hotel
chain in 1986 for $30 million, the company last month bought
the rest of the management company, and has been actively
seeking partners.
   H. Roger Garland, executive vice-president of Four
Seasons, said the transactions will leave it with majority
ownership of only one of the 23 hotels it currently manages.
The change is in accord with the company's previously stated
desire to emphasize management over ownership.
