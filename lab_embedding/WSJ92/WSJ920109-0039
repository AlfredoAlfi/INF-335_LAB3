Marketing  Media:
   Television Advocacy Group
   Plans to Cease Operations
The law also requires broadcasters seeking license
renewals to demonstrate how they are serving the educational
and informational needs of children.
   Ms. Charren said, however, that "children's commercial
television is at least as bad as when we started, if not
worse, because the commercials that interrupt the show are so
much worse." She noted that other lobbying groups will carry
on ACT's work.
   Nonetheless, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), who wrote
the legislation limiting advertising on children's programs,
said Ms. Charren's decision to shutter the organization by
year end was "a severe setback in the fight for quality
programming."
   In its first step toward going out of business, ACT said
it donated $125,000 to the Harvard Graduate School of
Education to fund an ACT lecture series on children and the
media, and an annual ACT fellowship for graduate student
research in the field.
