International Brief -- Ing. C. Olivetti  C. S.p.A.:
   Work Force to Be Reduced
   By 3,000, Union Indicates
Yesterday, Olivetti management started a round of talks
with labor unions on its "industrial plan" for the current
year.
   Olivetti has planned the payroll cuts to reduce operating
costs and overcome the current crisis in the international
computer industry. Following several years of declining
earnings, Olivetti is expected to post a loss for 1991 for
the first time in 13 years.
   Mr. De Benedetti, who also is the group's controlling
shareholder, in November took over direct management control
and launched a major restructuring aimed at cutting operating
costs.
