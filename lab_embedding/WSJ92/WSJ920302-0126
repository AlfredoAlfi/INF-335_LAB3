Ex-Chief of CenTrust
   Is Indicted for Role
   In BCCI Conspiracy
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The goal of the conspiracy, according to the indictment,
was to make it appear that there was investor interest in
CenTrust at a time that regulators were investigating
allegations of false internal accounting by the thrift.
CenTrust eventually repurchased the securities for more than
BCCI had paid, the indictment said, and Mr. Pharaon allegedly
kept the difference of $331,500.
   CenTrust failed in 1990 and was placed in federal
receivership. Regulators have said that its collapse could
cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   The federal investigation of CenTrust is continuing,
prosecutors said. Mr. Paul was jailed last month on contempt
of court charges for refusing to turn over documents related
to the bank he once ran in flamboyant style.
   Mr. Pharaon is a Saudi businessman who was indicted last
year on racketeering charges, and his whereabouts are
unknown.
