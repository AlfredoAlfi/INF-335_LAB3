British Aerospace
   Posts a Pretax Loss
   For '91 as Expected
In October, British Aerospace predicted its pretax profit
before extraordinary items would be no less than #150
million. Analysts had anticipated that charges would drive
the results to a pretax loss of between #85 million and #100
million, but they were braced for further shocks as well.
   British Aerospace also stuck to another of its pledges --
to keep its dividend unchanged from a year earlier -- by
proposing a final dividend of 16.1 pence a share, bringing
the total dividend for 1991 to 25 pence a share.
   All of the company's major sectors were hit by recession,
prompting it to reorganize and cut almost 5,000 jobs. In
addition, a major rights issue was bungled, forcing
underwriters to take up 95% of the shares. Last week British
Aerospace announced it plans to cut a further 2,350 jobs.
   Still, the company's interim chairman, Sir Graham Day,
said the company is in "sound financial condition."
   Among other bright spots on the company's preliminary
report were its cash flow, its participation in the Airbus
consortium and especially its defense division, which managed
to boost its pretax profit to #553 million from #504 million
a year earlier.
