Noteholder Sues Units
   Of Lifetime Products
   For Missed Payments
Mr. Brackett initially sued Lifetime Automotive Products
last May, charging that it was late in making a payment to
him, a delay the company attributed to a clerical error. In
July, Lifetime Automotive reached a settlement with Mr.
Brackett, calling for it to pay him $800,000 and to pay the
remaining amount over two years.
   After Lifetime Automotive missed an Oct. 31 payment and
Tripledge missed a Nov. 30 payment on a $472,029 note, Mr.
Brackett sued the companies again in January. Mr. Brackett
agreed to withdraw the suit while Lifetime tried to negotiate
a credit line. Talks ended, however, and the lawsuit was
refiled this month. In the meantime, Mr. Brackett's lawsuit
charges, Ms. Runyeon and a company controlled by Mr. Fichtner
and his wife were granted security interests in substantially
all the assets of Lifetime Automotive, the company's main
operating unit.
   Patrick Stark, Lifetime's general counsel, said Lifetime
Automotive missed the payment because it didn't have the
funds available, a problem he attributed to the company's
rapid growth since 1990. He said Lifetime is trying to settle
the disputes with Mr. Brackett.
