Business Brief -- Digital Equipment Corp.:
   Computer Maker Confirms
   Plans for New Chip Plant
The spokesman said the plans were "preliminary" and didn't
represent a definitive capital spending plan.
   Digital has developed a new-generation microprocessor that
is expected to be the heart of most of its expensive
computers starting late this year. Digital has said it has
already produced the microprocessors at its existing plant.
However, mass production of new generations of chips usually
requires new facilities.
