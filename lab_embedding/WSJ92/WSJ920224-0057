Business Brief -- Alitalia S.p.A.:
   Preliminary Results Show
   Narrower Loss for Group
Alitalia said the sale and lease-back of 177 billion lire
of aircraft helped its bottom line. Analysts noted that while
the sale was technically an extraordinary gain, it is a
normal practice in the airline industry to help a company
improve results.
   Alitalia's board expressed "satisfaction" over last year's
preliminary results and predicted that the airline will
return to profitability this year after three years of
losses. Although Alitalia, the bulk of whose traffic is in
the Mediterranean area, suffered more from the Gulf War than
most other airlines, it recovered rapidly in the final three
quarters of last year. It said it limited the decline in its
passenger traffic to 4.6%, compared with an average drop of
6.2% for the companies belonging to the Association of
European Airlines.
