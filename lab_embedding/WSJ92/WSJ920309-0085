Who's News:
   R.H. Macy Says Sellers
   Resigned From Post
Prior to being named vice chairman of Macy's East, Mr.
Sellers, 40 years old, was president and chief operating
officer of Macy's South/Bullock's, based in Atlanta. Efforts
to reach Mr. Sellers were unsuccessful.
   The resignation of Mr. Sellers surprised some Macy
employees because he was believed close to Myron Ullman III,
Macy's vice chairman and chief operating officer of the
closely held company. In the early 1980s, Mr. Sellers and Mr.
Ullman worked at the former Sanger Harris division of
Federated Department Stores Inc.
