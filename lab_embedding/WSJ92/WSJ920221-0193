Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 41.9% involved
stock-index arbitrage, down from 50% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 43.7% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 35.3%
involved trading for customers. An additional 21% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities and Kidder Peabody.
