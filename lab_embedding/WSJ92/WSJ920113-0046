Business Brief -- Unilever Group:
   Chesebrough-Pond's Awarded
   Damages in Trademark Case
Chesebrough-Ponds also obtained a court order in the
trademark and patent infringement case that recalls some of
the copycat lotion bottles. The suit was filed in St. Louis
against four manufacturers and retailers of private-label
body lotion.
   The pale-yellow lotion was made by Benjamin Ansehl Co.,
St. Louis, and sold in yellow, blue, green and white plastic
bottles made by Kessler Containers Ltd., St. Louis, some of
which were labeled "Vaseline" and "Intensive Care." The
product was sold in May Department Stores, a St. Louis
retailer, and through May's Venture chain.
   Judge William L. Hungate found the lotion, bottles and
labels infringed on the trademark, tradedress and patent for
Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion. He also ordered the recall of
the infringing product and advertising.
