   Malaysia Posts Trade Surplus
The 1991 trade deficit seems likely to be the widest in
Malaysian history, an economist said. It will be the first
since 1982, when a M$915 million deficit was recorded. A
surge in import demand since 1989, combined with only
moderate growth in exports, has progressively weakened
Malaysia's balance of trade.
