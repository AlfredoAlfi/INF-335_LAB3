Four Doctors Accused
   Of Conspiring to Fix
   Fees Paid by HMOs
The Justice Department said it filed with a federal court
in Boston a proposed settlement of the antitrust charges
against three of the Massachusetts doctors and the
Massachusetts Allergy Society, a trade association that was
also named as a defendant. Charges are pending against the
fourth doctor.
   Under the settlement proposal, which requires court
approval, the defendants didn't admit to wrongdoing but
agreed not to attempt to fix prices in the future. Violation
of the settlement could result in civil fines.
