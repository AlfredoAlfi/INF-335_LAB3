Commonwealth Edison
   Is Blocked From Using
   Increase in Its Rates
At that time, the court sent the $750.2 million, or about
14%, increase back to the ICC for rehearing on certain
matters. The initial order didn't force the company to roll
back the 9% first installment of the increase, which
Commonwealth Edison put in place 11 months ago.
   The court's ruling yesterday was in response to a request
by a citizen group; the court denied the group's request to
roll back the first phase, however.
   On that basis, the ruling appears to lessen some concerns
that Commonwealth Edison's dividend might be jeopardized in
the near term.
   A Commonwealth Ed spokesman said that "we're hoping the
next ICC order will be similar to the one that it issued in
March of 1991, but at the same time find acceptance by the
Illinois Supreme Court." He said the commission is likely to
issue a new order, replacing its earlier increase, "this
summer at the earliest, and around year end by the latest."
   Because of that time frame, he said, the company's
inability to implement the third year of the earlier-approved
increase will be made "moot" by the ICC's expected action.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Commonwealth
Edison fell 87.5 cents to $36.875.
