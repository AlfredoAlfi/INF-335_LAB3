Cuba and Latvia Sign
   A Barter Agreement
   To Exchange Food
In Moscow, the Russian Information Agency said Latvia
would provide Cuba with beef fat, cheese and condensed milk
in exchange for 50,000 tons of sugar. Prensa Latina said
Latvia also will import Cuban citrus products.
   Cuban officials have been looking for trading partners to
replace the Soviet supply line that kept the island nation
going for more than 30 years. Like other ex-Soviet republics,
Latvia has no convertible currency.
