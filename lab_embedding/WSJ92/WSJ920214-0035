GM Asks Workers to Take
   2-Week Vacations in July
GM officials say the company could save about $200 million
a year if UAW members took their vacations during a
company-wide shutdown. That sum is how much GM could pay in
unemployment benefits if workers simply treat the shutdown as
a layoff, company officials say. So far, all but a handful of
UAW local leaders have refused to ask their members to take
vacations en masse during a scheduled two-week shutdown to
begin July 20.
   GM plant managers began sending letters directly to hourly
workers earlier this week, the spokesman said. "The letter
points out that we had a very bad year, and that a vacation
shutdown would help our overall competitive position," he
said.
   But a UAW official said yesterday the appeal could
backfire. UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich is "quite
annoyed," the official said.
