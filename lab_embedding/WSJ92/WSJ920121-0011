Business Brief:
   Bowater Net Fell 91%
   In Fourth Quarter;
   First Half `Uncertain'
Results don't include Great Northern Paper Inc., which was
acquired at the end of 1991 from Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   Anthony P. Gammie, chairman and chief executive, said
earnings so far in the first half are uncertain. "There is no
apparent pickup yet in the economy needed to improve
advertising demand in newspapers and directories and to
reverse the downward spiral of prices," he said.
   But he cited some encouraging signs, including an apparent
halt to the decline in newsprint consumption, and Canadian
manufacturers announcing the permanent closing of plants
representing more than 700,000 metric tons of noncompetitive
newsprint capacity. He also said market pulp prices bottomed
and have started improving. He said earnings won't improve
until price increases can be effected, particularly for
newsprint.
   If consumer confidence is restored, Mr. Gammie said
Bowater expects to see its businesses start showing
improvement by the second half of this year.
   For all of 1990, Bowater said net fell 41% to $45.6
million, or $1.15 a share, from $78.4 million, or $2.05 a
share. Sales slipped 6.7%, to $1.29 billion.
   In late New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bowater
was trading at $23.875, unchanged.
