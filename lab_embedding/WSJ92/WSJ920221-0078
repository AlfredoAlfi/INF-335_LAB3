Mr. McKinna previously was president of Granada Management
Corp., a Granada BioSciences affiliate, according to the
Associated Press.
   The disclosure follows Granada's sale of several U.S.
patents and applications, which cover the technology that
allows scientists to "clone" cows, to American Breeders
Service, a division of W.R. Grace  Co. Granada said it will
use proceeds from the sale to pay debts and operating
expenses.
   Separately, Granada said it and affiliated parties reached
a tentative settlement related to lawsuits filed by limited
partners in partnerships that were rolled up to create the
company. Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed, but
Granada said the claims will be paid by proceeds from
insurance policies held by affiliates.
   The troubled company hasn't reported year-end results, but
it had a net loss of $13.4 million, or $1.94 a share, for the
first nine months of 1991. The company has been selling
assets to pay debts.
