Business Brief -- Nuclear Support Services Inc.:
   Firm Says 2nd-Period Net
   To Be Below Expectations
The developments were outlined in a letter to NSSI
shareholders by Joe C. Quick, chairman, president and chief
executive officer. Mr. Quick said demand for the company's
services has been hampered by the current economic slowdown,
which directly affects utilities. He also said some nuclear
plants have moved back their planned power outages, when
demand is high for temporary services during refueling, into
late spring and summer, its next quarter.
