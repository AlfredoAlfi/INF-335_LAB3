Business Brief -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc.:
   Group Charges Retailer
   With Unfair Trade Practices
Wal-Mart President and Chief Executive Officer David Glass
sent a letter to manufacturers in November asking them to
work directly with the nation's largest retailer, rather than
using independent representatives to peddle their wares for a
commission.
   Federal antitrust laws prohibit companies from seeking
discounts by eliminating a broker's commission.
   The trade group said that since the letter went out, many
manufacturers' representatives have been unable to get
appointments with Wal-Mart buyers. A lawyer for the group
said that Ms. Steiger said her staff will look into the
matter.
   Officials at Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark.,
couldn't be reached for comment.
