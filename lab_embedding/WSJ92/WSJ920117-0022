International Brief -- Adidas AG:
   Rene Jaggi Plans to Resign
   As President at Year End
No elaboration was given for his decision and a successor
wasn't identified.
   Adidas was taken over by interests controlled by French
financier Bernard Tapie in 1990, and currently is majority
controlled by Bernard Tapie Finance G.m.b.H.
   British industrial group Pentland Group holds 20.05%,
while the French state-controlled bank Credit Lyonnais S.A.,
French insurer Assurances Generales de France and Banque
Worms together hold 19.95%.
   In its announcement, Adidas said that over the past couple
years, Mr. Jaggi turned around the fortunes of the poorly
performing Adidas of the late 1980s.
   Mr. Jaggi will continue to act as president throughout
1992.
   Without disclosing figures, the company also said it was
profitable last year, though earnings didn't reach budgeted
levels.
