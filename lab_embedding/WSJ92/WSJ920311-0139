Letters to the Editor:
   Discovery Bought
   Learning, Naturally
The Bob Magness, John C. Malone and TCI that I have come
to know are not as portrayed in your article. In 1986, when
no one else would risk investing in the Discovery Channel,
these gentlemen and their company bet on the intelligence of
the American viewer. TCI kept Discovery going with a
multimillion-dollar investment that was matched by Cox and
Newhouse. Because Messrs. Malone and Magness and TCI took
this gamble on behalf of their subscribers, the Discovery
Channel serves 56 million cable households today.
