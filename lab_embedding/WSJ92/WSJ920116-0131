Pepper...and Salt
Toward snow-accumulation forecasts
   My attitude is less than trusting;
   For I've spent some long, sweaty days
   Just shoveling off a light dusting.

   There are those who like to impress,
   And their image they like to hone.
   It is they who drive along
   Talking on a fake car phone.
