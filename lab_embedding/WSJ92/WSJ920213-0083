Agnico-Eagle Mines'
   Penna Receives Fine
   For Insider Trading
The Ontario Securities Commission said the penalty took
into account a variety of extenuating circumstances,
including Mr. Penna's "complete cooperation" with its
investigation and the fact that he didn't profit from buying
the stock.
   Mr. Penna's lawyer, Irwin Fefergrad, said the court could
have fined Mr. Penna as much as C$1 million and the OSC could
have forced him to give up his corporate offices and
directorships.
   In a separate decision, the Ontario Securities Commission
restricted Mr. Penna's right to sell shares in the open
market for a period of one year, except in certain
circumstances. It said Mr. Penna had accepted "ultimate
responsibility" for the previously reported purchase of
Agnico-Eagle shares by Mentor Exploration  Development Co.,
before Agnico-Eagle announced a gold discovery.
   Mr. Penna also is president of Mentor, a
mineral-exploration company, which at the time was 48% owned
by Agnico-Eagle.
