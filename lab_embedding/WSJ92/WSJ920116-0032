Business Brief:
   ATT Plans to Leave
   Current Headquarters
   In Midtown New York
About 450 marketing, advertising and public relations
employees will move to another midtown site, or to one of 53
other locations the company rents in New York. No more than
100 people are likely to be dismissed as a result of the
move, a spokesman said. They are mainly involved in the
maintenance and administration of the current ATT
headquarters building.
   ATT, as previously reported, will rent its current
headquarters to Sony Corp.'s Sony Music unit under a 20-year
lease with an option to buy signed last July. Designed by
architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee, the Madison Avenue
building has a Chippendale-style roof crown that has become a
distinctive element in the Manhattan skyline.
   The Avenue of the Americas building was opened in 1932 as
the headquarters of ATT Long Lines, the company's original
long-distance phone service.
