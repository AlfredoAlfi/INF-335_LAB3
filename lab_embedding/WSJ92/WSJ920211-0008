Business Brief -- Consolidated Rail Corp.:
   Firm Had $376 Million Loss
   In 4th Period After Charges
The loss, equal to $9.23 a share, compares with a profit
of $76 million, or $1.78 a share, in the 1990 fourth quarter.
Conrail had said in December that it would take the charges,
which included costs of shedding under-utilized rail lines
and an agreement with the United Transportation Union that
allows trains to operate with two-person rather than
three-person crews.
   Revenue in the quarter edged up to $847 million from $841
million.
   For all of 1991, Conrail posted a net loss of $207
million, or $5.39 a share, compared with a 1990 profit of
$247 million, or $5.10 a share. Revenue, however, slipped
3.6% to $3.25 billion from $3.37 billion.
