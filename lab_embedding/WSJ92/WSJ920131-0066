Technology:
   Cloning Chips Can Be an Expensive Feat
   ----
   By Stephen Kreider Yoder
Typical is Chips  Technologies Inc.'s three-year, $50
million project to reverse engineer Intel's 386 chip. To
avoid any question of impropriety, the company built an
engineering "clean room," with special locks to keep out all
but a small group of authorized engineers.
   Chips  Technologies barred former Intel employees from
the team. The "clean" engineers weren't allowed to look
inside the Intel chip. Instead, they noted how Intel's chip
responded to external software commands, then worked backward
to create circuits that generate exactly the same responses.
The result was a line of chips, unveiled last September, that
the company says will run faster than Intel's without
infringing on any rights.
   Advanced Micro Devices Inc. had an easier job cloning
Intel's chips. The company has the rights to many Intel
patents, and its clones use Intel-copyrighted software called
microcode that is built into Intel's chips. While other
cloners must write their own microcode, AMD says a 1976
agreement gives it rights to Intel's microcode; Intel
disagrees and has sued.
