Letters to the Editor:
   Politics Can Pollute
   Environmental Policy
Certain exempted businesses in the U.S. often reap
benefits from regulations that hinder their competitors. Such
problems would be magnified in a country like Mexico, where
bureaucrats are not as insulated against bribery and
corruption. Worse, ill-conceived environmental laws and
regulations would penalize foreign investment stimulated by
the NAFTA, and could be used as a surrogate for trade
protectionism. We should hope that Mexican prosperity does
not result in heightened calls for political management of
the environment.
