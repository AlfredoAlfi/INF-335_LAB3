   GM Recall: The Years
   Of Living Dangerously
The GM stalling problem was common knowledge long ago to
GM car owners, GM dealers, nonaffiliated repair shops and to
just about everyone, it seems, except GM Chairman Robert C.
Stempel and his quality-control wizards back in Detroit. So
here we are in 1992 and our comedic GM spokesman says, "This
{the recall} is a sign to them that this is a company that
stands behind its products and maybe {consumers} should go
back to {GM dealers} for a new product." Ha]
