Futures Levy Denounced
John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry
Association, the industry's lobbying group, said a tax burden
would make U.S. futures trading less efficient. He said the
tax will drive people out of the U.S. futures markets and
into overseas markets in London, Paris and Tokyo, which
already present a growing competitive threat to U.S. markets.
   Some of the larger futures exchanges also decried the
proposal. The Chicago Board of Trade's president, Thomas R.
Donovan, called the Bush administration "out of touch with
reality on this proposal." Both the CBOT and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange warned the tax could lead to job and tax
revenue losses.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange called the proposed tax
"deeply disturbing" because "our own government may be
responsible for enhancing the competitive advantage of
foreign exchanges."
