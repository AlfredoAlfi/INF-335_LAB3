First Savings Bancorp
   And Tristate to Merge
   In Exchange of Stock
The merger will involve a tax-free stock swap, with each
share outstanding of First Savings common stock to be
converted into 1.245 shares of TriState common stock. Each
share of TriState common will remain outstanding and will
represent one share of the merged holding company.
   Robert S. Johnson, current chairman of First Savings, will
become chairman of the merged holding company, while Laird L.
Lazelle, current president of TriState, will serve as
president.
   The new holding company will have assets of $400 million
and stockholders' equity of $38 million, based on figures
from Dec. 31, 1991. It will operate nine banking offices.
   First Savings said final approval of the merger will
require federal regulatory approvals as well as approval by
the shareholders of the two thrift holding companies. The
merger is expected to be approved before the end of 1992.
