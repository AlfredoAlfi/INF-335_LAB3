Business Brief -- Ashland Oil Inc.:
   Earnings Were $29.5 Million
   In the Fiscal First Quarter
The Ashland, Ky., company said it was pleased with record
results for the quarter ended Dec. 31 from Valvoline and
Ashland Coal Inc., as well as strong results from Ashland
Chemical and Ashland Exploration.
   However, the energy concern noted that refinery margins
fell sharply in December as petroleum product prices fell
faster than crude oil costs. Ashland said soft demand and
market fears of a growing crude oil surplus should Iraq
succeed in re-entering the market led to an industrywide
selloff, and wholesale product prices plunged. This resulted
in a $4 million operating loss for Ashland Petroleum Co., the
company said.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Ashland Oil
fell $1.375 to $30.875.
