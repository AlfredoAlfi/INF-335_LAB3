Marketing Brief -- Time Warner Inc.:
   HBO Unit Expands Push
   Into Original Programming
HBO, owned by Time Warner Inc., grew into a huge
pay-television service by acquiring major theatrical movies.
But in recent years it has increasingly offered original
films and series to bolster its ratings and prestige. "Dream
On," a weekly comedy in its third season, won five cable
awards in 1991, and "The Josephine Baker Story" won Emmy
Awards for its director and star.
   Last month, HBO said its new production unit for
programming that airs elsewhere, HBO Independent Productions,
would produce and premiere two half-hour comedy specials that
will then air as pilots on the ABC and Fox networks. The
unit's first network series, "Roc," made its debut on Fox
last August.
