Integrated Resources
   Gets Steinhardt Bid
   For the Firm's Assets
Last week Integrated announced an agreement with the real
estate arm of the Pritzker family of Chicago for almost $600
million. It's unclear which bid is more valuable to creditors
because the bids don't cover all of the same assets, a person
close to the negotiations said.
   The company is lining up both bids simultaneously to
obtain the highest recovery to creditors of $2 billion in
debt. It will seek bankruptcy court approval on March 31 to
proceed with both bids. Both potential transactions are
subject to many conditions. Once Integrated chooses one of
the bidders and reaches a definitive agreement, it will again
seek bankruptcy court approval.
   Steinhardt Management also reserves the right to begin a
tender for outstanding senior and subordinated obligations at
prices of at least 38 cents to the dollar of senior debt and
five cents per dollar of subordinated debt.
