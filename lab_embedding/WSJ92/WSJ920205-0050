Business Brief:
   Control Data Posts
   $15.2 Million Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
The latest quarter included net restructuring charges of
$17.5 million, primarily for severance pay and facilities
costs associated with downsizing the computer products
business. Results also suffered because the Russian Republic
failed to find financing for a $36 million mainframe computer
system it plans to buy. Moreover, the Automated Wagering
business suffered a loss because of declining lottery ticket
sales nationwide.
   Lawrence Perlman, chief executive officer, said he expects
the first half of 1992 to be difficult as well, because
computer sales are typically flat during the period and
because "we've not seen any indications of improvement" in
the U.S. economy.
   For all of 1991, Control Data reported a net loss of $9.8
million, or 24 cents a share, including an extraordinary
charge of $1.2 million, on revenue of $1.52 billion. In 1990,
net income was $2.7 million, or 5 cents a share, on revenue
of $1.69 billion.
