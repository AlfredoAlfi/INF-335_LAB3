But the Fed governor warned against adopting "quick fix"
solutions to get the recovery going again by boosting
consumers spending.
   "If we were to get our economy going again by
force-feeding consumer spending or reigniting financial
speculation, without reorienting our national expenditure
pattern away from consumption and toward investment," Mr.
Kelley said, "we would then be setting ourselves up for a
severe collapse later in this decade which would be deep and
long lasting."
