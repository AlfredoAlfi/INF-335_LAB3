CoreStates Financial
   To Buy First Peoples
   In $105.5 Million Pact
CoreStates said it thinks it can achieve cost savings
equal to one-third of First Peoples' expenses, mainly because
there is so much overlap in their branch systems. CoreStates
did say the acquisition will hurt earnings in the quarter
during which it closes, because the company will record
significant expenses related to the consolidation. The
closing is expected to come this summer.
   As a precaution against any problems that might develop
before the closing, the companies said First Peoples also
granted CoreStates an option to buy as much as 19.9% of First
Peoples stock.
   First Peoples, Haddon Township, N.J., has $1.1 billion in
assets. It had earnings of $8.1 million, or $3.17 a share,
last year. CoreStates earned $228.1 million, or $4.19 a
share. It had total assets of $21.6 billion at Dec. 31.
