International Brief -- Fermenta AB:
   Firm Halts Trading as Loss
   Erodes Equity of Its Unit
Independent, in a separate statement, disclosed that
higher than expected losses from operations during the final
four months of 1991 may have wiped out more than half its
remaining shareholders' funds. Under such circumstances,
Swedish law stipulates that directors order a special audit
to assess the company's actual financial condition.
   Independent said it plans to begin immediate talks with a
consortium of banks which last year agreed to a 4 billion
Swedish kronor ($685 million) financing commitment valid
through April 1993.
   Independent was one of a spate of so-called finance
companies plunged into acute liquidity problems by the
collapse of Sweden's commercial paper market in late 1990.
