Business Brief --  Home Federal Savings Bank:
   First-Period $800,000 Gain
   Expected on Securities Sale
However, in the short term, the sales will reduce its
interest rate spread, or the difference between what it
receives in interest and what it must pay, and could reduce
its profit.
   Home Federal said that it agreed to sell about $21.3
million in securities with an average coupon rate of 8.34% at
a premium of about 103.5%. It also said it expects to sell
its remaining $8.4 million in fixed-rate mortgage-backed
securities, with an average coupon rate of 8.61%, sometime
during the first quarter.
   For the first quarter last year, it had net income of
$85,000, or 16 cents a share.
