Business Brief -- Boise Cascade Corp.:
   Firm Expects a Loss, Plans
   Depositary Share Offering
The forest products company, which has been hurt by low
paper and pulp prices, and poor demand for wood products,
also said it filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for an offering of seven
million depositary shares. Proceeds of the offering would be
used to reduce Boise's debt, which totals about $2.2 billion.
   Pending SEC approval, each depositary share will
automatically convert into one share of the company's common
stock after three years and can be called by the company at
any time. The initial public offering price of depositary
shares is expected to be based on the company's common stock
price at the time the offering is made. In Big Board trading,
Boise closed at $21, down $1.875.
