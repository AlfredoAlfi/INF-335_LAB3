Business Brief -- Brother Industries Ltd.:
   Firm's Group Pretax Profits
   For Fiscal Year Rose 7.8%
A more than sixfold surge in net profit, to 1.94 billion
yen from 320 million yen in the previous fiscal year, was
exaggerated by extraordinary gains that reflected the sale of
parent company land in central Tokyo for 1.9 billion yen.
   The company blamed net losses of 2 billion yen in Europe
on sluggish economies in the region. For 1992, the company
expects to eliminate losses in Europe and break even, the
spokesman said.
   Brother Industries didn't predict specific numbers for
sales and earnings on a consolidated basis for the fiscal
year ending Nov. 20, 1992. But it aims to keep group sales
flat or above the levels of the year just ended, a spokesman
said.
