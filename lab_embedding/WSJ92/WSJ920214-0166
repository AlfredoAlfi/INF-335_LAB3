GPA Continues Talks
   On Stock Flotation;
   Denies Timing Is Set
"No decisions have been taken," said Richard O'Toole, GPA
managing director of corporate affairs.
   The GPA flotation is expected to be split evenly among the
London, New York and Tokyo stock exchanges, with perhaps half
the float raising new equity.
   Although GPA is widely rumored to be seeking to float the
shares in the first half of this year, Mr. O'Toole dismissed
the rumors as speculation.
   Press reports have also fueled rumors of a dispute between
the company and its bankers over the pricing of the public
shares. GPA Executive Chairman Tony Ryan is said to be
seeking a $30-a-share price, while some of the company's
bankers have reportedly recommended a price of about $20 a
share.
   On Tuesday, GPA announced its net profit for the fiscal
third quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 32% to $73.1 million. In its
announcement, GPA gave no hint on the timing of the
flotation.
