outlined last year in conjunction with the budget for the

province could face a deficit for the next fiscal year,
beginning April 1, of 14.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$12.37

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it expects to review
the province's debt rating after the release this spring of
the budget for the coming fiscal year.
   The debt of Ontario Hydro is guaranteed by the provincial
government.
