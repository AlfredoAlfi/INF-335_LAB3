Marketing  Media:
   Anheuser Is Planning
   To Increase Spending
   For Marketing in '92
Anheuser executive vice president Jerry E. Ritter
disclosed the marketing plans in a briefing of the Consumer
Analysts Group of New York meeting here. For the first time
in years, reporters were denied access to the meeting, at
which nearly two dozen publicly traded companies will discuss
their businesses over the next three days.
   PaineWebber beverage analyst Emanuel Goldman said Mr.
Ritter indicated that most of the incremental spending would
go to support the Budweiser family of premium beers. The
company's ailing Michelob line of super-premium brews would
receive some additional support, he said.
   The analyst said Mr. Ritter also indicated that Anheuser
is counting on its beer business, both domestic and overseas,
as the company's primary growth vehicle. He added that the
executive all but ruled out significant expansions of its
food and theme-park entertainment businesses.
   Mr. Ritter reportedly told the analysts that Anheuser's
Eagle Snacks business is expected to break even for the first
time next year. The executive couldn't be reached for
comment.
