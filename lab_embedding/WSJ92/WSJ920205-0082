   Elf Aquitaine Says
   1991 Profits Fell 7.5%
   On Lower Crude Prices
The company said preliminary estimates show that group net
profit, after minority interests, fell to 9.8 billion French
francs ($1.8 billion) from 10.6 billion francs a year
earlier. The results included 900 million francs of
exceptional gains compared with 1.2 billion francs in 1990.
   Per-share earnings fell to 39.3 francs from 43.8 francs.
That includes a dilution caused by the issue of eight million
shares during a capital increase that accompanied Elf's new
listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Elf said that during the year, the average price of North
Sea Brent, the European benchmark crude oil, fell to $20 a
barrel from $23.70 a barrel in 1990.
