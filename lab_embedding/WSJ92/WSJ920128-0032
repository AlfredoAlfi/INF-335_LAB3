Retiree Health Benefits
   For UMW Are Threatened
A spokesman for the union said a cutoff in benefits would
result in "chaos in the coal fields." The situation might be
defused however, if the union and the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association succeed in getting passed federal
legislation that would support the retiree program with $230
million annually from an increase in coal taxes. The
legislation would also authorize a $140 million transfer from
the UMW's pension funds to the health program.
