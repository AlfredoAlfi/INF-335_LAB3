Letters to the Editor:
   We Can't Draw the Line
   On How to Draw Lines
We gave intense scrutiny to the North Carolina plan, in
large part because of its strange shapes. Notwithstanding the
ridicule of editorial writers, however, the plan received
uniform support from minority leaders throughout North
Carolina. Indeed, not a single black or Native American from
North Carolina or elsewhere asked us to object to the plan.
Despite its configuration, the plan does seem to provide
minority voters in North Carolina with the opportunity to
elect congressional representatives of their choice,
something they have been unable to do since the early 1900s.
Under those circumstances, we had no legal authority to
reject the plan simply because it failed an aesthetics test.
