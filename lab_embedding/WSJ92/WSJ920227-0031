Enterprise:
   IRS Chief Seeks
   More Compliance
   By Small Firms
In an internal memo from a discussion she had with the IRS
board when she took office less than a month ago, Ms.
Peterson said she was interested in helping taxpayers comply
through education or "another form of assistance."
   The new IRS chief also said she has made ethics within the
agency a high priority. In her memo, she emphasized that she
wants to know about "referrals made for unethical conduct and
corrective action taken."
   Ms. Peterson said that she is committed to remain in her
position for five years, providing President Bush is
re-elected. That would make her the first commissioner since
Roscoe Egger, who served from 1981 to 1986, to head the IRS
that long.
