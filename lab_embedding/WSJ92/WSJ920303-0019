Business Brief -- IMC Fertilizer Group Inc.:
   Gain of $21.4 Million Slated
   For Sale of Plant to Koch
Separately, IMC said it is taking a one-time charge of
$165 million for the cumulative effect of a recently adopted
change in accounting for income taxes.
   The one-time charge will be retroactively reflected in the
previously reported fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30,
1991, resulting in a downward revision in the quarter's
earnings to a loss of $145 million from net income of $20
million.
   IMC said that net earnings for the second quarter ended
Dec. 31 will be restated to $23.4 million, from $22.1
million, as a result of the accounting change.
   IMC, based in Northbrook, Ill., said there will be "no
cash flow impact," and the charge isn't expected to affect
its debt ratings.
