Payless Cashways Sale
   Of Up to $500 Million
   Of Stock Is Planned
A Payless spokeswoman said the company decided to go
public again because the stock market is strong and because
the drop in interest rates has made financing such a move
more affordable.
   The company is also encouraged by strong sales in its
stores, she said. January same-store sales rose about 17%,
compared with a year earlier, she said. Samestore sales
refers to sales at stores that had been open at least a year.
   Payless said it has applied to relist its common on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   As part of the plan, Payless announced a tender offer for
its $332.5 million outstanding of 14.5% senior subordinated
debentures due Nov. 1, 2000. The company said it is also
planning to repurchase through privately negotiated
transactions its 16.5% junior subordinated discount
debentures due Aug. 1, 2008.
   To raise funds for the moves, Payless said it plans to
issue as much as $200 million in senior subordinated notes
and to arrange a financing pact for as much as $450 million
with a group of banks led by Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce.
   Payless said it plans a public offering of $435 million to
$500 million of common. The company said it filed a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an offer of as many as 33.5 million shares, of
which 27 million would be offered in the U.S. and the rest
internationally.
   Payless said it is proposing an initial offering price of
$13 to $15 a share. It said the public offering will be
managed by Merrill Lynch  Co., Goldman, Sachs  Co. and
Piper, Jaffray  Hopwood Inc.
   Payless operates 195 building-materials stores in 26
states.
