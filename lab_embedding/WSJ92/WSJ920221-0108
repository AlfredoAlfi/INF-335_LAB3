Industrial Production in Sweden
For the full year, industrial production fell 8.6% from
1990's level, the biggest drop between two consecutive years
since 1940, SCB said.
   "All sectors showed decreased production in 1991 from
1990," the agency said. "In the heavy machinery and
engineering sector, production fell 10%."
   SCB noted the full-year comparisons are based on absolute
volumes of production, while other comparisons are seasonally
adjusted.
