Business Brief -- Bell Atlantic Corp.:
   Chesapeake  Potomac Unit
   Ordered to Cut Basic Rates
The commission contended that Bell Atlantic
inappropriately passes on to Chesapeake  Potomac outsized
corporate overhead costs.
   In response, Chesapeake  Potomac called the commission's
charges "insupportable." The phone company said its ownership
by Bell Atlantic gives it technical and financial support "at
the lowest possible cost."
