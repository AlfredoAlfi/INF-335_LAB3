Federated, Allied
   Record Slight Decline
   In Cash Flow Figures
Revenue for the five weeks was $1.14 billion, down 3.9%
from $1.19 billion a year earlier. On a same-store basis,
revenue was up 1.6%. The retailers said preliminary results
indicate that revenue in January increased 5.8% on a
same-store sales basis. Operating cash was described as
"running significantly ahead" of early 1991 levels.
   "We obviously are pleased with our preliminary results
from January, although we still are planning on the
assumption that consumer spending will remain sluggish
through the first half of the year," said Allen Questrom,
chairman and chief executive officer of Allied and Federated.
   When Federated and Allied are merged, the resulting
company will be known as Federated Department Stores Inc. It
will operate eight divisions with 223 stores.
