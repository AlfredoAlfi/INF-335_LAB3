New York City Panel
   Accuses Delta Air
   Of Discrimination
A Delta spokesman denied that the company took any
discriminatory actions against the Pan Am job applicants.
"That's simply not the case, and we think the commission will
agree with us." He said the company is responding to
individual complaints as the commission sends them to Delta.
   A commission spokesman said the employees, most of them
New York residents, alleged that some women were asked if
they took birth control pills and if they had had abortions.
Others were asked whether their parents were divorced, and
single women were asked about plans for marriage and about
their relationships with their boyfriends.
   A city ordinance prohibits bias on the basis of age,
disability, marital status and other categories. The
commission said Delta could be liable for civil penalties of
up to $250,000 for each illegal act, as well as compensatory
damages. And a city judge could order reinstatement of
employees.
   The commission said it expects to file 25 additional
complaints soon. The employees were in jobs ranging from
flight attendant and reservation agent to pilot, flight
engineer and dispatcher.
