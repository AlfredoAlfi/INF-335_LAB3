International:
   Germany to Forgive Half
   Of Poland's Official Debt
The ministry said its move was in line with an agreement
between Poland and the 16-nation Paris Club of government
creditors to waive at least half of the country's $33 billion
of official debt.
   Warsaw launched an ambitious economic reform program after
the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.
   "Poland was the first country among the former Communist
states in Central and Eastern Europe to start on the road to
democracy," the Finance Ministry said. "This partial
forgiveness should improve conditions for the success of
economic reform and allow punctual service of the remaining
debt."
   Meanwhile, Poland's center-right government faced
criticism yesterday over its plans to ease austerity, and a
top Solidarity politician called for a new ruling coalition
that would pursue free-market reform more effectively.
   Leaders of two pro-reform Solidarity parties virtually
accused the government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski of
cowardice in the face of public discontent with the results
of the reforms.
