   Upjohn Sues for Libel
   In U.K. Over Reports
   Criticial of Its Halcion
Another suit was filed against the Sunday Express
Newspaper, its editor and a reporter who wrote an article
about Halcion. The story ran in the newspaper's Oct. 6
edition.
   The BBC said it has received no writ as yet and cannot
make any further comment. However, people within the BBC say
that the organization would obviously stand by its program.
   Mr. Mangold couldn't be reached for comment.
   Upjohn said the other suit is against Dr. Ian Oswald, a
Scottish psychiatrist who made critical comments about Upjohn
and the drug in a Jan. 20 New York Times article. Upjohn said
the suit against Dr. Oswald was filed Friday. The Times is
not being sued.
   Dr. Oswald couldn't be reached for comment.
   The company said it filed the lawsuits to show "it is not
prepared to allow allegations attacking the company's
integrity to be published without challenge." Each of the
cases will be handled in England's High Court of Justice.
   Critics have contended that Halcion users have a higher
incidence of adverse reactions, including anxiety, aggressive
behavior and confusion, than users of similar drugs.
   Medical authorities in the U.K. last October banned the
use of Halcion. Upjohn is appealing the decision. The
highest-strength Halcion tablet was also temporarily banned
in France and Spain.
