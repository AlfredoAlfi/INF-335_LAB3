The tax-free transaction will be accounted for as a
pooling of interests.
   The acquisition, Charter One's third in a year and 13th
since 1980, is expected to be completed in four to six
months, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
   First American shareholders would receive 0.625 shares of
Charter One common stock for each First American share if the
average price of Charter One's stock during a 20-day trading
period before the consummation is between $25.75 and $32.50.
Based on Friday's close, the share price would be $19.06.
