Business Brief -- National Media Corp.:
   Company Expects to Report
   Loss in Latest Fiscal Year
The company said the estimated loss includes costs related
to the realignment of its U.S. operating units and resolving
outstanding legal issues. A spokesman said the legal issues
include a shareholder lawsuit alleging, among other things,
misleading earnings estimates, and a Federal Trade Commission
inquiry on infomercials, the program-length commercials that
look like regular programming.
   The meeting was adjourned to March 5 to consider a
proposal on adoption of a stock option plan for top
executives. The proposal authorizes options to buy as much as
two million common shares, or about 18% of the shares
outstanding. There weren't enough votes at the meeting to
pass the proposal, the company said.
