Business Brief -- Deere  Co.:
   Fiscal First-Quarter Deficit
   Narrowed to $19.9 Million
Revenue was $1.45 billion in the latest quarter,
essentially flat with the year-earlier $1.44 billion.
   Deere said the slimmer deficit it incurred was "due mainly
to more efficient operations and improved price
realiza-tion," and it noted that the improvement in its
results came "despite sales and production volumes which were
relatively unchanged from 1991's depressed first quarter."
   While production in the first quarter is normally low
because of seasonal factors, Deere said, "Weak retail demand
in all of our markets and our ongoing efforts to reduce
company and dealers' inventories resulted in even lower
volumes, having a particularly severe effect on our first
quarter results."
   Deere said its outlook for the remainder of the year
"remains uncertain," because "recessionary pressures and a
low level of customer confidence continue to affect markets
for our industrial and lawn and grounds care products." And
while North American agriculture's economic fundamentals
remain relatively strong, it said, "farmers' buying attitudes
appear cautious."
