Letters to the Editor:
   Up the Revolution]
   (In Education, That Is)
These education "experts" demonstrate conservative
thinking at its worst. They want to preserve the status quo
at any price, even to the detriment of poor children. Our
society must purge itself of these reactionary thinkers. Up
the revolution (in education)]
