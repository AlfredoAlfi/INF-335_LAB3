Business Brief -- Ehrlich Bober Financial Corp.:
   Proposed Offer for Minarad
   Put on Hold Due to Glitch
Ehrlich Bober shed its main, municipal bond business a few
years ago and has since been seeking another business to
operate. In December, the company agreed definitively to
acquire closely held Minarad in a stock swap in which Minarad
owners would receive 40% of Ehrlich Bober's 3.2 million
shares outstanding. Minarad makes infrared instruments.
   Ehrlich Bober shares plunged 25 cents each, to 37.5 cents,
in American Stock Exchange trading yesterday. Based on that
price, the acquisition of Minarad, with annual sales of
between $2 million and $3 million, would be valued at
$480,000.
