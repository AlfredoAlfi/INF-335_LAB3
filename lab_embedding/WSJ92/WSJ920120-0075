Economy:
   Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
The Federal Reserve Board this week publishes the Beige
Book, an assessment of the U.S. economy during December and
early January. The report monitored an economy "still showing
few signs of life," says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
C.J. Lawrence Inc. in New York.
   Among its highlights, the book will show manufacturing and
construction ailing, Mr. Yardeni says. Manufacturing, hot in
early summer, stagnated in autumn before slack demand knocked
it cold, Mr. Yardeni says.
   Residential construction has fared better of late, but
consumer reluctance to add debt has tempered its success.
December housing starts, also scheduled for release this
week, likely fell about 2% to a 1.05 million-unit annual
rate, Mr. Yardeni estimates. The Fed's interest rate cuts on
Dec. 20 likely came too late in the month to stimulate sales,
and in turn, starts, he says.
   Mr. Yardeni is optimistic about housing's future, however.
Lower rates have led to a surge in refinancing, he notes, and
probably "some pickup in actual purchases and construction of
new housing" as well.
   When will the economy truly recover? "Consumers will wait
until tax cuts are implemented," improving income, before
boosting spending, Mr. Yardeni says, roughly in mid-1992.
