   Learn From Keynes
   And We'll Prosper
Moreover, in periods when we followed Keynes advice, e.g.,
1962-1968, 1983-1988, the American economy prospered, and
real wages and productivity advanced at a much more rapid
rate vis-a-vis our economic performance in the periods
immediately before or after these booms, e.g., 1958-1961,
1969-1971, 1979-1982, 1989-1991. In these latter slow-growth,
semi-slump periods, fiscal and monetary policies were
deliberately designed for, in Prof. Blinder's language,
shaving off the peaks of prosperity that we had worked so
hard to achieve, rather than keeping us permanently in
prosperity.
   Clearly those who do not study history are bound to repeat
its errors. Unfortunately, many Americans suffer needlessly
because we haven't learned the lessons of history.
