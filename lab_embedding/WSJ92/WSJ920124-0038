Business Brief -- Tandem Computers Inc.:
   Firm Posts 1st-Quarter Loss
   After Restructuring Charge
Tandem said earlier this month that it would undertake a
restructuring program featuring employment reductions and
asset write-offs to help boost its slumping results. James G.
Treybig, chief executive officer and president, said the
company doesn't expect "relief in the short-term from the
slowdown affecting our industry." But he said Tandem remains
financially sound and should benefit substantially from the
cost savings resulting from the restructuring efforts.
