Bank Group Files to Force
   Arochem Into Bankruptcy
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
As previously reported, at least two of Arochem's former
officers are under federal criminal investigation for alleged
international wire fraud and embezzlement of company funds.
   Arthur Olick, an attorney with Anderson, Kill, Olick 
Oshinsky in New York and special counsel to the Arochem
board, is expected to recommend that Arochem, of Stamford,
not contest the bank action, said Edwin Wells, an Arochem
director.
   Chase and the other banks have indicated they want Arochem
to sell its refinery in Puerto Rico. Arochem meanwhile has
been in talks on a possible crude-oil processing deal that
could help the company, Arochem officials said.
