Letters to the Editor:
   We're All Guinea Pigs
   When We're on a Plane
Those of us who travel on the nation's commercial airlines
are totally at their mercy -- and we have precious little
clout. A test in which real people are injured is far more
dramatic and difficult to conceal (or rig) than a computer
simulation. Instead of decrying the use of human "guinea
pigs," you should be decrying the airlines' disregard for
their passengers' safety.
