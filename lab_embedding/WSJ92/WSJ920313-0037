   Ex-Pan Am Workers
   File $1.1 Billion Suit
   Against Delta Air
Filed in federal court in Manhattan, the suit also alleges
that Delta further breached its contract by failing to
fulfill additional promises to reduce Pan Am's losses.
   The suit, brought on behalf of employees who would have
worked for the new Pan Am, is the third such action taken
against Atlanta-based Delta. In January, Pan Am Corp., the
parent of the defunct airline, filed a $2.5 billion suit
against Delta, and one month earlier Pan Am's unsecured
creditors filed a similar suit also seeking $2.5 billion.
Both suits are still pending in federal bankruptcy court in
New York.
