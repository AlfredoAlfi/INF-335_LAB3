International Brief -- Nippon Mining Co.:
   Company Plans to Merge
   With Oil Distributor Kyodo
Terms weren't disclosed.
   As part of the merger plan, Nippon Mining, which has
interests in nonferrous metals and petroleum refining, will
spin off its metals section, which currently accounts for
about 33% of its total sales, and set up an independent unit,
President Tatsuo Nakamura said.
   Nippon Mining now owns 47.1% of Kyodo Oil, while two other
smaller-sized refiners, Fuji Oil Co. and Kashima Oil Co., own
most of the rest. Nippon Mining will be the remaining legal
entity.
   The merger could mark the beginning of a restructuring in
Japan's oil industry, which has suffered from an excess of
small companies that stayed in business with the help of
government protection.
   Nippon Mining, which has been losing money on some of its
expensive U.S. operations, will gain financial relief along
with access to a retail distribution system.
