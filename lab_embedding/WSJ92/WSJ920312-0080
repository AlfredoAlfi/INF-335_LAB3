Business Brief -- Chevron Corp.:
   Plan on Early Retirements
   Offered to 35,000 Workers
Chevron already took a $102 million charge in the fourth
quarter for anticipated reductions of about 2,000 employees.
That charge didn't include the work force at its Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery, where the company plans to eliminate 700 of
the current 1,900 jobs and shut one of its two crude oil
processing units.
   The revamped plan would, for example, offer an employee
with 15 years of service earning $45,500 a year a special
benefit of $29,025 above the regular retirement plan payment.
   A Chevron spokesman wouldn't say how many employees the
company thought might accept the plan. He said the change
demonstrates that Chevron is "quite serious about the need to
cut costs."
