Business Brief -- Unocal Corp.:
   WSGP Partners Discusses
   Acquisition of Truck Stops
Unocal, based in Los Angeles, retained First Boston Corp.
in early 1991 to help it sell the truck-stop network and its
Southeast petroleum marketing and distribution operations. A
Unocal spokesman said talks to sell the Southeast operations
to Louis Dreyfus Energy Corp. of Wilton, Conn., are still
under way.
   Mr. Parsky said WSGP Partners was interested in the
network because of its strong market position and good cash
flow. Unocal officials didn't break out earnings or revenue
for the unit.
