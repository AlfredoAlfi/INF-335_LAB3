Technology:
   Alkermes and Cortex
   Will Develop Drugs
   For Treating Strokes
The agreement calls for Alkermes to provide $4.5 million
in research and development funding to Cortex over a two-year
period, the company said. Alkermes added that Cortex could
receive as much as $10 million in payments as product
candidates proceed through trials.
   Alkermes also purchased 750,000 Cortex common shares for
$1.5 million and received warrants to purchase an additional
two million Cortex shares, one million shares at $3 a share
and one million shares at $7.50 a share, or for a total of
$10.5 million if the warrants are exercised.
   The agreement also gives Alkermes exclusive, world-wide
rights to make and market products resulting from the
collaboration. Cortex would receive royalties on product
sales.
   The collaboration is intended to combine drug candidates
developed at Cortex with techniques developed at Alkermes for
getting drugs to cross the "blood-brain barrier," a network
of tissues that blocks most molecules from entering the brain
from the blood. The Cortex drugs involved consist of three
classes of substances that block the action of calpain, an
enzyme thought to destroy nerve cells in a number of brain
disorders, Alkermes said.
