International:
   Russia, Facing Inflation,
   Plans Bigger Banknotes
He also said a banknote with a face value of 1,000 rubles,
roughly equivalent to the average Moscow monthly wage, will
be printed in April, but he didn't say when it will be
issued. The 200 ruble note is now the highest denomination in
wide circulation.
   The largest coin in circulation at present is one ruble,
worth about one cent at the Russian Central Bank's market
rate. Coins of five and 10 rubles are also available.
   The smallest coin is one kopek, worth one one-hundredth of
a ruble or about one one-hundredth of a cent.
   Mr. Voilukov said he couldn't rule out the possibility of
coins for 50 or 100 rubles or notes for 5,000 or 10,000
rubles being introduced later.
   "Nobody knows for sure right now what the situation will
be in a year, how economic reforms will evolve, whether they
will lead to runaway hyper-inflation," he said.
