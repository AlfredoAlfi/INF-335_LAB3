International Brief -- Scandinavian Airlines System:
   SAS to Acquire 51% Stake
   Of Rival Swedish Carrier
SAS agreed to sell an additional 1% stake in Linjeflyg,
guaranteeing SAS control.
   SAS and Bilspedition AB, a Scandinavian freight-moving
company, which owns 50% of Linjeflyg, refused to disclose
terms under which the 50% Linjeflyg stake would change hands.
But cash isn't involved, the companies said.
   Some analysts believe the government might move to block
the SAS purchase, or pursue alternative means of fostering
increased competition.
