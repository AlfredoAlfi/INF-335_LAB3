   Charge Card in Mexico
American Express now has 110,000 holders of its gold card
in Mexico out of a total of 450,000 American Express
cardholders in that country. American Express offers a
"co-branded" gold card in two other countries: with Sumitomo
Bank in Japan and with Lloyd's of London Bank in the U.K.
   "We believe there will be other opportunities in the
broadly defined area of financial servicies" in Mexico, said
Mr. Robinson. Mr. Hernandez indicated he hoped the two
concerns would have more joint announcements. Both executives
refrained from specifics. The U.S., Mexico and Canada are
currently negotiating a free-trade agreement that would open
up the financial-services market.
