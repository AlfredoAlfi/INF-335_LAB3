   Fraud by Securities Staff
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest commercial bank as well
as its predominant securities house, said that none of the
employees under investigation are securities traders.
However, securities support staff typically have access to
inside information affecting securities prices, including
large orders.
   The disclosure comes as Germany's loosely regulated
securities industry is bracing for a crackdown after a year
of closer scrutiny by the government and Frankfurt
prosecutors office. At the most recent count, 270 traders
were under investigation for tax evasion and
securities-related violations. Bonn is preparing new
legislation for tighter securities laws and tougher penalties
to enforce them.
   During the summer, Deutsche Bank fired an options trader,
and Dresdner Bank AG in September dismissed five employees in
its mark Eurobond department, including its director.
