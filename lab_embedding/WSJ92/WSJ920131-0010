Citibank, Depository
   Trust Warn of Scam
   With Recycled Bonds
Citibank issued a statement yesterday warning of the
fraudulent practice. Last month Depository Trust issued a
similar warning listing 41 different corporate bonds,
including three different issues of Shell Oil Co., a unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, and four of Dow Chemical Corp.
   Typically securities are destroyed some time after they
are canceled, but an unknown quantity of securities were not
destroyed and are now recirculating.
   The dollar amount of worthless bonds available for
fraudulent usage could not be determined, officials said.
Edward McGuire, corporate secretary at Depository Trust, said
"we asked our participants to keep their eyes open and we'll
do whatever we can to help spread the word."
   Citibank said law enforcement agencies are investigating
the matter. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Interpol,
the international police organization, have reportedly been
notified, one official said. A spokesman for the FBI had no
immediate comment. Citibank, Citicorp's flagship bank,
believes it has not redeemed any bonds or accepted any as
collateral, but has "become aware" that individuals have
tried to submit them.
