Technology:
   Bell Atlantic and Motorola
   To Test New Phone Service
The companies said the test of Motorola's Personal Phone
Service 800 and a new pocket-sized Personal Communicator
phone will begin late this year with at least 500 Pittsburgh
customers. Pricing has yet to be determined. Motorola is
based in Schaumburg, Ill.
   A similar test was announced in December by Southwestern
Bell Corp., St. Louis, and Japan's Matsushita Communication
Industrial Co., a unit of  Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co., the parent of Panasonic. Unlike the Bell
Atlantic-Motorola system, however, the Japanese phones
require customers to have two phone numbers: one for home and
the other for cellular service.
   The Motorola service uses a small base station in a
customer's home or office. Calls made and received over the
base station use the wireline network and are billed at a
substantially lower rates than cellular calls.
