Business Brief:
   Dial Reports a Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
   After Taking Charges
Revenue slipped 1.8% to $848.9 million from $865.2
million.
   For the year, Dial had a net loss of $57.6 million, or
$1.47 a share, after the charges, compared with net income of
$16.4 million, or 38 cents a share, in 1990. The 1990 net
income included a $100 million provision against discontinued
operations for the bankruptcy of Greyhound Lines, which was
sold in 1987 and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1990.
   Revenue climbed 1.4% to $3.57 billion from $3.52 billion.
   Under the spinoff plan, Dial shareholders would receive
one share of stock in a newly created company, GFC Financial
Corp., for each two shares of Dial they hold. GFC Financial
would include Dial's commercial finance companies and a
mortgage insurance business. The Securities and Exchange
Commission completed its review of the spinoff proxy
statement, which is currently being mailed to shareholders
for a special meeting on March 3, Dial said. Dial expects to
complete the transaction by March 18.
   Separately, Dial said it signed a contract valued at about
$25 million to manufacture 100 motor coaches for Taiwan's
public transportation system.
