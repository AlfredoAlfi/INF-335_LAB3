Marketing Brief -- Coca-Cola Co.:
   Joint Venture With Nestle
   To Announce U.S. Product
But last month, PepsiCo Inc. teamed up with Thomas J.
Lipton Co., the dominant player in the estimated $400 million
market for ready-to-drink teas. That move, analysts say,
pressured Coke to step up its own development plans.
"Everything is hastened because of the Pepsi-Lipton deal,"
said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles
beverage consulting company.
   Coca-Cola Nestle officials wouldn't discuss the product
announcement until today, a spokeswoman said.
