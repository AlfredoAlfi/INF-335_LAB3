   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Japan System is suffering from a slump in the mainframe
computer market and needs financial assistance, an official
of that company said. Japan System expects to post a pretax
loss of 2.95 billion yen in the fiscal year ending March 31,
in comparison to a pretax profit of 1.4 billion yen in the
prior year.
   In return for its investment in the company, EDS will gain
access to the Japanese software market, where independent
computer services of the kind provided by EDS are not widely
employed. EDS currently has only a small presence in Japan.
EDS and Japan System have yet to finalize plans to cooperate
in software development.
