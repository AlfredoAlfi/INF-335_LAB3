Florida Governor Seeks
   $1.35 Billion in New Taxes
Florida has no personal income tax and relies on its 6%
sales tax to fund state programs. But sales tax revenue has
been hard hit by reduced consumer spending due to the
recession, and legislators have cut at least $1.5 billion in
government spending in the past year.
   If the governor's plan is approved, it would raise teacher
salaries, improve children's health care, and enact other
reforms.
   But some doubt the plan will have much success.
Legislators, up for election in reapportioned districts this
fall, may be hesitant to support a tax increase. And they may
not want to boost taxes in a time of high state unemployment
and a soft economy.
   "There's very little chance it will pass in its entirety,"
said Dominic Calabro, president of Florida Taxwatch, a
taxpayers watchdog group. "The timing is very bad because of
the severe recession in our state. It's really taxing life's
necessities."
