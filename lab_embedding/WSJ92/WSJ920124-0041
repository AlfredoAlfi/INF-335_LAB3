Anti-Smoking Campaign
   Faces Threat in California
In a proposal submitted to the Legislature Jan. 9, Mr.
Wilson said he wants to use $122.8 million in tobacco tax
revenue to offset a budget shortfall and pay for health care.
The money is earmarked by the state constitution for
anti-smoking efforts and includes $30 million set aside for
the ad campaign, along with funding for community and school
anti-smoking programs.
   The proposal awaits action by the Legislature but has
already had an impact. A new series of ads scheduled to air
this month was suspended, anti-smoking organizations said.
   Wilson aides said the cuts are necessary to help close a
two-year shortfall expected to approach $7 billion and to pay
for a health-care program for poor pregnant women and
infants. They said the money would be restored when the
economy improves.
