Business Brief -- ITT Corp.:
   Unit to Buy Part of Line
   Of Lincoln National Corp.
In January, Lincoln said it was selling or transferring
most of its managed care operations to Great-West Life 
Annuity Co., Englewood, Colo., and TakeCare Inc., Concord,
Calif. Under the agreement, Great-West initially expected to
buy the portion that is being sold to ITT along with
Lincoln's indemnity business.
   Great-West decided, however, that it only wanted to buy
the indemnity business. TakeCare is still buying Lincoln's
health maintenance organizations.
