Business Brief -- General Dynamics Corp.:
   Plan to Stop Building Sub
   To Cost Up to 4,000 Jobs
Some of the 21,000 employees at the division based in
Groton, Conn., will begin receiving layoff notices Feb. 18,
the Falls Church, Va., company said. General Dynamics, which
has a total work force of 80,000, had been scheduled to build
two more of the submarines after the one now being completed.
   Even if the two additional submarines were included in the
defense budget, the company's work force would still be cut
by more than 2,000, General Dynamics said.
   Separately, Standard  Poor's Corp. said it placed the
ratings of General Dynamic's commercial paper and senior and
subordinated debt on its CreditWatch list with positive
implications, reflecting company plans to reduce debt to more
conservative levels.
