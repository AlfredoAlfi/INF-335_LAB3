Boycott Against PG
   Over Coffee Purchases
   In El Salvador Halted
Directors of the 27-month-old boycott, which primarily
targeted PG's Folger's coffee brand, said large Salvadoran
coffee growers were funding political assassination teams or
"death squads" involved in that country's civil war.
   The boycott also targeted Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft
General Foods, which makes Maxwell House, and Nestle S.A.'s
Nestle Foods Corp., maker of Nescafe. Coffee is El Salvador's
largest source of revenue. The longshoremen's union that had
refused to cross picket lines to unload containers of
Salvadoran beans at West Coast ports also said it would cease
its protest.
   Boycott leaders Neighbor to Neighbor, a 60,000-member
grass-roots group based here, and the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, based in New York, said PG bought
2% to 8% of its beans from El Salvador. PG, based in
Cincinnati, says the amount was less than 2%.
   Neighbor to Neighbor said it now gives credit to PG for
efforts to "aid in the reconstruction" of El Salvador.
