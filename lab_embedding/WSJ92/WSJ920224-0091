SP Lowers Rating
   Of Japan's Sumitomo
   Trust  Banking Corp.
SP downgraded Sumitomo Trust a year ago, but "the decline
in profitability is greater" than the expectation at that
time, the rating concern said in explaining the latest move.
   SP said that interest rates for loans that the bank makes
are declining faster than the costs of the funds that the
bank raises, so pressure on its profitability is growing.
Also, fees and commissions have started to decline due to the
slowdown in transactions in the securities and real-estate
markets. And "asset quality of the bank has started to show
significant deterioration" from the Sept. 30 fiscal half "in
line with the increase of bankruptcies in the domestic
market."
   SP says the downgrade to single-A-plus affected: the
parent's long-term certificates of deposit and senior debt;
the New York branch's long-term CDs; Sumitomo Trust Finance
(Hongkong) Ltd.'s senior long-term debt that the parent bank
guarantees.
   SP likewise downgraded the Cayman Islands branch's
short-term CDs to single-A-1 from A-1-plus.
   The downgrade affected $2.4 billion of debt in all, SP
said.
