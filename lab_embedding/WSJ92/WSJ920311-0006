Former Stockbroker
   At Prudential-Bache
   Pleads Guilty to Fraud
In his pleading, Mr. Donine explained that he either
forged the customers' signatures on false letters of
authorization, or had them sign blank sheets of paper onto
which an authorization letter was placed, said assistant U.S.
attorney Ronni B. Mac-Laren, who is prosecuting the case. The
letters instructed the firm's cashier to issue him checks
from the accounts, she added.
   Mr. Donine, who is scheduled to be sentenced in federal
court April 20, faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison
and $1 million in fines.
   Mr. Donine's attorney, David Katz, said the amount his
client admitted stealing totaled about $25,000 and called him
a "scapegoat." He added: "The U.S. Attorney's office here has
fiddled while all the massive, billion-dollar securities
frauds were going on under their nose and now they want to
make up for it by sending their Securities Fraud Task Force
after minor-dollar offenses, then trumpeting it to the
press."
