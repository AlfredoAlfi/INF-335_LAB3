Marketing  Media:
   Sales for Paramount Film,
   `Wayne's World,' Set a High
Though it remains to be seen whether "Wayne's World" will
have "legs," or staying power at the box office, the huge
weekend opening is sure to quell naysayers who said the TV
skit might not translate into a successful film. The movie
was among the first put into production by new Paramount
Pictures Chairman Brandon Tartikoff, who was wooed last July
from his post as head of NBC Entertainment, a unit of General
Electric Co. Paramount is a unit of Paramount Communications
Inc.
   The previous record for a film opening over the
President's Day holiday weekend was last year's "Silence of
the Lambs," from Orion Pictures Corp., which opened to $13.7
million.
   "Wayne's World" opened Friday on 1,768 screens. Two other
films, "Fried Green Tomatoes," distributed by the Universal
Studios unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., and
Disney's "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle," were closely tied
for third place, each taking in about $6 million.
