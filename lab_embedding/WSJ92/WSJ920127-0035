Business Brief -- REN Corp.:
   Firm Says 4th-Period Profit
   Will Surpass Some Forecasts
In the fourth quarter of 1990, REN, a provider of renal
dialysis services, had a loss of $5.1 million, or 57 cents a
share, on revenue of $10 million. The company had revenue of
$36.9 million in 1990. Through the first three quarters of
1991, REN had net income of $1.6 million, or 16 cents a
share, on revenue of $38.4 million.
   For 1992, Dr. Tannenbaum said analyst expectations of
earnings of 35 cents a share are "a good base," though the
company will do better if it is successful at digesting its
recent $6 million acquisition of the Institute for Laboratory
Medicine's clinical laboratory in Florida.
