International Brief -- Groupe Michelin:
   Firm Reported to Develop
   A New Production System
Michelin officials weren't immediately available for
comment on the report. In 1990, Chairman Francois Michelin
said the company was in the process of developing a new
production system, but he didn't provide details at the time.
   Michelin's new process is unlikely to be an overnight
success. Most tire makers have been rushing to automate
production, but in doing so have found some problems. The
systems often take longer than anticipated to start up, and
require heavy capital investments. Also, highly automated
lines put in place so far have proven inflexible, requiring
lengthy down time to switch models or sizes of tires.
