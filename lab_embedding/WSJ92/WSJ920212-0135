Pepper...and Salt
When my friends say,
   "It's only a game,"
   I respond by nodding sadly,
   For this phrase is most often used
   When they've trounced me rather badly.

   Lengthened Limelight
                                                                                                       

   With gossips and celebrity biographers
   Competing in squalid disclosure,
   Those getting fifteen minutes of fame
   Now suffer from overexposure.
