   Key Semiconductor Index
   Posts a Gain for December
The industry's key indicator of strength, its book-to-bill
ratio, rose to 1.08 in December. That means that for every
$100 of microchip orders that are shipped, or billed,
manufacturers received $108 of new orders, or bookings. A
ratio above 1.00 indicates that the industry is healthy and
expanding.
   In addition, the trade group said that the November 1991
ratio of 1.00 has been revised to 1.01.
   Semiconductor bookings, or new orders based on a
three-month moving average, were $1.4 billion in December, up
4.7% from November and up 16% from $1.2 billion in December
1990.
   Semiconductor billings, or shipments based on a
three-month moving average, were $1.3 billion in December,
down 2% from November, but up 8.4% from $1.2 billion a year
earlier.
   However, actual semiconductor shipments in the U.S. market
in December increased 8.7% to $1.4 billion from the $1.29
billion shipped in November, the trade group said.
