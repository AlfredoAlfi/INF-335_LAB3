   Arco's Production Plan
   On Alaska North Slope
We've spent many millions of dollars searching for a way
to get production under way. Eventually, we'll do it, but
only when we find an economical way to recover the crude oil.
   West Sak overlies Arco's prolific Kuparuk field. In order
to cut costs and accelerate initial production, we plan to
co-mingle production from the two fields through the same
gathering centers and pipelines. As Kuparuk declines, West
Sak will increase.
   As far as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is
concerned, we have long supported opening the area. But I
doubt that Arco's shareholders would favor delaying
production from West Sak to try to force exploration of the
Refuge, which may not occur for many years. Neither do we.
