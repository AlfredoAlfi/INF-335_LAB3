Mesa's Pickens Promotes
   Vehicle Conversion Deal
Under Mr. Pickens's plan, a Mesa unit, Mesa Environmental,
would convert existing gasoline-powered buses, trucks and
cars to use natural gas. Mesa would pay for this conversion
in return for a natural gas supply contract with the operator
at an above-market price for natural gas.
   The attraction, said Mr. Pickens, is cleaner air and
cheaper fuel. Natural gas, whose price doesn't currently
include road taxes, is roughly half the cost of
tax-encumbered gasoline. Thus, even at an above-market rate
for natural gas, fleet operators could save money on fuel, a
spokesman for Mesa said.
   The Mesa spokesman said the company believes there are
about 10,000 fleet vehicles in a five-mile radius of Phoenix
that would qualify for the conversion program and that Mesa
would need a minimum of about 1,000 vehicles to make its
program profitable. "We'll know in a very short period what
the level of interest is," said the spokesman. Mesa is based
in Amarillo, Texas.
