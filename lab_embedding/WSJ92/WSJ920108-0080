   Pre-Empts Rival's Prior Sale
Cray Computer was to deliver its Cray-3 in October 1992.
Cray Research, Eagan, Minn., said it will deliver its Y-MP
C90 in the second half of 1992. Both the Cray-3 and the Y-MP
C90 sell for about $30 million and both are supposed to be
capable of producing 16 million calculations a second over 16
processors. But the Cray-3 was to use gallium arsenide
circuits, instead of the traditional silicon, which was
expected to allow it to operate at faster speeds.
