Money Funds' Assets
   Climb on Turbulence
   In the Bond Markets
The increase came even as the average seven-day compound
taxable yield dropped to 3.85% from 3.86%. The average 30-day
compound yield eased to 3.91% from 3.98%. Compound yields
assume reinvestment of dividends.
   Meanwhile, the average seven-day simple yield of the
taxable money funds remained at 3.78%, and the average 30-day
simple yield eased to 3.84% from 3.90%.
   But change could be in the air. "Rates are bottoming,"
says Martha Wittbrodt, the newsletter's editor. "This could
be a turning point."
   The average maturity of the investments in taxable
money-fund portfolios fell one day to 57 days. The funds
invest in commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
   Assets of 293 tax-free funds also increased, from $98.8
billion to $99.6 billion.
   The average seven-day compound yield of tax-free funds
fell to 2.66% from 2.73%. The latest yield is equivalent to
3.69% on a taxable investment for someone in the 28% tax
bracket and to 3.97% for those paying 31% in taxes.
   The average maturity of the investments in tax-free funds
fell by two days, to 51 days.
