Interprovincial Plans
   New Entity to Hold
   Assets Separately
"IPL is currently considering a number of investment
opportunities which may be unregulated or regulated
separately," said Brian MacNeill, president and chief
executive of the company. These include a new refined
products line from Quebec City to Montreal and the possible
conversion of an oil pipeline to transport natural gas.
   The spokesman said shareholders will receive one share of
the new public corporation in exchange for each
Interprovincial share held. The company doesn't contemplate
any management changes, expects to maintain the same dividend
rate and will continue to be listed on the same stock
exchanges, he said.
   The company said a special resolution proposing the change
in structure will be presented to the company's annual
meeting May 9. It said its majority shareholder, GW Utilities
Ltd., a Toronto holding company controlled by the Reichmann
family, intends to support the resolution. The proposal also
requires court and regulatory approvals.
