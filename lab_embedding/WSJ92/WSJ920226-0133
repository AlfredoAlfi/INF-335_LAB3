   Mapfre's Pretax Profit Rises
Mapfre officials attributed the increase in Spain to a 23%
rise in premium income to 77.3 billion pesetas, as well as to
several non-recurring factors. These included a sharp
increase in earnings on real estate sales, a rise in the
value of its fixed-income portfolio and lower provisions for
its international business.
