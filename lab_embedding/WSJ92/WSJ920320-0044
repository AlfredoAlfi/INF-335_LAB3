   Totaling $27.4 Million
   For the Latest Quarter
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The troubled steelmaker had an extraordinary loss of 113
million guilders, compared with an extraordinary loss of nine
million guilders a year earlier.
   As a result of the weak performance, Hoogovens said it
wouldn't pay a 1991 dividend. In 1990, the company's payout
was 4.40 guilders a share.
   Hoogovens Chairman Oliver van Royen said the company would
"favor any kind of cooperation," for both its steel and
aluminum divisions. He said that talks are in progress with a
number of potential partners, and that Hoogovens is mainly
interested in dealing with other European companies. Mr. van
Royen said cooperation is essential because of the
increasingly competitive environment in which the company
operates.
   Mr. van Royen indicated that a turnaround also depends on
a general economic recovery, and noted that some positive
signs are now emerging from the U.S. He added that higher
prices for the company's steel and aluminum products are
"really necessary at this moment."
