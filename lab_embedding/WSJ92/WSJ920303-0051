Business Brief -- UAL Corp.:
   United Air Plans to Expand
   Service at Its Denver Hub
United may be trying to improve its position against
Denver rival Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., which is
operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy-court
protection and has fewer resources than United.
   Separately, United started service to San Jose, Costa
Rica, and to Guatemala City as part of its expansion to Latin
America. United recently acquired rights to Latin American
routes from Pan American World Airways, which stopped flying
last year.
