Director Kurosawa Sues
   Distributor of His Films
According to court documents, Mr. Kurosawa joined Toho as
an assistant director in 1936. Toho is still distributing his
films.
   The 81-year-old director said in the documents that Toho
breached an agreement in which it promised to pay him 4% of
each of the distribution fees paid by secondary distributors
or television stations seeking permission to air any of his
films.
   In July, Toho initialed a distribution contract with Nihon
Eisei under which Toho authorized Wowow to broadcast 21
Kurosawa films up to 13 times each, the documents say. In
November, the network started broadcasting his films. Shuji
Sato, chief of Toho's investigation division, declined to
comment.
