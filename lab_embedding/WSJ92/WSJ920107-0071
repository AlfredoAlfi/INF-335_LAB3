International:
   `Umbrella Murder' Figure
   Is Found Dead in Bulgaria
Mr. Markov, a writer who worked for the British
Broadcasting Corp., died in 1978 after feeling a sharp jab in
the leg as he waited at a London bus stop. A minute pellet
containing the deadly poison ricin was subsequently found in
his thigh, apparently injected with an umbrella tip.
   Gen. Savov, along with former Bulgarian intelligence chief
Gen. Vladimir Todorov, was charged with removing Markov's
file from state security archives. Their trial had been due
to start Wednesday. Two months ago, Mr. Savov said he
intended to reveal all details of the Markov case during the
trial.
