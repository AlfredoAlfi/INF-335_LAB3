Business Brief -- WSGP Partners:
   Tokio Marine to Withdraw
   Big Part of Its Investment
Mr. Parsky said WSGP will continue to seek industrial
acquisitions without Tokio Marine, which began investing with
WSGP in July 1990. The Japanese insurance company had been
WSGP's major source of outside capital. Mr. Parsky said WSGP
may seek new investors, adding: "We have adequate capital to
continue."
   Negotiations on the exact amount of Tokio Marine's
withdrawal are continuing. Executives familiar with the talks
said Tokio Marine will be able to pull out at least half of
its $100 million investment, but will leave some capital with
WSGP. Tokio Marine said it expects to complete its withdrawal
on March 26.
