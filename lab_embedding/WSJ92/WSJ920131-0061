Business Brief -- Rank Organisation PLC:
   British Firm's Pretax Profit
   Declined 20% in Fiscal Year
The results were at the top of the range estimated by
analysts.
   Operating profit of Rank's main divisions rose 29% to
#186.6 million from #145.1 million. All of Rank's activities
except film and television posted profit gains.
   Rank's net interest bill jumped to #93 million from #16.2
million. Net borrowings rose 35% to #960.8 million from
#710.2 million.
   Rank said its interest bill outpaced its debt load because
of higher real borrowing rates and the large amount of gross
debt inherited from Mecca Leisure Group PLC, which Rank
bought in June 1990.
   To help pay down its debt, Rank said it sold 80 peripheral
business activities and properties.
