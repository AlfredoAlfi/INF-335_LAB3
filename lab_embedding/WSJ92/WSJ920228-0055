Business Brief -- Tandy Corp.:
   Proposal for Repurchasing
   12 Million Shares Is Cleared
Tandy is banking that its strategy of moving into new
technologies and new retail ventures will succeed and its
stock price will rise well above $39.25 over the next three
years.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Tandy closed at $30.25, down 50 cents.
   Under a Dutch auction tender offer, shareholders may
tender their shares at any price within that range. The
company will pay the lowest price it can to buy 12 million
shares. The company had 77.1 million shares outstanding at
Dec. 31, before it offered the new preferred shares.
