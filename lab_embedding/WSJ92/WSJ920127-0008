Sears' Discover Cancels
   50,000 `Unscreened' Cards
"It's virtually unheard of," said Kurt T. Peters,
publisher of Chicago-based Credit Card News. "Issuers go to
great lengths to see that this doesn't happen. The card
market is pretty aggressive, but I don't think they've gotten
that aggressive."
   Mr. Peters said that rescinding the cards could
technically be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
which requires that credit-issuing institutions stand by a
firm offer of credit. The Discover spokeswoman said the
company "has not violated the act as far as I can see."
   Discover is one of the largest credit card issuers in the
U.S., with 41 million accounts.
