Who's News:
   Kidder Names Picchi
   As Petroleum Analyst
At Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., Mr. Picchi will
be a managing director. Known for his knowledge of Russian
oil development, Mr. Picchi said he plans to broaden his
coverage, particularly in Europe.
   Salomon's scandal "really is only a small part of" why he
left, said Mr. Picchi. "That's almost inconsequential."
Instead, Mr. Picchi said Kidder research chief Theodore
Johnson is an old friend, and that he was impressed with GE's
plans to instill its management style at Kidder. "When I got
over here I saw what GE is trying to do with Kidder, it
really became a compelling story," he said.
   Mr. Picchi joined Salomon in 1980 from Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh, where he had spent nine years. He said his
current outlook is that oil prices will stay low, probably
$18 to $19 a barrel for the rest of the year, "and thus there
are challenges for oil companies."
