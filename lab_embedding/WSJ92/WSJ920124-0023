Business Brief -- Raychem Corp.:
   Fiscal Second-Quarter Loss
   Posted, Including Settlement
The quarter also included an $8 million charge to cover
the shutdown of Taliq, a display-device maker, and a $3
million gain from selling a building in Germany.
   Citing the recession and the likelihood of declining
defense spending world-wide, Raychem said it expects a tough
fiscal second half, adding it is "particularly concerned
about the potential for further deterioration in our
electronics business."
