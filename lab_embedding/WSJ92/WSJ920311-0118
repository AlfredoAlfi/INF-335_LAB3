Greenspan Asks That Fed
   Be Allowed To Pay Interest
In a letter to a House Banking subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan
said that if the Fed had been authorized to pay interest on
reserves, it wouldn't have decided last month to reduce the
percentage of checking deposits that banks must hold as
reserves to 10% from 12%.
   Mr. Greenspan wrote that the Fed board of governors
"judged that receiving this authority from the Congress
wasn't likely in the near term, but that some relief from the
reserve-requirement burden for depositories and their
customers in current circumstances was far better than none."
   The Fed chairman also said measures of money supply remain
important in making monetary policy, but can't be the only
measure the central bank watches. "Intermediate-term
movements" in money supply "are not linked closely enough
with those of nominal income to justify a single-minded
focus" on money supply, he said.
