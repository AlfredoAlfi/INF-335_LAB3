Southmark Receives
   Payments by Firms
   In Lawsuit Settlement
Under the settlement, Southmark will receive payments
between now and June 1994, and two companies controlled by
Messrs. Phillips and Friedman will receive 15 properties and
six mortgages now owned by Southmark. Southmark has said the
properties are either in or near foreclosure proceedings and
said the portfolio is of "nominal value." Mr. Friedman,
however, disputes that claim, saying appraisals will show
that the properties do have value.
   Of the initial $4 million payment, Transcontinental Realty
Investors Inc., a real estate investment trust, paid $3.2
million; National Realty L.P., a real estate partnership,
paid $400,000, and a group of real estate investment trusts
also controlled by Messrs. Phillips and Friedman paid
$357,000.
   Transcontinental, which is receiving 10 properties and
four mortgages from Southmark, will pay as much as $4.4
million more to Southmark over the next 26 months. The $1.1
million not paid by the public entities will be paid by
either Messrs. Phillips and Friedman or private companies
they control.
