Marketing  Media:
   Time Warner in Pact to Buy
   Rest of American Television
Under Time Warner's revised offer, the company will swap
new debt securities, known as reset notes, for each of the
19.7 million publicly held shares of ATC. The notes could be
redeemed for $82.50 a share in cash or securities in August
1995. That gives the offer an indicated total value of about
$1.62 billion in that year, up from an estimated $1.47
billion in the original offer.
   Originally, the broadcasting, cable, film and publishing
company had proposed to exchange preferred stock for the ATC
shares. The preferred stock could have been redeemed for Time
Warner stock at any time and for $75 a share three years
after the completion of the deal.
   The ATC deal is part of the company's plans to form Time
Warner Entertainment and sell stakes to foreign partners. The
offer was approved by ATC's board after the unanimous support
of independent directors. It is subject to regulatory
approval and is expected to be completed by July, the company
said.
   American Television, Stamford, Conn., operates cable
systems with approximately 4.8 million subscribers.
