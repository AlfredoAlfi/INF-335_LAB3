Business Brief -- Volkswagen AG:
   Auto Maker Posts Increase
   Of 5% in European Sales
Citing preliminary statistics, Volkswagen, based in
Wolfsburg, said its market share in Western Europe, not
including sales of Czechoslovakian-made Skodas, grew to 16.5%
in 1991 from 15.8% in 1990.
   High demand in Germany was credited for much of the strong
growth last year, the company said.
   Volkswagen's market share in Germany rose to 27.3% from
26.7% because of the introduction of new models and demand
that at times exceeded production capacity.
