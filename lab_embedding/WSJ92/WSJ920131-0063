Business Brief -- Duracell International Inc.:
   Japanese, German Firms Join
   Rechargeable Battery Project
The batteries, made of nickel metal hydride, are used in
such high-power electrical devices as cellular telephones,
camcorders and notebook computers, Duracell said. Most of the
applications currently are powered by nickel cadmium
batteries.
   Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., said the nickel metal
hydride batteries last longer, and could eliminate cadmium,
which is considered an environmentally problematic heavy
metal.
   Each company already has made substantial investments in
basic technology on the nickel metal hydride batteries.
Coordination will speed the process, they said.
