Devon Energy Seeks
   To Buy Hondo Oil's
   Assets for $140 Million
When a definitive agreement is reached, Devon will file a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the offering. Devon's total common shares
outstanding would increase to between 15 million and 17
million from 8.7 million.
   When the acquisition closes, the company anticipates its
bank debt increasing to between $90 million and $100 million
from $32 million. Devon said its banks are apparently willing
to expand existing credit facilities up to $115 million.
   The properties Devon is negotiating to purchase will more
than quadruple the company's oil reserves to 17 million
barrels of oil from 3.8 million barrels of oil. Gas reserves
would increase some 40% to between 270 billion cubic feet and
275 billion cubic feet of gas, from 191.6 billion cubic feet.
   The assets to be acquired include interests in 2,700
properties, which have 5,300 producing oil and gas wells.
Most of the wells are located in the states of Texas,
Oklahoma, New Mexico and Wyoming. The purchase also includes
drilling rights on undeveloped acreage, seismic information,
interests in seven natural gas processing plants and other
assets valued at $14 million to $16 million.
