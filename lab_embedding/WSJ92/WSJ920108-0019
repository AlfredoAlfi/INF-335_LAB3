Bush Demands More Access
   For U.S. Goods in Japan
Mr. Bush attended the opening, led by Toys "R" Us Chairman
Charles Lazarus, because it represented the successful
conclusion of a three-year-battle to relax Japanese laws that
inhibited the establishment of large retail outlets. As he
has throughout his 12-day trip, Mr. Bush used personal charm
to soften the impact of his tough message, telling his
audience he wanted to buy some toys but his wife Barbara "has
cut my kozukai -- my allowance, that is."
   Mr. Bush's comments came as Japanese officials were about
to announce plans for Japanese companies to boost imports of
manufactured goods substantially in the wake of Mr. Bush's
visit.
   Mr. Bush lauded the U.S.'s close ties with Japan but said
"we still face many challenges. And each partner must realize
that it benefits from free trade and open markets. Our
economic relationship is not a zero-sum game for either
side."
