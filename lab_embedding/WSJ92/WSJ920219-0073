Samuel M. Miller, senior vice president of finance, said
the company is "extremely gratified" to have reached record
sales and earnings despite a slowdown in consumer spending.
   Separately, Liz Claiborne said that under its stock
repurchase plan it has bought about 4.5 million shares of its
common stock for $124 million through Feb. 14.
   VF posted fourth-quarter earnings of $48.4 million, or 83
cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.9 million, or 19
cents a share, a year earlier. The previous year's
fourth-quarter results included a restructuring charge of
$33.2 million, or 34 cents a share. The company's sales
jumped to $850.3 million from $687.6 million a year earlier.
   The company said it posted increased sales in all four
product categories -- jeans, casual wear and sportswear,
intimate apparel and other apparel-and was helped by
turnarounds in the Lee and Jantzen lines.
