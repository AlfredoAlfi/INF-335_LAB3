Saab Auto's Production Cutback
According to Saab's revised estimates, output will be
decreased by just under 3,500 vehicles in the period,
compared with an earlier estimate of 2,000 to 2,500, said a
spokesman.
   Moreover, the six-hour-a-week reduction in production at
the plant originally scheduled to end March 4 will be
extended through the last week of April, he said.
