International:
   Weeklong Occupation Ends
   At South Korean Auto Plant
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Union officials said the last of their workers had left
the plant, but made no other statement. Korean television
said the plant's union office was vacant.
   There were no immediate arrests, police said.
   The workers took over the plant Jan. 15 after it was
closed by the company following a union strike vote. The
dispute began Dec. 17 when the union demanded a one-time
bonus equal to 150% of monthly salaries.
   Helicopters had flown over the plant, dropping leaflets
warning workers about the dawn evacuation deadline and
threatening an assault after riot police deployed throughout
this port city some 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
