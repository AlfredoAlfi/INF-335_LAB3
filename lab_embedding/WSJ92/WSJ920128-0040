Business Brief -- Schering-Plough Corp.:
   Concern Posts 14% Increase
   In Fourth-Quarter Earnings
For 1991, net income rose to $645.6 million, or $3.01 a
share, compared with 1990's $565.1 million, or $2.50 a share.
Sales rose 9% to $3.62 billion from the prior year's $3.32
billion. Foreign currency exchange had minimal effect on
full-year sales, and excluding 1990 sales from the Maybelline
cosmetics unit, which the company divested itself of in July
1990, sales for 1991 would have been 13% higher than the
previous year's.
   The pharmaceutical company attributed the year's results
to strong international sales, which grew 12% in 1991. U.S.
pharmaceutical sales rose 10%.
