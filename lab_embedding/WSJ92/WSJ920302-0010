Merger of Mitsubishi
   And Bank of Tokyo
   Still Seen as Possible
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
A merger of Mitsubishi Bank and Bank of Tokyo would create
the world's largest commercial bank with assets of around 88
trillion yen ($681.8 billion). In September, Bank of Tokyo
had assets of 29.78 trillion yen, while Mitsubishi had assets
of 58.45 trillion yen. The current top bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, has assets of around 62 trillion yen.
   Bank of Tokyo, in a statement, said "in the long run, as a
strategic option, we may study the possibility of a merger
but for the foreseeable future, we have no such plans." With
the bank expecting a healthy rise in profit for the year
ending March 31, one official said Bank of Tokyo is under no
financial pressure to seek a merger.
   But the Bank of Tokyo's "niche (as a foreign-exchange
bank) doesn't exist any more," said one analyst. With
Japanese banks scaling back their overseas operations
recently, "other banks can go back home. Bank of Tokyo has no
`home' to go to," the analyst said.
   While some of the major Japanese commercial banks have
more than 300 to 400 local branches, Bank of Tokyo has
roughly 35. But the bank boasts the biggest overseas network
of any Japanese commercial bank.
