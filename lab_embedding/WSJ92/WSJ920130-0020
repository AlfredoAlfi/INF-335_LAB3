Placer Dome Increases
   Interest in Corona's
   Eskay Creek Deposit
Eskay Creek is expected to begin production in early 1994.
Exploration so far has outlined an estimated three million
ounces of gold, valued at about US$1.07 billion at current
market prices. Production costs are projected to be less than
US$150 an ounce, one of the lowest cost structures in the
industry.
   Corona, which has high debt, said it expects it will be
able to finance its share of the project, but only with more
outside help. "We're still going to need to look into
additional options to get money," a spokeswoman said. She
didn't elaborate. However, Corona canceled an option to issue
C$100 million in preferred shares to Placer, mainly because
the proposed yield was too high, she said.
   The agreement, which is subject to regulatory and other
approvals, comes a month after Placer backed out of another
pact with Corona to develop Eskay Creek.
