Perpetual Savings,
   An SL, Is Acquired
   By Crestar Financial
The sale was the biggest "accelerated resolution" of an
SL by the government. In those sales, the government seeks a
buyer for an ailing institution before it must be seized
rather than allowing a strong franchise to languish in
government hands. Perpetual was a candidate for the program,
the Office of Thrift Supervision said, because of its strong
presence in the local market.
   Crestar will close 39 of Perpetual's 61 branches but will
reopen 22 others today as Crestar branches.
   The transaction calls for Crestar to assume $2.8 billion
in Perpetual deposits, and acquire about $1.09 billion in
assets, including about $350 million in mortgages and other
loans. Crestar will receive a $1.78 billion advance to
facilitate the transaction. It will pay a premium of $7.8
million for the purchase. The Resolution Trust Corp., the SL
bailout agency, will retain $2.3 billion in assets, much of
it commercial real estate, for later sale.
   Government sales and liquidations of failed SLs total
584, as part of the industry cleanup begun more than two
years ago. Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, was in the running
to buy Perpetual last summer, regulators said, but the deal
fell through.
