U.S. Army to Sell Materiel
   As Threat of Conflict Fades
The immediate purpose is to raise money to help buy new
equipment, but the long-term goal appears to be to try to
stave off even deeper personnel reductions by convincing
Congress that the Army is exploring every potential path to
save money. Lawmakers have talked about saving billions of
dollars annually by reducing inventories of spare parts and
everyday items consumed by the military. Many Pentagon
critics contend, however, that such steps merely delay
necessary, but painful, decision-making to force additional
uniformed personnel off the payroll.
