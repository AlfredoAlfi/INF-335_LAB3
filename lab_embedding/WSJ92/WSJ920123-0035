International:
   Germany Limits Export
   Guarantees to C.I.S. for '92
The available credits will also be under a tighter rein.
For instance, the new credits won't be available for business
with Soviet states that didn't sign a debt agreement with
Western government creditors earlier this year.
   Mr. Moellemann added, however, that the cabinet will
review in late March whether the cap should be increased,
especially where eastern German exporters might benefit. The
export-credit program is Bonn's favored means of aid because
it secures 300,000 jobs at former Soviet suppliers in eastern
Germany.
   The German government said it doesn't have figures yet on
the amount of guarantees provided last year. However, an
Economics Ministry spokeswoman said the total in 1991 was
more than 5 billion marks. As of the end of last year,
Germany had extended a cumulative total of 29.5 billion marks
in the guarantee program.
