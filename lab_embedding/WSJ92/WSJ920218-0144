   Music to Soothe
   The Savage Loins
The Pittsburgh orchestra doesn't need saving. The
orchestra, which was founded by Andrew Carnegie nearly 100
years ago and whose current music director and conductor is
the world-famous Lorin Maazel, is embarking on yet another
extensive European concert tour in May.
