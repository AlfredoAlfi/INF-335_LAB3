Business Brief -- Dominion Resources Inc.:
   Virginia Court, in Reversal,
   Overturns Expedited Ruling
Dominion Resources, in a telephone conference, said the
expedited rate decision was about four months faster than a
general rate change request. The Richmond, Va., company filed
a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last
Friday about the court's reversal, and said it was
"evaluating its options. The ultimate outcome cannot be
determined at the present time but the effects may be greater
than previously anticipated and could prove to be
significant."
   Dominion officials said yesterday that the court ruling
was ambiguous, and it might seek a re-hearing before the
court.
