Business Brief -- Gehl Co.:
   Equipment Manufacturer
   Posts Loss of $10 Million
Gehl said sales of agricultural and construction equipment
were hurt by low consumer confidence, reflecting the weak
economy and drought, among other things. Gehl said it
significantly lowered its production rate in 1991 because of
weak demand, and to allow dealers to reduce inventories.
   To help it break even in 1992, Gehl said it launched a new
lending agreement with ITT Commerical Finance for up to $75
million over three years. The company said it will use
initial proceeds in part to pay down $50 million of debt.
