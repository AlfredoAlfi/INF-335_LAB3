Systems Industries to Post Loss
Systems Industries expects to post onetime charges of
about $1.5 million for the quarter, for the settlement of
legal matters and costs associated with a recent registration
statement, among other expenses. The company said results
also were hurt by sluggish markets for its products, and the
weak dollar in Europe.
