Magazine Survey Lists
   Firms Offering Best
   Workplace for Blacks
The list was developed through a survey of Fortune 1000
companies that have demonstrated "a sustained interest" in
recruiting, hiring, retaining and promoting black Americans.
It also is based on interviews with black executives at the
companies, recommendations by black management experts and
reviews of each company's affirmative action/equal employment
opportunity and cultural diversity policies.
   The companies "have substantively recognized the
bottom-line benefit of workforce diversity," Earl G. Graves,
publisher, said. He applauded the companies for adhering to
strong affirmative action policies, and for developing
initiatives to support blacks.
