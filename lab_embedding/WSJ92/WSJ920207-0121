Business Brief:
   Texaco to Resume
   Oil Production Soon
   From Kuwait Field
Production in Kuwait has been rising steadily. And Japan's
Arabian Oil Co. has been producing oil from the offshore
portion of the neutral zone for weeks. Wells in the al-Wafra
field had been damaged by fire during the invasion, but the
field didn't sustain anywhere the amount of damage as
Kuwait's oil fields further north.
   Texaco is expected to export the heavy crude produced from
the al-Wafra field. Before the invasion, it was refining its
crude in a refinery near al-Wafra. But that refinery was
destroyed during the invasion and hasn't been rebuilt.
