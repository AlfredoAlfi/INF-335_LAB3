Business Brief -- Fairfield Communities Inc.:
   Bankruptcy Judge Approves
   Altered Reorganization Plan
Fairfield said that it believes it has addressed the
bank's concerns with the amendment but that the bank still
may oppose the plan.
   Ballots will be mailed Jan. 21 and the deadline for voting
and filing objections was set for Feb. 21. Fairfield said it
has cash available to meet its needs if the plan is confirmed
during March, but said that further delays could make it
unable to complete the reorganization.
