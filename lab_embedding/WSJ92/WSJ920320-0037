Newmont Mining Set
   To Buy Nevada Stake
The claims lie west and north of Newmont Gold Co.'s
Genesis mine on the Carlin Trend in Nevada. Newmont Gold is
90.1%-owned by Newmont. It also is adjacent to other land on
which Newmont and Newmont Gold own or control mineral rights.
   The transactions are expected to be completed by June 23
and are subject to shareholder approvals at the selling
companies and to Newmont buying the entire 75% interest.
   After the purchase, Newmont said it plans to form a new
joint venture with the Cornucopia unit, which will hold the
remaining 25% interest, to explore the property's potential.
