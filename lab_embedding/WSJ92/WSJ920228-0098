Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 28.2% involved
stock-index arbitrage, down from 41.9% the prior week. In
this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index
options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 30.3% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 42.1%
involved trading for customers. An additional 27.6% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, only Nomura Securities did
most or all of its program trading for its own accounts,
rather than for customers.
