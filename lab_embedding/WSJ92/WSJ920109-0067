Business Brief -- Wisconsin Central Transportation:
   Railroad Company to Pay
   Itel $61.2 Million for Assets
In addition, Wisconsin Central said it agreed to buy the
operating assets of Itel's Fox River Valley Railroad Corp.
for about $52.8 million, of which as much as $30 million may
be in the form of Wisconsin Central shares. Fox River
operates 208 miles of track, also in Wisconsin.
   The pact requires clearance by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, Wisconsin Central said. The company doesn't
expect the transaction to close until late 1992.
   A spokeswoman for Itel, a diversified holding company
26%-controlled by investor Sam Zell, said Itel doesn't expect
the transaction to have any material effect on earnings.
