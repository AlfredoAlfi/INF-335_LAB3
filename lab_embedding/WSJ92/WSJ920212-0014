Degree of Monetary Ease
   Is Adequate, Fed Chief Says
The chairman's statements basically echoed his testimony
last week before the House Budget Committee. A few hours
after that hearing, Fed policy makers met to set monetary
policy for the next few weeks. Their decision hasn't been
disclosed, but it appears the Fed decided not to cut interest
rates immediately.
   In his speech to the bankers, Mr. Greenspan pointed to
several encouraging signs for the economy, including
corporations and households shrinking their debt. But he said
that "despite these positive signs, assessing the economic
outlook at the present time is extraordinarily difficult"
because of, among other factors, poor business and consumer
confidence.
