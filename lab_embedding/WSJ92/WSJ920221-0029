South Korea Launches
   Probe of Hyundai Group
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The national Yonhap news agency and most Seoul newspapers
said the tax investigation was launched on Hyundai's 42
subsidiaries after one of them was found to have kept shares
under disguised names.
   A routine tax investigation into Hyundai Merchant Marine
Co. raised the suspicion that some stocks owned by Mr.
Chung's family were being kept under disguised names to avoid
taxes, Yonhap quoted an official as saying.
   Yonhap added that tax investigators were sent to Hyundai
Securities Co., a suspected conduit for the illegal
concealment of shares, to look for disguised stock ownership
in other subsidiaries.
   Tax officials declined to confirm the reports. Tax probes
in South Korea are generally carried out in a covert manner.
   The high-profile Mr. Chung, who often criticized
government economic policies, has recently left Hyundai's
management and entered politics, forming a political party.
Mr. Chung's Unification National Party is expected to hurt
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, whose popularity has
recently declined due mainly to growing economic woes.
