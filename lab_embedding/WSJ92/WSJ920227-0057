Business Brief -- Oshkosh B'Gosh Inc.:
   Maker of Children's Clothes
   Posts Loss for 4th Quarter
The company called the results, which appear to be
substantially below analysts' estimates, "very
disappointing." Oshkosh released the figures after the
markets closed. In national over-the-counter trading, Oshkosh
was unchanged at $29.25.
   Oshkosh blamed "substantially lower gross margins"
resulting from "increased sales of close-out merchandise,
less efficient manufacturing operations and a higher than
anticipated write-off of obsolete materials."
   The charge for costs associated with discontinuing the
U.S. Absorba line, which was previously announced, amounted
to 25 cents a share.
