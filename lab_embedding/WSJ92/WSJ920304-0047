Those transactions, plus tax credits and extraordinary
items, allowed the ailing carrier to report net income of
$48.2 million, the preliminary filing with the bankruptcy

   In 1990, TWA reported a loss of $237.5 million. Revenue in
1991 totaled $3.6 billion, down 21% from the previous year's
$4.6 billion. The financial report shows that TWA's operating
losses more than doubled last year, leading to its filing for
Chapter 11 protection from creditors. In 1990, operating
losses totaled $162.3 million.
