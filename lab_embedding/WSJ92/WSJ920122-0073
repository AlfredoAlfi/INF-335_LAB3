Business Brief -- Tandy Corp.:
   Company Files With SEC
   Covering Depositary Shares
Tandy said it would use the proceeds to repurchase shares
of common, to reduce short-term debt or for other corporate
purposes. The offering will be made through an underwriting
syndicate managed by Morgan Stanley  Co.; Goldman, Sachs 
Co., and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.
   Separately, the manufacturer and retailer of personal
computers and electronic products said its fourth-quarter net
income tumbled 20% to $78.8 million, or $1 a share, from $99
million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Tandy had earlier
predicted the decline, which it attributed to costs
associated with new stores and to lower-than-expected profit
margins in personal computers.
   Revenue fell 1% to $1.47 billion from $1.48 billion a year
earlier.
