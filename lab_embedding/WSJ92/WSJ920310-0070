Business Brief -- Dayton Hudson Corp.:
   Department Store Unit
   To Eliminate 630 Jobs
The Minneapolis company said less than 2% of the unit's
34,000 employees will lose their jobs. Since only a
"minuscule percentage" are salespeople, service won't suffer,
a spokeswoman said. The job cuts, nevertheless, affect
managers as well as support staff such as clerical and stock
workers, primarily at the company's 19 Dayton's and 23
Field's stores.
   The 200 employees of the Minneapolis warehouse that is
scheduled to close will be offered jobs at a nearby facility,
the spokeswoman said. The other warehouse that may close is
in Detroit.
