Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 50% involved
stock-index arbitrage, up from 48.2% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 48.8% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 38.5%
involved trading for customers. An additional 12.7% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities and First Boston.
