   Nutritional Data for Kids
   Is Supported by FDA Head
Although still in the talking stage, Dr. Kessler's
suggestion of a kids' nutrition label already has drawn fire
from some food manufacturers. They argue it is premature,
since it might precede the development of an omnibus
nutrition label mandated by Congress and being pushed by the
FDA. That new label is to begin appearing on packages in
midMay of next year.
   In his remarks yesterday, the FDA commissioner cited the
spotty nutritional knowledge of his own children, ages 5 and
9. "They both knew that what you eat can affect your health,"
Dr. Kessler said, but while they were aware of nutrient
information on food packages, neither knew what a gram was.
But, he said, "neither did I before I took this job."
   Asked about what they think about food in commercials on
TV, his children "looked at me incredulously," Dr. Kessler
said. "`Dad,' they said, `they just lie in commercials.' I
told them that commercials were the responsibility of the
FTC.'"
