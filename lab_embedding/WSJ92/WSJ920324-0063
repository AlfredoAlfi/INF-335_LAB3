Business Brief:
   Manville Unit to Buy
   Unit of Pratt Group
In a meeting with analysts in New York this year,
Manville, a building, construction and paper products maker,
said it anticipated spending between $300 million and $400
million to expand its capacity to make paperboard for
beverage containers.
   According to a spokesman, the Macon acquisition from the
Atlanta-based unit of Australia's Pratt Group Holdings would
fulfill those plans. Riverwood International "intends to make
substantial improvements at Macon to equip the mill to
produce Riverwood International's proprietary coated boxboard
grades of paperboard," the company said.
   The acquisition is subject to financing, approval by
Manville and Riverwood International boards, union approvals
and regulatory and environmental consents.
