   Citibank Hires Bowen
   To Reorganize Unit
   In Money Management
Citibank, the flagship bank of the nation's largest
banking company, is in the midst of a companywide
restructuring of management responsibilities. The bank had
traditionally separated the individual and institutional
money management businesses but will now have all its
investment management activities under one executive for the
first time, a spokeswoman said.
   Mr. Bowen, 56, is a 23-year veteran of Hill Samuel, the
last six as chief executive. Hill Samuel manages
approximately $40 billion in international assets.
