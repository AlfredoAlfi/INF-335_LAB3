Business Brief -- Georgia-Pacific Corp.:
   Dioxin Suit Won't Affect
   Finances, Company Reports
The suit, according to the Atlanta forest-products
company, alleges that the American Paper Institute and 33
paper manufacturers, including a subsidiary of
Georgia-Pacific, conspired to suppress information about the
alleged harmful effects of dioxin. The action was filed on
behalf of all individuals who live downstream from pulp mills
that use chlorine in their bleaching process.
   In the SEC filing, Georgia-Pacific said the allegations
are "without merit" and it intends to defend itself
vigorously.
