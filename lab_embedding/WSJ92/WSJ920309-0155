Western Germany's
   Inflation Rate Rises,
   3 States' Data Show
The states of Hesse and Bavaria said February prices were
higher by 4.6% and 4.7%, respectively, from a year ago. The
heavily industrialized state of North-Rhine Westphalia said
earlier that its prices were up 4.3% in a year. The states
account for three of the four western German states whose
prices are used to calculate preliminary cost-of-living data.
   The sudden acceleration in western Germany has pushed the
inflation rate to a level that many economists weren't
expecting until this month or April, when projected inflation
of 4.5% was thought to represent the peak. By already
reaching such levels in February, analysts said western
German inflation could now run up to 4.8% or 5% before
leveling off in the summer.
   The Bundesbank has set the goal of cutting western German
inflation to below 4% by the end of this year. Continuing
price rises, aggressive wage demands from leading trade
unions and rapid growth in the central bank's broadly defined
money supply have been major factors behind the Bundesbank's
policy of high interest rates.
