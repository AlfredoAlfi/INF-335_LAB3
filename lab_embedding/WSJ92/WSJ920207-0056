Business Brief -- W.R. Grace  Co.:
   Profit for Fourth Quarter
   Rose 9.4%, Firm Reports
A hefty increase in health-care earnings and a sharp
decline in interest expense boosted fourth-quarter earnings,
the company said. Specialty chemicals, the company's other
core business, faced an "economic downturn" in such
industries as construction and graphic arts and posted flat
operating profit, Grace said.
   For the year, Grace's earnings rose 7.8% to $218.6
million, or $2.50 a share, from $202.8 million, or $2.36 a
share, in the year-ago period. Sales inched up to $6.05
billion from $5.98 billion.
