   Lowe's Cos. to Take
   $71.3 Million Charge
   In Fiscal 4th Period
Lowe's, which will post fourth-quarter results during the
week of Feb. 24, declined to elaborate on the impact on
earnings for the quarter. But a spokeswoman conceded that
"anyone can conclude" the pretax charge will result in a
quarterly loss.
   For the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company reported
net income of $5.1 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue
of $586 million. For all of 1990, it reported net of $71.1
million, or $1.91 a share, on $2.83 billion in revenue.
   Lowe's said the charge reflects expected costs and
expenses required to speed up its conversion over the next
four years to a chain of large stores, which have greater
consumer appeal.
   Moody's said that a Lowe's competitor, Atlanta-based Home
Depot Inc., "has redefined the home-center industry" with its
huge warehouse operation that combines low prices and high
service. Lowe's senior debt currently is rated single-A-2.
