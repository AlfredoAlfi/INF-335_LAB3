California Tries to Repair
   Waste Spill Off Point Loma
The spill is large; but because the sewage has been
treated and is primarily organic, "I don't think it will be
very big in environmental impact," says Mia Tegner, a marine
biologist with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La
Jolla, Calif. However, the sewage could pose a health hazard
if humans swim or dive in the polluted area, she says.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor is asking city residents
to cut water usage to reduce the flow of sewage. The city
also plans to ask for federal disaster relief. Total repair
costs have been estimated at $10 million, a spokesman for the
mayor says.
   Organizers of the America's Cup yacht races -- currently
taking place off San Diego -- say the spill should not hinder
the competition, although boats will sail past the affected
area on their way to the race course.
