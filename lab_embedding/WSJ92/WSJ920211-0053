Letters to the Editor:
   The True Author
   Of the Bill of Rights
George Mason's influence on the Bill of Rights, however,
cannot be denied. Mason was the author of Virginia's
Declaration of Rights (1776), upon which much of the Bill of
Rights is based. But if one were attempting to attribute
authorship to one person, one would still have to settle on
Madison.
   George Mason's understandable prominence in any discussion
of the Bill of Rights stems from his motion during the
Constitutional Convention (Wednesday, Sept. 12, 1787) that a
Bill of Rights be added to the proposed Constitution. All of
the states represented voted down the motion because it was
generally believed unnecessary.
