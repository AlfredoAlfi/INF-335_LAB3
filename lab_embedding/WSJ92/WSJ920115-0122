Pepper...and Salt
About the same time each January
   It starts to become very clear
   That, if I keep all my resolutions,
   It will definitely be a dull year.

   Rags to Rags?
                                                                                                       

   Some suits I haven't
   Worn for ages,
   And sports gear from past
   Athletic stages
   I'll fondly yearn for
   Without fail,
   The second they show up
   At our garage sale.
