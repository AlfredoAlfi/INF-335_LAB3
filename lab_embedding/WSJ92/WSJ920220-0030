Business Brief -- Vintage Petroleum Inc.:
   Firm Estimates Profit Fell
   About 50% in 4th Quarter
For the year, net is estimated to have been about flat
with the previous year's $6.8 million, or 45 cents a share.
Revenue rose 44% to about $74 million from $51.2 million in
1990, he said in an interview.
   As of Dec. 31, the company had 16.7 million shares
outstanding, compared with 15 million the previous year.
   Most of the revenue increase, about $17 million, relates
to Vintage's new marketing unit, which purchases natural gas
on the spot market for resale, the company said.
   Mr. Stephenson said Vintage is in an acquisition mode
despite depressed prices in the oil and natural gas industry.
In fact, the lower prices are creating acquisition values, he
said. "The major oil companies and others are selling
domestic properties, and we intend to buy," he said.
