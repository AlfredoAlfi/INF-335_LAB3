Business Brief -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.:
   Company Uses Bank Loans
   To Repurchase Junk Bonds
RJR said, however, that the repurchase would be
"advantageous for shareholders in terms of both future cash
flow and earnings." The New York-based tobacco and food
company currently is able to borrow from banks under a
five-year loan facility at about a 5% interest rate. RJR's
overall average borrowing cost is about 10.5%.
   The bonds repurchased are $750 million principal amount of
zero coupon bonds due 2001, $165 million of 15% bonds due
2001, and $85 million of 13.5% bonds due 2001. All three
classes of bonds were created when RJR Nabisco underwent a
leveraged buyout in 1989. The zero coupon bonds, which don't
pay cash interest for several years, have an accreted value,
or current book value, of $550 million.
   RJR declined to say whether the bonds were sold by a major
institution or by a Wall Street firm that had rounded them up
from its customers. RJR did say that the transaction was
initiated by the seller.
