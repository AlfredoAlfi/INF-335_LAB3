International Brief -- Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd.:
   Firm's Lawyers Say Lawsuit
   Against It Is `Misconceived'
On Friday, Bank Bumiputra urged a federal district court
in San Francisco to dismiss the suit by Sinclair (Nominees)
Ltd., based in Hong Kong, identified as a minority
shareholder of the defunct Carrian Group, also based in Hong
Kong. Sinclair alleges that Bank Bumiputra, its former
chairman and two former bank officers acted "in concert and
conspiracy. . . to fraudulently conceal the looting" of
Carrian's property in the U.S., from Carrian's minority
shareholders and creditors.
   Bank Bumiputra said it "is confident that the action will
have no material impact on its financial position."
