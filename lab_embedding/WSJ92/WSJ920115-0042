International Brief -- Security Pacific Corp.:
   Hoare Govett Unit to Cut
   Jobs, Curb Market-Making
The job cuts had been widely anticipated after efforts by
the firm to seek new backers, especially after Security
Pacificc Corp.'s agreement last year to merge with
BankAmerica Corp. raised the prospect of asset dispositions.
   Hoare Govett said the cuts will focus its research on
about 325 stocks, representing 80% of U.K. market
capitalization. Its market-making will still cover 400
stocks, convertible bonds and American depositary receipts.
   Before the latest cuts, Hoare Govett employed about 440
people.
