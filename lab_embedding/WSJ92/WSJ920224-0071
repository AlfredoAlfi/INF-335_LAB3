Who's News:
   International Paper
   Names New Member
   Of Executive Suite
As one of four executive vice presidents, Mr. Suwyn will
report directly to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John
A. Georges. International Paper has no president or chief
operating officer. There are three other executive vice
presidents: Dana G. Mead, who directs the pulp and paper
operations, John T. Dillon, who directs the
packaging-products operations, and James P. Melican, who
supervises legal and external affairs.
   Mr. Suwyn fills a position left vacant after David I.J.
Wang decided to retire last year. Much of Mr. Wang's
responsibilities, particularly in paper distribution, had
been assumed by David W. Oskin, senior vice president. But
Mr. Oskin was recently named chief executive officer of
International Paper's New Zealand affiliate, Carter Holt
Harvey Ltd.
   A spokesman said Mr. Suwyn's international experience and
his experience with imaging products fit with International
Paper's growth in films and photographic papers. Also, he has
a chemical background, which is important in the paper
industry, the spokesman said.
