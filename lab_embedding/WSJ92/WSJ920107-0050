Business Brief -- Spiegel Inc.:
   Honeybee Retail Division
   To Close; Recession Cited
Spiegel said about 150 employees will lose their jobs as a
result of the closures.
   Honeybee, which sells upscale women's apparel, will
continue to operate through specialty catalogs and Spiegel's
major catalogs. Spiegel, 87%-owned by Germany's Otto family,
is best known for its catalog operation.
   "The Honeybee stores have been hard hit by the recession,
especially in the Northeast where they are concentrated,"
said a company official.
   John J. Shea, Spiegel's vice chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said the company made the "difficult
decision" to close the Honeybee outlets -- which had 1991
sales of about $12 million -- because "in the current and
anticipated economic and retail environment, our emphasis
must be on those businesses that show significant growth
potential."
