Fabri-Centers' Sales
   Continue to Increase
   Despite Retail Climate
Mr. Rosskamm credited a rapid conversion to "super stores"
about three times the size of the traditional Fabri-Centers
outlets for most of the sales and earnings growth. However,
he added that the company is recession-resistant, because
women have a greater incentive to sew their own clothes, as
well as curtains and drapes, when personal income decreases.
   "We still prefer a stronger economy, but we aren't hurt"
as much by the slowdown as other retailers, he said.
   The estimated increase in per-share profit understates the
expected rise in net income because Fabri-Centers sold 1.4
million shares in a public offering last May. Average shares
and equivalents rose to 9.6 million for the quarter ended
Nov. 2, the latest figures available, from 7.9 million a year
earlier. The 1990 figure is adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock
split last January.
