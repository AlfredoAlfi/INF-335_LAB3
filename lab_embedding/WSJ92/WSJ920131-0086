   International Specialty
   Chief Financial Officer
   To Join MacAndrews
Mr. Engelman will be executive vice president and chief
financial officer at MacAndrews, according to International
Specialty. Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief executive
officer of GAF and International Specialty, noted Mr.
Engelman's "significant contribution" to the company's
transition in the past two years from a highly leveraged
private concern to one with substantial equity. GAF, which
owns about 80% of International Specialty, sold 19.4 million
shares in the offering. The stock was quoted late yesterday
at $14.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mr. Engelman said, "the opportunities offered by the
MacAndrews  Forbes position were just too attractive for me
to pass up."
