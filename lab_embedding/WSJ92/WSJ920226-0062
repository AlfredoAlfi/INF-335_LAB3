Business Brief -- Margaretten Financial Corp.:
   January Refinancings Help
   To Raise Mortgage Loans
Loan applications, meanwhile, totaled 11,167 compared with
4,152 the year before. Felix M. Beck, chairman and chief
executive, attributed the jump in loan applications to low
interest rates and "our efforts during the past year to
increase the production capacity of Margaretten's retail and
wholesale division."
   Margaretten went public earlier this month in an unusual
initial offering in which Primerica sold its entire stake.
The offering comprised 15 million common shares at $20 a
share, including 12.1 million sold by a Primerica unit.
