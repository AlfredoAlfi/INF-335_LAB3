Big Board to Suspend
   Trading of 3 Firms
   Over Listing Criteria
The exchange said the companies don't meet the Big Board's
continued-listing criteria related to total market value of
publicly held shares (minumum $5 million) and market value of
all shares outstanding (minimum $8 million), plus three-year
average net income (minimum $600,000).
   After the suspensions, the exchange will apply to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to delist American Savings
and to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist
Homestead Financial and Canal Capital.
