International Brief -- Vickers PLC:
   Firm Posts '91 Pretax Loss
   And Cuts Dividend by 39%
The U.K. defense contractor and engineering group blamed
general operating losses, plus a #34.4 million exceptional
restructuring charge at its Rolls-Royce cars division.
   Sales dropped 16%, to #652.2 million.
   Chairman David Plastow said he had warned investors that
the company would have had to have seen a big improvement in
sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury cars to maintain its
dividend.
   "Sadly, there are not yet any signs of a significant
increase in car sales in any market," Mr. Plastow said.
   Vickers said it "will continue to review the options for
the future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in the best interests of
shareholders." Last December, the company said the
high-profile division "has attracted considerable interest
from a number of international companies."
