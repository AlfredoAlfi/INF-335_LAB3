Business Brief -- Tandy Corp.:
   Another 11 Discount Stores
   Slated to Open This Year
The expansion is one of several retail concepts that Tandy
is exploring to revive its growth. The big electronics
manufacturer and retailer is best known for its Radio Shack
outlets, but in recent years it has been experimenting with
other concepts.
   Earlier this week, it said it opened the first of three
Radio Shack "super stores," which are twice the size of the
usual Radio Shack store and will be used to test
merchandising techniques and product displays.
   The Computer City stores feature brand-name software and
computers from Apple Computer Inc., International Business
Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp., as well as Tandy,
at competitive prices.
