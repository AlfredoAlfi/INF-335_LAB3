Ex-Hughes Official Enters
   Guilty Plea in Intelsat Case
Mr. Visher was a senior official in the Hughes group that
sold satellites to Intelsat, an international satellite
consortium. Mr. Alegrett, who rose to become the No. 2
official at Intelsat, was named as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the case. He was convicted of fraud in 1988
in connection with a separate scam involving the construction
of Intelsat's headquarters. He served 16 months in prison.
   Mr. Visher, who will be sentenced in March, couldn't be
reached for comment. He left Hughes, a unit of General Motors
Corp., in 1987.
