Technology Brief -- Merck  Co.:
   Certain U.S. Health Centers
   To Receive Low-Cost Drugs
Earlier this month, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. announced a
similar program.
   Drug companies have been under pressure to rein in the
sharp rise in pharmaceutical prices. If other companies
follow the lead of Merck and Bristol-Myers, federal outlays
for prescription drugs could be reduced by several hundred
million dollars a year.
   Merck's plan, which will apply to many federally funded
health centers that serve approximately six million poor and
uninsured people, is set to begin on May 1.
