Technology Brief -- Nikon Corp.:
   Firm Unveils SLR Camera
   Made for Underwater Use
The new camera incorporates automatic focusing and light
exposure metering and a motor drive in an O-ring-sealed
aluminum body, waterproof down to 328 feet below sea level.
Previously, underwater photographers using SLR cameras had to
protect them in bulky waterproof housings.
   The Cousteau camera, the first self-contained amphibious
camera was called the Calypsophot when marketed in 1959. It
was acquired by Nippon Kogaku K.K., now called Nikon Corp.,
in 1962. The camera was renamed Nikonos. Four subsequent
models were marketed.
   Nikon says the Nikonos RS was designed for professionals
and advanced amateurs and won't be on the market until summer
at the earliest. Suggested retail price for the camera body
and standard 28mm lens is $4,000, with an accompanying strobe
light priced at $1,693. Two other lens are available, a 50mm
macro for $1,416 and a 20mm to 35mm zoom for $3,077.
