International:
   Hyundai Says U.S. Sales
   Won't Be Hurt by Strike
Hyundai said it fears that strikers may attempt to
sabotage the plant. They said the factory has produced almost
no vehicles since mid-December, when workers began a work
slowdown.
   A company spokesman said Hyundai dealers in the U.S. have
about two months of inventory, so for now, they likely won't
be affected by the strike. A parts depot in California is
also well-stocked, the spokesman said.
   However, the strike could pose problems for Hyundai's
crucial expansion into Europe. For example, the company has
received 7,800 orders from customers in Germany, where it
began selling cars late last year, but has been unable to
ship any cars since November.
   Hyundai was producing about 20,000 cars a month for export
at Ulsan, but accumulated orders for 37,000 cars remain
unfilled. The company fears that many of these overseas
orders will be rescinded if the strike continues.
