International:
   Ukraine to Pay Its Share
   Of Soviet Debt on Its Own
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Mr. Fokin, who accused Russia of trying to dominate the
financial affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
also asked foreign bankers and multilateral lending agencies
to help Ukraine handle its debt by itself. Ukraine invited
international bankers to Kiev on Feb. 18-19 for a conference
to discuss its plans.
   For now, Ukraine said Russia should suspend its claim to
property of the former Soviet Union, until all assets and
liabilities can be divided among the 15 newly independent
republics.
