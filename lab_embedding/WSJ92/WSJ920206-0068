Taxable Money Fund
   Yields, Assets Decline
   During Latest Week
Assets of the 527 funds tracked by the Ashland, Mass.,
newsletter fell by $788.4 million, to $504.3 billion. Martha
Wittbrodt, editor, said institutional investors withdrew
about $1.6 billion from the funds, while individuals added
$762.9 million.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments -- which
include commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit -- remained
at 56 days.
   Donoghue's said the average seven-day simple yield slipped
to 3.92% from 3.99%. The average 30-day simple yield eased to
4.06% from 4.18% while the average 30-day compound yield fell
to 4.14% from 4.27%.
   Yields on tax-free funds, meanwhile, jumped, which Ms.
Wittbrodt attributed to an increased supply of short-term
municipal securities. The average seven-day compound yield
rose to 2.95% from 2.75%, according to Donoghue's. The latest
yield is equivalent to a taxable 4.10% for an investor in the
28% tax bracket and to 4.28% for someone paying 31% in taxes.
   Assets of 293 tax-exempt funds slid by $33.9 million, to
$97.1 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.
