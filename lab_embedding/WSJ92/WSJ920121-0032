Business Brief -- MinVen Gold Corp.:
   Talks Are Held About Sale
   Of Stock to Pegasus Gold
MinVen also said it is in talks to amend its agreement to
buy United Coin, which is heavily in debt. Previously, it
agreed to swap seven million MinVen shares for United Coin's
14 million shares outstanding. Robert Gilmore, chief
financial officer, said the company will seek to negotiate a
lower purchase price.
   Proceeds from the Pegasus purchase would give MinVen
working capital for United Coin, Mr. Gilmore said. He said
the companies still are negotiating how much stock Pegasus
might buy, but added that if the transaction is completed,
Pegasus would become "a significant shareholder." Pegasus
currently owns 2.3 million MinVen shares, or 6.2% of the
company's approximately 37 million shares outstanding.
