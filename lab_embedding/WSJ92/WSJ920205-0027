Merrill Lynch Files to Offer
   Up to $5 Billion of Debt
The $5 billion shelf filing covers securities that Merrill
expects to sell in the next couple of years, executives said.
Securities firms typically borrow heavily in the markets to
finance their daily trading and other activities.
   When combined with amounts left to sell from previous
Merrill shelf filings, Merrill could sell as much as
$5,053,574,783 of debt and warrants to purchase debt, Merrill
said.
   The securities may be sold directly or through Merrill
Lynch, or through groups that may include Bear Stearns Cos.,
First Boston Corp., Goldman, Sachs  Co., Kidder, Peabody 
Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
