Business Brief -- Wordstar International Inc.:
   Firm Had $3.3 Million Loss
   In Fiscal Second Quarter
Wordstar said the latest quarter included a one-time
charge of $675,000 for costs associated with work force cuts
and a charge of $715,000 for inventory reduction. Higher
marketing costs, a change of manufacturing companies and a
decision to delay the latest version of its flagship word
processing product also hurt results, the company said.
   For the six months, Wordstar posted a loss of $3.2
million, or 22 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier
loss of $1.9 million. Revenue in the most recent six months
was $21.6 million, compared with $16.6 million.
