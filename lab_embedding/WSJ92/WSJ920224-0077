   Texas Instruments
   Wins ITC Judgment
   Against 5 Companies
The five companies include Analog Devices Inc., Norwood,
Mass.; Cypress Semiconductor Corp., San Jose, Calif.;
Integrated Device Technology Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.; LSI
Logic Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.; and VLSI Technology Inc.,
San Jose, Calif.
   However, a spokesman for the California companies called
the order "inconsequential" and said it won't effect
business, since the companies have largely converted to a
different encapsulation process called "top-gating," in which
the plastic is squirted from the top. Analog Devices,
meanwhile, said it has a license under the TI patent allowing
it to import plastic encapsulated products.
   An ITC administrative law judge had earlier found that the
TI patent was valid and that the other companies were
infringing it, but rejected TI's arguments that top-gating
was covered, as well.
   TI, which is based in Dallas, has also filed
patent-infringement suits seeking damages against the five
companies in a Dallas federal court. That case is scheduled
for trial in April.
