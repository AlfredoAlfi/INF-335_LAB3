Two U.S. Exchanges
   Postpone the Trading
   Of Nikkei Warrants
The New York Stock Exchange has also received SEC approval
to list the warrants but hasn't said when it will start
trading them.
   Like an option, a warrant gives its holder the right, but
not the obligation, to sell or purchase a security, currency
or, in this case, the cash equivalent of a market index, at a
specific price on or before a specific date. Nikkei call
warrants increase in value if the Tokyo stock market rises,
and lose value if it falls; put warrant prices respond in the
opposite direction.
   Earlier this month, the Tokyo Stock Exchange asked the SEC
to deny both exchanges permission to trade the warrants,
arguing that the "currently high volatility and the
unprecedentedly thin trading volume in the Tokyo stock market
are due, in main part, to the trading of derivative
products."
   In addition to bets on the Tokyo stock market itself,
Nikkei warrants are used for index arbitrage. This is a
program-trading strategy in which investors dart between the
warrants and their underlying stocks in attempts to profit
from temporary discrepancies in their prices.
