Court Says Frequent Fliers
   Can Sue American Airlines
American claimed state courts shouldn't even hear the
dispute because federal law and the U.S. Constitution
pre-empt state regulation of fares, service or routes. The
court agreed with American partly, saying that the carrier
couldn't be barred from implementing new rules for its
frequent flier program. But the court said damage claims for
consumer fraud and breach of contract weren't covered by
federal law. "These claims bear only a tangential relation to
{American's} rates and services and are not expressly
pre-empted," the court said in its opinion.
   The case will go back to a lower state court to be tried
on its merits. A spokesman for American said the carrier is
still studying its options for appeal.
