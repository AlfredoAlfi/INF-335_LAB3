CBOT Adds St. Louis
   As Delivery Location
   For Soybeans, Wheat
The move is subject to approval by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. If regulatory approval is given, the
first soft red winter wheat contract to include St. Louis
would probably be for delivery in July 1993. The first
soybean contact to include St. Louis would probably be for
delivery in November 1993, according to a CBOT spokesman.
   Traders of agricultural futures contracts usually don't
take physical delivery of the underlying commodity. Grain
exporting firms, for example, use futures contracts to
protect themselves from changes in the price of the crops
they handle. The public uses futures contracts to speculate
on price swings.
   Nonetheless, delivery locations are important because they
help keep the futures market in line with the spot market.
The move follows an intense debate over whether Chicago is
growing obsolete as a delivery point. Relatively little grain
flows through the city anymore. A significant portion of the
Midwest's crops are transported down the Mississippi River
for export through the Gulf of Mexico.
   CBOT Chairman William F. O'Connor said the addition of St.
Louis will help futures contracts "conform better" with the
cash grain markets.
