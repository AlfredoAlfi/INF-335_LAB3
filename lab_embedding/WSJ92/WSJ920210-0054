Immigration Officials Fine
   Peach Packer $1.1 Million
INS investigators said that for at least two years, the
smuggling venture ran 250 alien workers each month to Lane
operations in Georgia and to other harvesters in Florida and
North Carolina. Workers were recruited in the interior of
Mexico.
   The smugglers would typically collect from each worker a
$1,000 transportation fee, $400 for illegal documentation and
$50-a-month rent -- for housing in cramped shacks with poor
sanitation and no air conditioning, said INS Atlanta District
Director Thomas P. Fischer. Workers were paid about $4 an
hour.
   "They had these individuals, both men and women, in their
little bondage-type operation," he said at a news conference.
"They had them with the rent, they had them with the false
cards, they probably used the threat of calling immigration"
to have troublemakers deported.
