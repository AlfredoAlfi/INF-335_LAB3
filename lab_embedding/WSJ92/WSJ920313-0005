Capital Re Is Planning
   Public Offer Valued
   At About $115 Million
The initial public offering also reflects a recent surge
in the public market for companies that insure municipal debt
payments, as cities, towns and government agencies find
investors more skittish about their credit quality.
   An increasing number of municipalities, with big budget
problems and weaker credit ratings, are insuring their debt
issues in order to get investors to come forward. The
insurance can help issuers keep their borrowing costs down by
lowering the yield.
   Reinsurers buy part of the original underwriter's policy,
thus sharing the premium revenue and the risk.
   Capital Re said it filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an offering of 5.5 million shares, which it
expects to price in a range of $18 to $21 each. Of the total,
2.9 million are being sold by the company and 2.6 million by
current shareholders, mainly USFG. A spokeswoman said the
offering, as planned, calls for USFG to sell its entire
stake of 2.5 million shares.
   A spokeswoman for USFG, in Baltimore, confirmed the
planned sale of the insurer's stake in Capital Re. She said
it is "one of a series of actions in our strategy of reducing
equity investments in businesses that are not core insurance
businesses."
