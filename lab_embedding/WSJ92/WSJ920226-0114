Maxus' Rate of Replacement
For the past five years, Maxus has replaced an average of
155% of its production at a finding and development cost of
$3.83 per equivalent barrel. The 1991 replacement figure
doesn't include additional reserves from an increased
interest in Ecuador's Block 16 or from a pending natural-gas
project in the Northwest Java contract area.
