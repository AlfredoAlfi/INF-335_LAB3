Business Brief -- Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co.:
   Pact Reached to Give Stock
   In Unit to Bankers Trust
Although banks are generally prohibited from owning
insurance companies, Bankers Trust, a unit of Bankers Trust
New York Corp., is able to hold stock of the insurer because
it is related to repayment of debt. Eventually, it will
likely sell or dispose of the stock of the company. A
spokesman for the bank declined comment on the size of the
claim.
   At the end of 1991, MB Variable Life had assets of $120
million and sales of $42 million. Also included in the sale
are certain assets of MBL Variable, Inc., a separate Mutual
Benefit subsidiary, including the stock of Directed Services,
Inc. The agreement is subject to court approval.
