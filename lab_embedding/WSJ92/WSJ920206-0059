   Rhode Island Panel
   Indicts Top Officials
   Of Deposit Insurer
Mr. Mollicone disappeared in November 1990, triggering a
run on Heritage. To cover withdrawals, Risdic, which insured
credit unions and small banks in the state, had to pump more
than $14.5 million into Heritage. That drained the insurer's
funds, which contributed to a run on other banks and
eventually prompted state officials to close 45 banks and
credit unions insured by Risdic.
   Some of the institutions, which had large bad-loan
portfolios, remain closed because they were unable to qualify
for federal deposit insurance.
   If convicted, Mr. Nevola, 51 years old, and Mr. Bellucci,
62, face a maximum sentence of 42 years in jail and fines of
$26,000 each. Attorneys for Mr. Bellucci and Mr. Nevola
declined to comment.
   A spokesman for Attorney General James E. O'Neil said Mr.
Bellucci was arrested at his home in Palm City, Fla. Mr.
Nevola will surrender for arraignment at a later date, the
spokesman said.
