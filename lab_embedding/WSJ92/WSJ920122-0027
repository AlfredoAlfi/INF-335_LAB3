Dingell Is Examining SEC
   For `Improper Interference'
A letter sent last week to Mr. Breeden asks the SEC chief
to identify "any and all . . . Executive Branch
interventions" over the past three years, as well as "any
actions taken as a result of the same." The report to the
subcommittee "should include all efforts of the
administration to undermine or change SEC regulations or the
independence of your agency," the letter said.
   "The SEC will respond to Chairman Dingell's request
promptly," Mr. Breeden said. "I, of course, share the
chairman's concern for the integrity of the SEC, and I will
be happy to confirm for Chairman Dingell that the SEC has
consistently acted in the light of its own free and
independent judgment."
   Mr. Dingell, whose full House Energy and Commerce
Committee oversees the SEC, has chided Mr. Breeden in the
past for international trips the SEC chairman took over the
past two years. Mr. Breeden has contended that he was simply
doing the job of the agency chairman in an international
marketplace.
