Technology:
   Hewlett-Packard Co.
   And Prime Computer
   Enter Resale Accord
John J. Shields, Prime's president, said the agreement
will give buyers of Prime's ComputerVision software a choice
of the industry's three most popular workstations to choose
from, those of Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems Inc. and
Digital Equipment Corp.
   Mr. Shields said the agreement with Hewlett-Packard will
also help owners of Prime's older computers switch to newer
machines based on advanced RISC or reduced instruction set
computing designs.
   Prime's agreement with Hewlett-Packard, and earlier
agreements with Digital and Sun, are part of the company's
strategy of shifting away from sales of its own,
proprietary-design minicomputers toward the resale of other
company's systems, loaded with Prime software.
   Prime's ComputerVision unit is a major supplier of
computer-aided design software for electronics and mechanical
engineering. But sales of Prime's own line of computers is
eroding rapidly. In the third quarter ended Sept. 28, Prime
reported a 17% drop in revenue to $315.8 million from $378.7
million in the 1990 quarter.
