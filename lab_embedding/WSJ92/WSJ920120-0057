Business Brief -- Mercom Inc.:
   Cable TV Company Expects
   $7.6 Million Net Loss in '91
Charles E. Parente, Mercom's newly appointed chief
executive officer, said that Mercom faces "significant
challenges" in the months ahead, including the need to secure
adequate long-term financing.
   As of Dec. 31, Mercom's liabilities exceeded its assets by
$11 million, the company said. James Bogdan, Mercom's chief
financial officer, said it was not unusual for cable
television companies to have negetive net worth because of
high start-up costs, but that $11 million was high for a
company this small. Mercom has 33,000 suscribers in
southeastern Michigan.
