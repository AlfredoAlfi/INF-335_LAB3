Business Brief -- UAL Corp.:
   United Airlines Unit Plans
   To Lay Off 439 Employees
The layoffs come amid heavy losses at UAL. The airline
holding company posted a record fourth-quarter net loss of
$252.6 million, compared with a net loss of $123.5 million in
the year-earlier quarter.
   United Chairman Stephen Wolf apparently is trying to
reassure the rank-and-file he doesn't plan widespread cuts.
In a message to employees Monday, Mr. Wolf said employees are
asking him: "Do we plan a major cutback in United's operation
and associated employee layoffs?" He responded, "Unlike our
competitors, our answer at United continues to be no." He
said that "this response cannot be assured into the
indefinite future," but said the company planned to avert
layoffs by reducing or eliminating "every possible
discretionary expense."
