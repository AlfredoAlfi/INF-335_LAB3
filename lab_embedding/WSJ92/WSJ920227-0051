Business Brief -- Asahi Glass Co.:
   Japanese Firm's 1991 Profit
   Declined 19% Before Taxes
The company said sales of flat glass and construction
materials were particularly hurt by a fall in Japanese
housing demand, while sales of fabricated glass stagnated
because of a downturn in Japan's auto industry. However,
sales of specialty, high-performance glass continued to show
strong growth, Asahi said.
   Although group sales did creep up 1.1% from a year
earlier, that gain was outstripped by rising raw material and
marketing costs, the company said.
   For 1992, the company said it expects group pretax profit
to climb 12% to 71 billion yen.
