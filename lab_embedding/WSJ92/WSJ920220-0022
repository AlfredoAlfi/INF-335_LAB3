Business Brief -- Tecnol Medical Products Inc.:
   Firm Won't Purchase Stock
   In Anago Until Judge Rules
On Feb. 10, Anago filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court
in Dallas accusing Tecnol of securities-law violations in
connection with its acquistion of an undisclosed number of
Anago shares. On Feb. 7, Tecnol proposed acquiring Anago for
$14 million, which included the price of shares it already
holds. Anago has described the offer as a "hostile takeover"
attempt and seeks to reverse Tecnol's purchase of its shares.
   Tecnol said in a news release that the judge hearing the
case had asked both parties to file legal briefs by today.
Although Tecnol executives could not be reached for comment,
a spokesman said the company eventually plans to "proceed
with the acquisition."
