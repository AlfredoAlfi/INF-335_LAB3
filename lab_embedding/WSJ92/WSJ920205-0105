Business Brief -- Joy Technologies Inc.:
   Patent Infringement Lawsuit
   Is Won by the Company
A jury in the Federal District Court in Delaware ruled
Jan. 24 that Flakt Inc., a U.S. affiliate of Asea Brown
Boveri Ltd. of Switzerland, infringed on Joy's patent on
technology for reducing air pollution by recycling lime and
fly ash. Joy said it will sue for "millions" of dollars in
damages and for a court order that would stop Flakt from
using the technology. Flakt officials didn't return phone
calls seeking comment.
   In another legal matter, Joy settled a lawsuit Sept. 30
against a former subcontractor, closely held R-V Industries
Inc., Honeybrook, Pa., which had previously refused to return
drawings, designs, manuals, plans, blueprints and data, Joy
said.
