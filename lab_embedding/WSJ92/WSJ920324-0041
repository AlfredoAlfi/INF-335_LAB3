Business Brief -- Score Board Inc.:
   Profit and Revenue Rose
   In the Year Ended Jan. 31
Score Board shares fell $2.50 a share yesterday, closing
at $37.25 in national over-the-counter trading. Analysts
attributed the drop to profit-taking.
   The company is perhaps best-known for its autographed
baseballs, jerseys and other sports items. Last year, it
began selling Star Trek collectibles, and its chairman, Paul
Golding, said it plans to introduce a National Football
League Trivia Board Game this year.
