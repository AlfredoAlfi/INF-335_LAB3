Ultimate Corp. Posts
   Third-Quarter Loss;
   Recession Is Factor
The quarter's results included a $2 million non-cash
write-down of certain software distribution rights to reflect
their "realizable value" in market.
   "Potential customers are still postponing decisions on new
systems," while small businesses continue to experience "the
effects of the money crunch," said Michael J. O'Donnell,
chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Alexander W. Giles, chief financial officer, said debt is
being repaid from cash flow on or ahead of schedule, and that
cash flow and cash balances are "sufficient to support
operations for the foreseeable future." He said Chase
Manhattan Bank has waived the company's non-compliance with a
loan covenant, and will discuss mofidying the covenants to
"more realistically reflect anticipated business conditions."
   For the nine months, Ultimate had a net loss of $13.9
million, or $1.52 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss
of $41.3 million, or $4.61 a share. Revenue fell 19% to
$112.2 million from $138.5 million. The results for the 1990
period include restructuring and other charges of about $42
million.
