   Virgin Atlantic Begins
   Libel Proceedings
   Against British Air
Virgin Atlantic, a unit of Virgin Group PLC controlled by
Richard Branson, declined to provide details of British Air's
alleged libel. But the company said the suit arose from
numerous comments in a British Air newsletter and a news
release that apparently amounted to a curt dismissal by
British Air of Virgin's unfair tactics charges.
   "The manner in which BA and Lord King have attacked both
Virgin Atlantic and myself, by dismissing Virgin's claims as
fabrications, leaves me no choice but to proceed in this
way," Mr. Branson said.
   The feud between the two airlines has been simmering for
about a year but has heated up since last July when Virgin
won rights to begin flying U.S. routes from Heathrow, the hub
of the British Air empire. Virgin has subsequently undercut
British Air fares to U.S. routes and has also been awarded
licenses to certain lucrative routes, including those to
South Africa, that were previously British Air monopolies.
   Virgin in January appealed to the European Community,
which has a say in Pan-European airline matters, complaining
of allegedly "uncompetitive" behavior by British Air.
