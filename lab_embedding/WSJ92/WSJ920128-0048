Marketing Brief -- Mattel Inc.:
   Pact Set With Rollerblade
   To Sell Two Lines of Dolls
Rollerblade skates, introduced in 1980 as an off-season
training tool for hockey players, have a single blade-like
row of wheels and look something like a cross between
traditional roller skates and ice skates. Rollerblade, based
in Minneapolis, said the dolls will help introduce girls to
its new line of children's skates.
