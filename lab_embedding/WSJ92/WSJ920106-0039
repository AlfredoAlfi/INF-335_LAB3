Memorex Telex Gets
   Enough Creditor Votes
   For Revamping Plan
Memorex said Friday that it expects to file its plan of
reorganization shortly. A spokesman said that would likely be
in a few days, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
   In a prepackaged Chapter 11 filing, a company enters
bankruptcy court proceedings already having won most
creditors' approval in an effort to expedite the
reorganization process. Memorex Telex in July said it already
had approval of more than 55% of bank lenders and senior
junk-bond holders, and more than 60% of subordinated
junk-bond holders. It said then that it would seek approval
of at least two-thirds of those groups before filing a
prepackaged plan.
   Memorex, based in the Netherlands, has most of its
operations in the U.S., with its headquarters here.
