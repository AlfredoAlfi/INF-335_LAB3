International Brief -- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya:
   Consolidated Profit Increased
   3.3% to $1.08 Billion in '91
The bank will pay a 1991 dividend of 163 pesetas, up five
pesetas from 1990.
   Net interest revenue, which fell in the first half,
increased 3.2% in the year to 344.2 billion pesetas from
333.5 billion pesetas a year earlier.
   Spanish banks were stung last year by a spectacular fall
in corporate profits, which increased bad debts and prompted
bank clients to roll back investment programs, Mr. Ibarra
said.
   Created in 1988 through the merger of two regional banks,
BBV began to exploit its size last year by aggressively
selling money-market funds that offer clients high yields and
tax efficiency.
