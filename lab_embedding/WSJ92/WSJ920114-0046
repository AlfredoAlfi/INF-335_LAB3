Enzo Biochem Stock
   Leaps as Unit Unveils
   Diagnostic Products
Enzo shares were quoted at $5.75, up $2.50, in late
trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday.
   Also at the meeting, Enzo Biochem reiterated its offer to
holders of its 9% convertible subordinated debentures due
2001 to convert the debentures into equity this month, a
spokeswoman said. The company last year had some problems
making interest payments on its debt and sought to convert
the debt into equity.
   The eight products are additions to Enzo's group of
monoclonal antibody products for cancer research. Seven are
monoclonal antibodies, which help pathologists identify and
characterize undifferentiated tumors stemming from lymphomas,
leukemias or prostate, colo-rectal and neuronrelated cancers.
A staining kit for detecting the 18 monoclonals the company
markets for research also was introduced.
