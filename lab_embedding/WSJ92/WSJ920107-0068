Journal to Publish Fund Indexes
Previously, seven of the fund indexes were listed each
Monday. Indexes for these types of funds will now be computed
daily: growth, growth and income, equity income, balanced,
gold, science and technology, and international. In addition,
indexes on capital appreciation and small-company growth
funds will appear daily.
   All indexes will be computed on a preliminary basis
because of publication deadlines, but the daily changes shown
in the table will be based on final index values of the
previous day.
   Two indexes of foreign-registered funds will continue to
be published weekly, on Mondays.
