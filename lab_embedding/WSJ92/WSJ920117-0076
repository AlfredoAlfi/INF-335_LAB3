California Resumes Ties
In August, the treasurer suspended certain investment
activities with the Salomon Inc. unit, including the direct
or secondary purchase of Salomon commercial paper and
repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions with the firm.
The decision was made pending federal investigations into
alleged violations of Treasury-auction bidding procedures.
   Since August, Mrs. Brown said, Salomon has replaced
managers allegedly responsible for the improper auction
activities and cooperated fully with pending investigations.
In addition, other funds, including the $68 billion
California Public Employees Retirement System fund, have
recently resumed business dealings with Salomon after a
similar decision in December by the World Bank.
