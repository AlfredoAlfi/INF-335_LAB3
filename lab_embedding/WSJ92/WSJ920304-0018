Business Brief -- Qual-Med Inc.:
   Managed-Care Firm Expects
   Strong 4th Quarter, Year
For the year, the Pueblo, Colo., managed-care provider
expects big revenue and profit gains, thanks to the
acquisition of a major California health maintenance
organization. Dr. Hasan said Qual-Med expects net income for
the year of between $17.5 million and $18.5 million, or $1.26
to $1.28 a share, compared with $4.6 million, or 38 cents a
share, in 1990. Revenue is expected to be between $282.5
million and $284 million, up from $142.1 million in 1990.
   Dr. Hasan said the company, which is pursuing four
additional acquisitions, could double revenues again in 1992.
"I'd be very surprised if we didn't reach $500 million this
year," he said.
   Qual-Med uses a patient information computer system and
strict supervision by 18 medical directors to cure
financially troubled HMOs. The company also negotiates
discounted fees from hospitals and doctors in private
practice.
