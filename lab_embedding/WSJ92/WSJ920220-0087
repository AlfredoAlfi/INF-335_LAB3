Shawmut Ex-Officer Pleads
   Guilty to Embezzlement
The accounts were set up in Boston, New Hampshire, Florida
and Switzerland under fictitious names. Money was diverted to
accounts from November 1987 to July 1991, when a wire
transfer totaling $580,000 to a Florida account was
discovered.
   Mr. Regan was subsequently fired. The bank, which is
seeking restitution, has recovered some of the money.
   U.S. District Court Judge A. David Mazzone scheduled
sentencing for April 21. Mr. Regan could be sentenced to five
to 30 years in prison and fined $250,000 to $1 million for
each of the 55 counts to which he has pleaded guilty.
