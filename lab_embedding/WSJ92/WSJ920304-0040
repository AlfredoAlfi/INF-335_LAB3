   Ford, Mazda Ready
   To Fix Transmissions
   On 765,367 Vehicles
Ford said it's now able to fix defective automatic
transmissions in 755,700 of its 1990 Ranger compact pickup
trucks, 1990-91 Aerostar minivans and 1991 Explorer
sport-utility vehicles.
   A Ford spokeswoman said the company received 500 reports
of automatic transmissions that slipped out of park and
allowed the vehicles to roll. "There were a handful of minor
injuries and no deaths" associated with the faulty
transmissions, the spokeswoman said.
   Mazda, based in Hiroshima, Japan, said its previously
announced recall affected 9,667 Navajo sport-utility
vehicles, which are built for Mazda by Ford. "Mazda received
some field reports of cars rolling, starting in June 1991,
but there have been no reports of accidents, injuries or
deaths," a Mazda spokesman said.
   Separately, Ford said it is recalling 950 of its 1990
F-Series medium trucks with seven-liter engines to replace
faulty bypass valves and air pumps emitting unacceptable
carbon monoxide exhaust levels.
   Both Ford and Mazda are notifying owners by mail and will
make all repairs at no charge.
