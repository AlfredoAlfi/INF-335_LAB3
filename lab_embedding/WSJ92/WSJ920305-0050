   Two Banks, in Norway
   And Sweden, Register
   Huge Losses for 1991
Christiania Bank's 1991 net loss widened to 9.17 billion
kroner ($1.41 billion) from 1.85 billion kroner a year
earlier. The 1991 results include one-time charges of 2.27
billion kroner in asset write-downs and one-time
restructuring costs, most of which were taken in the third
quarter, when losses wiped out the bank's remaining
shareholders' funds and led to a state-sponsored
recapitalization.
   Sweden's No. 2 bank Nordbanken said it swung to a pretax
loss of 8.5 billion Swedish kronor ($1.41 billion) from a
break-even result the previous year.
   Sour loans to a handful of major customers -- mainly
property-related credits dating from the late 1980s -- drove
loan-loss provisions to 10.5 billion kronor, or 3.9% of total
loans outstanding, from 4.24 billion kronor, or 1.3% of total
loans in 1990.
