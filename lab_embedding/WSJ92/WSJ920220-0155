   Broken Hill Proprietary Co.
However, the company attributed the gains mainly to plant
closures and shipping problems in the year-earlier month,
rather than to stronger demand in the latest period.
   Domestic steel despatches for the eight months to January
fell 12% to 2.06 million tons from 2.33 million tons. Exports
rose 12% to 1.44 million tons from 1.29 million tons as BHP
tried to offset recession-affected Australian sales with
higher exports.
   The company also reported that its raw-steel production
rose 33% to 574,000 tons in January from 431,000 tons in
January 1991. Here, too, the year-earlier figure was affected
by a plant closure.
   Raw-steel production for the latest eight months rose 2%
to 4.21 million tons from 4.12 million tons.
