U.S. Will Change Policy
   On Court Curbs for Prisons
Now, the Justice Department generally will "support
termination . . . of all litigation that limits the ability
of a state to run its own prison facilities," Mr. Barr said
in a speech to prosecutors in Palm Springs, Calif., according
to a text made available here. He added, however, that the
department "will continue to protect vigorously the
constitutional rights of state prisoners."
   In justifying the policy change, Mr. Barr cited recent
Supreme Court decisions that narrowed the circumstances under
which a prison system would be found in violation of the
constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
The attorney general said the Justice Department generally
stands ready to back states as long as prison officials don't
act with "deliberate indifference to the minimal civilized
measure of life's necessities."
   Federal courts lack authority to interfere with prison
management based on findings that the "overall conditions in
the prison are bad or substandard, where no specific
deprivation of a human need is demonstrated," Mr. Barr told
the prosecutors.
