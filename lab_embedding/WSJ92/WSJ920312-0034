International Brief --  UNI Storebrand AS:
   Norwegian Insurer Reports
   40% Rise in Pretax Profit
UNI Storebrand holds a 28% Skandia stake and Hafnia 14.8%.
Together with allies, the two insurers claim to control more
than 50% of Skandia. A combined UNI Storebrand/Skandia/Hafnia
would rank among the half-dozen biggest European insurers,
measured by premium income.
   UNI Storebrand's 1991 financial report underscored speedy
integration since the company was formed through the June
1990 merger of Norway's No.1 and No. 3 insurers -- the former
Storebrand AS and UNI Forsikring.
