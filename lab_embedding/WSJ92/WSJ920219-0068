Business Brief -- Dominion Textile Inc.:
   Fabrics Unit to Be Closed,
   Resulting in 624 Job Losses
The Montreal textile concern said it will shut Dominion
Fabrics' fabric-weaving plant in Long Sault, Ontario, over
the next three months and the unit's fabric-finishing plant
in St. Timothee, Quebec, over the next three to six months.
Dominion Fabrics employs 365 people at Long Sault, 225 at St.
Timothee, and 34 at offices in Montreal and Toronto.
   Dominion Textile said the costs of the shutdown were
provided for as part of a C$68 million restructuring charge
taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1991. Dominion Textile
said the decision to shut Dominion Fabrics doesn't affect a
plant in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, that custom finishes fabric
supplied by customers and a denim plant in Drummondville,
Quebec. Dominion Textile said production of some fabrics made
by Dominion Fabric will be transferred to other company
units.
