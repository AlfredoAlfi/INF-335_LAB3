   Oh, What Fun to Shop
   In Winter Wonderland
Yes, Wal-Mart and other discounters may offer slightly
lower prices -- and this is well and good -- but don't look
down on department stores for their inspired Christmas
ambiance. It is a real pleasure just to wander through them.
   Among my memories was seeing the intriguing mechanized
elves in the windows of The Boston Store in Milwaukee. Lower
prices at discounters can't take away the wonder I felt as a
child. I know others feel the same way.
