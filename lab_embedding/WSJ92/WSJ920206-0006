   Bush Stops Taking Halcion
   Amid Concern Over Its Use
"He has taken it on trips in the past, but he doesn't take
it on a daily basis," Mr. Fitzwater said. "He's not taking it
now due to the controversy over its use." Mr. Fitzwater noted
Mr. Bush believes Halcion is a safe product.
   Halcion is banned or restricted in 11 countries because of
side effects that have been reported to include confusion,
amnesia, anxiety, paranoia, extreme excitability and
dizziness.
   The Upjohn Co. product, which is legal in the United
States and about 90 other countries, is the most popular
sleeping pill prescribed in this country.
   Researchers have said it is safe and effective when used
in the recommended dosage and for short periods of time.
