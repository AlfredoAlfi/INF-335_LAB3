Key Conservative Plans
   Speech Critical of Bush
Mr. Feulner, who in the past has urged conservatives to
give Mr. Bush the benefit of the doubt, says the
administration has a "philosophical vacuum," has "given the
conservative cause a black eye" and has "all but invited
challenge from the right."
   In his speech, Mr. Feulner adds: "If the admininstration
wants to destroy itself, that is its prerogative. But it's
quite another when this suicidal impulse threatens to take us
with them."
   Mr. Feulner calls on Mr. Bush to offer tax cuts for
middle-income families, limits on domestic spending, a
renewed commitment to deregulation and a "vigorous defense"
of free trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement now
being negotiated.
   "Anything less will only enhance the current impression,
which is being echoed in corporate board rooms and union
halls alike, that the ship of state is without a helmsman,"
he says.
