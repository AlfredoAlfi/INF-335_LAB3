Federal Appeals Court
   Upholds California's
   Product Labeling Law
The law, known as the California Safe Drinking Water and
Toxic Enforcement Act, was a ballot initiative passed by
California voters in 1986. It requires the posting of
warnings about products causing cancer or birth defects,
among other provisions. The state prepares a list of products
it considers dangerous, and manufacturers are given a choice
of complying through either product labels or point-of-sale
signs.
   The chemical manufacturers' trade group couldn't be
reached to comment on the ruling. It has the option of
seeking a rehearing before the appeals court or a U.S.
Supreme Court review.
