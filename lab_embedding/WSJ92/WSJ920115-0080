Five Mall Owners Ask
   Court to Set Aside
   Grafton Unit Ruling
Grafton-Fraser has until Feb. 15 to come up with a
restructuring plan. The company said recently it is closing
107 of its 241 stores as part of the reorganization.
   Cadillac senior vice president Peter Sharpe said the
landlords want a trustee appointed to oversee the
reorganization because they have millions of dollars in
leases with Grafton-Fraser but are being given only seven
days' notice of store closings and have no voice in deciding
what locations are closed. Mr. Sharpe said 10 Grafton-Fraser
stores have closed in Cadillac malls.
   "We would like to know what the full {restructuring}
proposal is so that we can make our business decisions based
on that," he said.
   John Hick, president of Grafton Group, said that if the
landlords succeed in their motion, any possibility of a
restructuring to save jobs and stores will be lost.
   The landlords' application is scheduled to be heard by the
court on Jan. 23.
   Grafton Group of Toronto yesterday reported a net loss of
58.5 million Canadian dollars (US$50.8 million), or C$3.17 a
share, on revenue of C$202.7 million for the nine months
ended Oct. 31. Grafton Group also owns a Canadian shoe
retailer, Maher Inc., and the Seiferts women's apparel stores
in the U.S.
