   Johnson  Johnson
   Says FDA Licensed
   Test for Hepatitis C
The new test is more sensitive in detecting the antibody
to the hepatitis C virus, which is thought to be responsible
for more than 90% of the world's hepatitis cases related to
blood transfusions. Johnson  Johnson said it is the first
test licensed in the U.S. using multiple hepatitis C antigens
and replaces a single-antigen test developed by Ortho and
Chiron and licensed in May 1990.
   The American Association of Blood Banks, responding to the
announcement, said it will replace existing hepatitis C
screening tests with the new test at its 2,400 blood banks.
   Separately, Johnson  Johnson said a federal court in
Connecticut denied a motion for a temporary restraining order
filed as part of a patent-infringement suit by U.S. Surgical
Corp. U.S. Surgical, based in Norwalk, Conn., is Johnson 
Johnson's major rival in the market for surgical products
used in minimally invasive procedures.
   The restraining order would have halted the sale by
Johnson  Johnson's unit, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, of a
multiple-clip applier used in laparoscopic gall bladder
surgery. A hearing on U.S. Surgical's charges of patent
infringement is expected in the future.
