Banc One Unit to Manage
   Assets of Five Failed Banks
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The choice of Banc One signals a change in FDIC policy
that allows problem assets inherited by the agency to be
managed by companies not involved in a bank's rescue.
   Banc One Management, however, has long experience making
collections for the FDIC. Its subsidiary, Bonnet Resources
Corp., is about halfway through collecting FDIC-held assets
from MCorp., a 20-bank chain in Texas that failed in 1989.
   Awarding of the contract, due to be publicly announced
this morning, marks a final chapter of the New Hampshire
banking crisis, in which the state's five largest independent
banks collapsed. Last fall, the FDIC sold Dartmouth Bancorp,
Numerica Financial Corp. and New Hampshire Savings Bank, with
combined assets of $2.19 billion, to an investor group that
now runs them as a combined entity, New Dartmouth Bank. The
other two failed banks, Amoskeag Bank Shares Inc. and
BankEast Corp., with combined assets of $1.8 billion, were
sold by the FDIC to Bank of Ireland's First New Hampshire
Bank unit.
