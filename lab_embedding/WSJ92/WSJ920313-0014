Mitsubishi Materials said that while it had planned to use
what it called a "virtually pollution-free" smelting process,
the project faltered on environmental considerations. The
spokesman said there were more than a dozen public hearings
on concerns about possible water pollution from the plant,
spurred by what he called a small number of environmental
activists.
   Mitsubishi Materials finally received approval from the
state for the discharge of water from the plant, but with
conditions attached suggesting that the smelter might be
prohibited from discharging any smelting-related waste water
after five years of operation, the spokesman said. He said
the company had rejected as too costly the alternative of
evaporating the waste water by heating it.
   Mitsubishi Materials, which set up Texas Copper Corp. in
April 1989, said it spent $10 million on a feasibility study
for the plant, lawyer fees and other costs. The company said
it doesn't have an alternative site.
