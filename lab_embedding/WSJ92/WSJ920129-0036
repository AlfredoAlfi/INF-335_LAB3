Business Brief -- Lifetime Products Inc.:
   Lawsuit Bars Stock Option
   From Being Retired Now
Lifetime itself isn't named in the lawsuit, but it must
wait until the action is dismissed or resolved before
proceeding with its plans. Lifetime shareholders last month
approved a new class of preferred stock as a way of retiring
the option, which was granted in 1985 before the company
merged with a windshield-wiper maker.
   The Kansas action was filed by Larry Doskocil, founder of
Doskocil Cos., and Ronald Bretches and charges that three
former Lifetime directors, James J. Pinto, Richard A.
Bartlett and John C. Shaw, conspired to acquire the valuable
option for themselves.
   In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lifetime shares closed at $6.375, down 62.5 cents.
   Based on that price, the shares in the option, which can
be purchased for $937,500, have a market value of $17.8
million.
