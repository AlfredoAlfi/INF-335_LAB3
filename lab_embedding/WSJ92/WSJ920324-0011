   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The 7.1% drop in February was the biggest annual fall
since June, when vehicle production declined 7.9%.
   "Consumers' minds remained cautious" because of the
country's economic slowdown, the association said.
   Demand fell particularly sharply for small passenger cars,
which make up the majority of car sales in Japan. Meanwhile,
demand for midsized cars remained steady, reflecting
consumers' preference for larger cars, an association
official said.
   The association also estimated Japan's motor-vehicle
exports in February increased around 3%. The association will
report the export data this week.
   Passenger cars produced in February totaled 784,531, down
6.2%. Within the total, small-sized car production fell 15.7%
to 510,958, while midsized car production increased 31.4% to
207,910. Minicar production declined 8.5% to 65,663.
   Truck production dropped 10.1% to 267,317. Small-sized
trucks declined 6.7% to 97,740, and midsized trucks fell 8.8%
to 94,805. Mini-trucks fell 15.7% to 74,772.
   A total of 4,057 buses were produced, up 14.3%. The number
of large-sized buses increased 8.2% to 1,601, while
small-sized buses rose 18.8% to 2,456.
