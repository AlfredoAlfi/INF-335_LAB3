Mirage Resorts Plans
   First Mortgage Notes
   Offer of $200 Million
The new notes will be secured on an equal level with the
first mortgage debt of the Mirage casino-hotel and GNS
Finance Corp., through a deed of trust representing a first
lien on the Mirage and the new project, Treasure Island.
   The Treasure Island resort, to be located next to the
Mirage on a prime location on Las Vegas's Strip, is now
budgeted at about $400 million including carrying costs and
pre-opening expenses. Stephen A. Wynn, Mirage's chairman and
chief exeutive, had previously set the budget at about $300
million, "give or take 10%." The rest of the financing will
come from cash on hand, a Mirage spokesman said.
   The 3,000-room resort will include a casino designed to
appeal to middle-income customers, and is scheduled to open
in late 1993. The front of the project will boast a 360-foot
theaterlike area where mock pirate ships will stage gun
battles.
   The announcement boosted Mirage's stock, which rose $1.375
a share to close at $27.75 a share in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading. The filing comes in the wake of some
speculation by competitors that Mirage would defer the
project in light of weak market conditions in Las Vegas.
