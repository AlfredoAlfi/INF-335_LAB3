Business Brief -- American Telephone  Telegraph:
   Staff at Plant in Oklahoma
   Is Trimmed by 8%, or 400
An ATT spokeswoman said the layoffs in Oklahoma City were
done to "adjust to order levels" for the products built at
the plant. Those products include ATT's flagship switching
system used by telephone companies, the 5ESS, as well as its
3B line of computers.
   Some of the workers, she said, may be "recalled when (the
plant) needs more people."
