International Brief -- Gencor Ltd.:
   South African Mining Firm
   To Make Rights Offering
Gencor shares yesterday fell 15 cents to close at 12.10
rand.
   Proceeds from the rights issue would be used mostly for
expansion and project developments.
   Gencor plans a three billion rand expansion to its Alusaf
aluminum smelting project.
   Gencor's joint Columbus stainless steel venture with South
African mining house Anglo American Corp. of South Africa
Ltd. has been suspended since September 1990 due to high
inflation and South Africa's almost 50% corporate tax rate.
   Engen, Gencor's oil subsidiary, invested 670 million rand
to increase capacity at its Genref oil refinery by 50%.
   "It is well known that Gencor is currently either engaged
in or examining a number of large projects, including
Columbus, the Alusaf expansion and Phase 2 of the Genref
refinery expansion," said Gencor Executive Chairman Brian
Gilbertson.
