Court Urged to Enforce
   Subpoenas on Kaye Scholer
Yesterday afternoon, the law firm and the thrift office
began settlement negotiations before U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin.
   The thrift office is seeking documents and testimony from
several partners and associates in the firm's work
representing Charles H. Keating Jr., former chairman of
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp.,
Phoenix, Ariz.
   The regulators issued the subpoenas last August, October
and November, court papers said.
   Regulators estimate that Lincoln's failure will cost
taxpayers roughly $2 billion.
   Earlier this week, the federal court ruled in a similar
case that accounting firm Ernst  Young had to comply with a
government subpoena seeking work papers for 23 failed
thrifts.
