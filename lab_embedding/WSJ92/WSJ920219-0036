Business Brief -- Illinois Tool Works Inc.:
   Fourth-Period Profit Rises
   By 3.1%, Revenue by 4.1%
Weak currency translations, which resulted from the
dollar's rise, lowered earnings in the latest quarter by
three cents a share, Illinois Tool said. The company said its
international operations also were hurt by the continued weak
economies in Canada, Australia and the U.K. Domestic
operations, meanwhile, posted higher results.
   For all of 1991, the company's earnings slipped 1% to
$180.6 million, or $3.25 a share, from $182.4 million, or
$3.35 a share, a year earlier, when there were fewer shares
outstanding. Revenue rose 3.8% to $2.64 billion from $2.54
billion.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Illinois Tool shares fell 75 cents to $66.625.
