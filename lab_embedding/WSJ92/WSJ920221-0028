Technology:
   New Refrigerator Designed
   Without CFCs Saves Energy
The EPA said Americans could save $1 billion to $2 billion
annually on electricity bills, which would almost equal the
cost to the economy of fully phasing out CFC production. John
Hoffman, director of the global change division, said current
refrigerators use the same air in the freezer section and the
fresh-food section. The new technology would cool the
compartments separately, allowing the refrigerants to be more
effective at providing the desired temperature in each
compartment and helping freezers smell better.
   Whirlpool Corp. has run similar tests and nearly matched
the 8% savings measured by the researchers.
   CFCs damage the stratospheric ozone layer, which helps
shield the Earth from harmful ultrviolet radiation.
