The agency has sold or closed 630 of the 703 SLs it
seized. It also sold $234.1 billion in SL assets, with $128
billion remaining, a sign, Mr. Casey said, that it's time to
start shrinking the bailout bureaucracy. "It's time to
eliminate the duplicative reviews that are sometimes
necessary when you have a new agency and staff," Mr. Casey
said.
   The move, which is intended to streamline asset sales
operations, isn't without risk. The biggest botched effort of
the agency so far occurred when its Denver office tried in
1990 to close more than 100 SLs in three months. The
regional office fell behind in accounting, leaving books at
the seized SLs temporarily $6 billion out of balance with
regional ledgers.
   Under the changes announced yesterday, offices in Atlanta,
Dallas, Denver and Kansas City, Mo., which oversaw regional
operations and provided administrative support, will be
closed by June 30, leaving other offices in these cities to
pick up their chores.
   By the end of next January, sales offices will close in
Phoenix, Ariz.; Tampa, Fla.; Baton Rouge, La.; Minneapolis;
Tulsa, Okla.; and San Antonio, Texas. Sales offices in
Chicago, Houston and Somerset, Pa., will be closed by Sept.
30, 1993. Many of the field staff jobs were temporary, and
others will be transferred back to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   The RTC also said it plans to sell $100 billion in assets
by the end of the year.
