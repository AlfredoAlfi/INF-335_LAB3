International:
   Nissan Is Attempting
   To Boost Purchases
   Of U.S. Auto Parts
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Companies that aren't long-term suppliers are generally
relegated to providing low-profit "off-the-shelf" components,
rather than custom-designed parts, since development can take
four years.
   "Our intent is to begin to draw the U.S. companies into
the design process," a Nissan spokesman said.
   Nissan President Yutaka Kume, meanwhile, said he had "full
confidence" in U.S. workers and products made at Nissan's
plant in Tennessee "are as good as those we turn out in
Japan."
   Mr. Kume told reporters that both countries should make
more efforts to reduce their trade imbalance, three-quarters
of which comes from the auto sector.
   Separately, Nissan's pretax profit for the fiscal year
through March 31, 1992, has been "squeezed" by rising costs
and falling demand, Mr. Kume said.
   But he didn't respond directly to a question about a
report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business
newspaper, that pretax profit for Japan's second largest auto
maker would be 10 billion yen ($79.2 million) below the
company's prediction for the fiscal year.
   Nissan also said its U.S. unit's local production should
outstrip imports from Japan within this year as production
capacity nearly doubles.
