Xytronyx, Directors
   Charged by Holder
   With Securities Fraud
Peter Baram, Xytronyx chairman and chief executive
officer, said "the suit is without merit." The company has
always kept its shareholders "informed of material
information," he said.
   Xytronyx has said that it hopes the gum disease test kit
will become its first product.
   On Nov. 15, the company disclosed that the Food and Drug
Administration had found "several deficiencies" in the
company's FDA marketing application for the gum disease test
kit. Xytronyx stock lost more than half its value that day,
plunging to $13.25, down $14.375 in American Stock Exchange
trading. Yesterday, Xytronyx shares fell $2.50 to $16.
