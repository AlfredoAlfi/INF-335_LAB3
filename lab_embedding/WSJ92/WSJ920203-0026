Economy:
   Tracking the Economy
   ----
   By Andrew Sobel
Nonfarm payrolls were probably unchanged in January, says
Carol Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities Inc. in
New York.
   Ms. Stone's forecast of this week's key economic data
weighs weakness in manufacturing and construction with modest
strength in certain service industries.
   She estimates the January unemployment rate may have crept
up as high as 7.3%. It likely won't stop there, she says;
expect a climb to around 7.5% sometime in the second quarter.
   It's a "sluggish labor market," Ms. Stone says. While
"there's not a whole lot of deterioration, there's certainly
no sign of a rebound" either, she says.
   The lack of jobs won't do much to restore consumer
confidence, especially if the average work-week shortened a
bit in January, as the Nomura economist estimates.
   "I'm tempted to say the American people are more patient
than the American media," she says, "but it's hard for
individuals to be too patient when they lose their own job or
see one of their neighbors get laid off. And that remains
fairly widespread."
   Meanwhile, she says, people are skeptical about last
week's spate of fiscal stimuli.
   "I know of no obvious way out of the doldrums," she says.
For now, the best bet is to wait until the nascent
housing-sector rebound "gets better roots and begins to
grow."
