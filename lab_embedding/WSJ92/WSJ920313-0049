International:
   Brazil Says Its Economy
   Advanced 1.2% Last Year

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Farm production recovered from a 3.7% decline in 1990 and
grew 2% last year, the national statistics bureau said. The
service sector also grew 2%, after a negative year in 1990.
   Industry was stagnant in 1991, following negative growth
of 8% the previous year. Since 1980, industrial output has
increased a mere 3.2%.
   The bureau didn't disclose the value of Brazil's gross
national product, the sum of good and services; newspapers
estimated it at about $360 billion.
   GNP, based on 1980 as 100, was 118.93 last year, the
bureau said. It was the same level as in 1988, and four
points lower than the high in 1989.
   "We cannot say economic recovery has begun, but this
growth, despite a tight monetary policy, is certainly
important," said Claudio Considera, head of the bureau's
National Accounts department.
   However, all sectors of the economy showed a downturn in
the last quarter of 1991. The drop reflected tighter
restrictions on the money supply aimed at reducing
25%-a-month inflation.
