Judge Freezes Assets
   Of Principals in Case
   Involving Bus Shelters
In a lawsuit filed earlier this week, the SEC charged the
company and the Newport Beach, Calif., couple with illegally
raising as much as $48 million through the sale to as many as
4,800 investors of bus stop shelters, mostly in Orange
County, Calif. The SEC accused the defendants of fraud and
sale of unregistered securities.
   Metro Display sold the shelters to investors for $10,000
each, the SEC said. Then the company agreed to lease the
shelters back from investors, at a monthly rent of $170, net
of maintenance expenses. But advertising revenue from the
shelters wasn't sufficient to cover lease payments to the
investors, the SEC said.
   Many investors never received a bus stop shelter for their
$10,000 investment, the SEC said. The number of investors far
exceeds the number of shelters installed by the company,
clearly establishing that numerous investors have been the
victims of "a massive fraud," the SEC said.
   Thomas J. Nolan, a Los Angeles attorney representing the
LeRoyers, said they "vigorously deny the allegations that
this was an intentional fraud on the investing public."
