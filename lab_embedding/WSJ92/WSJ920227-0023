Keating Says He's Unable
   To Fund Defense for Trial
"The final result is that Mr. Keating will be unable to
conduct any defense" in the trial, said the attorney, Stephen
C. Neal, a partner in Kirkland  Ellis, based in Chicago. The
trial is set to begin March 9 in federal court here.
   Defendants in civil suits typically represent themselves
if they can't afford a lawyer because the law doesn't provide
for a right to counsel. In a brief interview yesterday, Mr.
Neal declined to comment on Mr. Keating's plans. The attorney
said he continues to represent Mr. Keating, former chairman
of American Continental, in his appeal of a conviction on
securities-fraud charges in state court in Los Angeles last
December.
   "It has been some months since {National Union} paid any
of our bills," Mr. Neal said. Kirkland  Ellis sued the
insurance company this year in New York state court "for
breach of certain agreements to pay us," Mr. Neal said.
   National Union, based in New York, reportedly has spent
more than $30 million in legal costs and settlements on
behalf of American Continental, the former parent of Lincoln
Savings  Loan Association.
