   Five-Year Car Leases
   Defeat Original Purpose
Five-year leasing is as outdated as the Edsel. Leasing was
designed to help people avoid the depreciation and thus
reduce the buying cycle back to 24 and 36 months. By doing
this, people can avoid the losses and pay only for the
portion they use.
   The Toyota dealer took an avenue made to benefit both the
customer and the dealer and took advantage of it. He should
re-evaluate his statements of who took whom to the cleaners
and look at himself and his method of selling.
