Business Brief -- Campbell Soup Co.:
   Member of Dorrance Family
   To Sell One Million Shares
Mr. McMillin estimates that Mrs. Weber owned 4.8%, or
about 12 million, of Campbell's approximately 250 million
shares outstanding at the time she announced her intention to
sell. In total, the Dorrance family controls about 56.8% of
the company. "It seems likely that the dissidents will be
sellers of the stock over the next few years," Mr. McMillin
says.
