Arizona Lawmaker to Seek
   Ban on BankAmerica Plan
"I'm opposed to the merger," Mr. Pena said. "Small
commercial businesses are not able to secure loans at a
reasonable rate right now. If we have another merger and one
bigger bank, money will be even less available for smaller
enterprises and rural counties." Mr. Pena, who is chairman of
the state senate's commerce and labor committee, said the
committee is likely to pass the bill tomorrow.
   A BankAmerica spokesman said the bill is "unnecessary. It
addresses antitrust issues we have been working on for months
with federal and state authorities."
   Meanwhile, the proposed deal faces other opposition. Amid
intensive lobbying on the Washington state bill, BankAmerica
last week said it would consider selling Security Pacific's
large bank unit in the state if that measure becomes law. The
bill hasn't yet made it to the floor of the state's House of
Representatives.
