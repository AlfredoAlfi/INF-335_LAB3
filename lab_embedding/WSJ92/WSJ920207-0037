International Brief -- Oy Nokia:
   Finnish Concern Carries Out
   Reshuffling of Shareholders
Nokia immediately used part of that former KOP holding, a
4% voting stake, to finance the acquisition of Finlux OY, a
Finnish manufacturer of television sets. The Finlux purchase,
which includes the assumption by Nokia of an undisclosed
amount of debt, has an estimated value of 205 million
markkaa. Final terms will be disclosed when the transaction
closes next month, Nokia said.
   Nokia also launched a long-awaited overhaul of its ailing
consumer electronics division yesterday.
