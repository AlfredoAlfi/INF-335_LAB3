   Low Cost of Success
   At Community College
In most states, for less than $1,000 a year, college
students can obtain a two-year degree that will permit them
to transfer to a four-year college. This strategy allows the
middle-income family to avoid low-equity loans, government
loans and other types of loans. It also introduces the
student to an educational climate in which special attention
is paid to students and to instruction.
   Studies have shown that students who transfer with a
two-year degree are often more successful than most students
who begin their education on a four-year campus. Therefore,
it is not only a way to save money, but it is also a method
for ensuring the success of the students.
