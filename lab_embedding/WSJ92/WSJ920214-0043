SP 400 Futures Contract
   Starts With a Big Demand
Institutional participation is considered vital for the
prospects of any new financial futures contract. Lack of such
participation has doomed other launches, including the Merc's
attempt last year at contracts pitting foreign currencies
against one another.
   The SP Midcap 400 index tracks 400 companies with a
median market capitalization of about $754 million and total
market value of about $425 billion.
   Institutions place orders for the new futures contracts --
and for SP Midcap 400 options contracts traded at the
American Stock Exchange -- mainly to hedge against adverse
price swings in their holdings of these midsized companies'
shares. An estimated $2 billion in investments is linked to
the index.
