Who's News:
   Boesenberg Resigns
   Post at Mips Computer
Mr. Boesenberg will serve as president and chief operating
officer at Central Point, which had sales in 1991 of $75
million and is preparing to go public soon, according to
people familiar with the company. Prior to joining Mips, Mr.
Boesenberg was senior vice president of U.S. marketing for
Apple Computer Inc.
   The job switch comes after a money-losing year for Mips,
although the company reported a fourth-quarter profit. "It
hasn't been a lot of fun to be at Mips since the middle of
last year," said Robert Herwick, an analyst with Hambrecht 
Quist. "And Bob Miller may have left (Mr. Boesenberg) less
space than he wanted."
