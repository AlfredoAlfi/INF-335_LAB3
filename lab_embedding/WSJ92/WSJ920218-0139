Letters to the Editor:
   Seeks True Dangers,
   Not Hyped Scares
Dr. Whelan has indeed opposed misrepresentation of
scientific fact by advocacy groups -- her organization, for
example, was the pioneer in exposing the fraudulence of the
Alar scare. ACOSH is that all too rare phenomenon -- a
genuine consumer health organization, seeking to separate the
true dangers from the false hyped scares, and to help the
average citizen balance risks and benefits.
