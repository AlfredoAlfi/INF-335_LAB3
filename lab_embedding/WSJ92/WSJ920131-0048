Business Brief -- UJB Financial Corp.:
   Investors Seek to Control
   Board, Then Sell Company
"In this period of increasing consolidation of banks and
other financial institutions," the group said, "a sale or
merger of UJB in exchange for cash or securities is the best
way to enhance shareholder value."
   In October, Chilmark President Neil J. Weisman urged the
bank to consider merging or consolidating with another bank,
leading banking circles in New Jersey and Philadelphia to
speculate that a merger might be likely. A Chilmark spokesman
said there had been "no substantive response" to the earlier
request.
   Officials at UJB Financial, which has about $13 billion in
assets, couldn't be reached to comment.
