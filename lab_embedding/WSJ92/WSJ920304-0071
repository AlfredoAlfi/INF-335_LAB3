Comex Runoff Election Set
The candidates beat out two others in yesterday's
election, but neither received a majority of votes of full
exchange members.
   It is the first time a woman has been a candidate for the
position, and if Ms. Redel wins it is believed she would be
the first woman to head a U.S. futures exchange.
