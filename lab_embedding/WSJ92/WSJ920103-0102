Qatar Revamps Rates System
The QMA created a new base lending rate which will act as
the peg for riyal borrowing and lending. The base rate,
currently 5%, will be adjusted in line with U.S. interest
rates, the QMA said.
   Banks will be allowed to charge as much as three
percentage points above the base rate for loans, giving a
ceiling of 8% for local lending. Previously, Qatar had a
fixed interest rate structure, with the lending rate set at 9
1/2%.
   The Qatari riyal is already pegged to the U.S. currency at
a rate of 3.75 riyals to the dollar.
