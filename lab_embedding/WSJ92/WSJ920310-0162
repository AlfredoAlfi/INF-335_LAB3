   Smith Rejoins Rexene
   As Chief Executive
Mr. Smith resigned as president, chief executive officer
and director in January 1991, and the company said at the
time that his contract was expiring and he wanted to make a
change. For the past year, Mr. Smith was president and chief
operating officer of a Dallas environmental and
waste-management concern.
   Arthur L. Goeschel, 70, was named chairman of Rexene, a
maker of petrochemicals products, last week after Mr. Gilliam
resigned. Rexene is operating under bankruptcy-law protection
while it works on a plan to repay its debts.
