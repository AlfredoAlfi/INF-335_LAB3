Business Brief:
   Two Trump Casinos
   Plan `Prepackaged'
   Bankruptcy Filings
On Friday, the deadline for bondholder approval of the
plans, the two plans had been ratified by more than 50% of
the bondholders holding more than two-thirds of the face
value of each casino, the minimums needed, the spokesman
said. Holdouts will now have to accept the plans.
   Under the Trump Plaza restructuring, holders of $250
million in debt will swap their 12 7/8% first-mortgage bonds
for $225 million in new 12% first-mortgage bonds and $75
million of 9.35% cumulative preferred stock. Mr. Trump will
retain 100% equity in the property. Current bondholders will
receive paper with a face value of $50 million more than
their current bonds. There will be no principal payments on
the bonds for 10 years.
   The Castle deal calls for Mr. Trump to cede 50% equity in
the property to bondholders, who will exchange about $287
million of 13 3/4% bonds for 9 1/2% bonds of the same face
value.
   Mr. Trump's third Atlantic City property, the Trump Taj
Mahal, restructured its debt last year through a similar
deal.
