Business Brief -- MarCor Resorts Inc.:
   Concern Cuts Debt by Sales
   To Firm Chairman Controls
The sale included a 125-acre parcel and MarCor's 65%
interest in a 40-acre parcel in Henderson, Nev., as well as a
five-acre warehouse site and 9.6 acres of raw land here. The
company also sold its 65% interest in a local retail center.
   Mr. Marnell said the sale reduces MarCor's debt to about
$57 million from $82.3 million at Sept. 30. The agreement
also allows MarCor, under certain conditions, to benefit from
the eventual sale of the assets when the real estate market
improves.
