Despite Doubts, Economists
   Believe Recovery Is Coming
But the research department of the Philadelphia Fed, which
conducts the quarterly survey, noted: "Doubts about the
recovery are much stronger than indicated in the past two
surveys." The forecasts see a 4-in-10 chance that the economy
will shrink in the current quarter and a better than 2-in-10
chance that it will shrink next quarter.
   Even if the recovery arrives, the forecasters don't expect
a resurgence of inflation, predicting the consumer price
index will rise 3.3% this year. They expect short-term
interest rates to rise slightly in the second half of the
year as the economy rebounds.
   Over the next decade, the economists expect the U.S.
economy to grow at a 2.5% annual rate. They predict consumer
prices will rise by 3.7% annually, down from a 4% estimate
made just three months ago.
   The economists also expect that stocks will provide a 10%
return over the next 10 years, while the yield on 10-year
Treasury bonds averages 7.5%.
