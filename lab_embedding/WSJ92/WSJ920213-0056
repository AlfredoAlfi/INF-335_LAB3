   Earnings in Fourth Quarter
   Jumped at Holding Concern
Loews, a holding company with interests in insurance,
energy, hotels, broadcasting, shipping, tobacco and Bulova
watches, said the year benefited from a $104.8 million
pre-tax gain on the sale of some oil tankers. Realized
investment gains for the full year totaled $203.1 million, or
$2.95 a share, compared with investment gains of $17.2
million, or 24 cents a share, for the prior year.
   The company posted smaller quarterly losses in its hotels
and shipping businesses and slight profits in its watches

quarter, against the $39.5 million loss taken in 1990. The
drilling business reported a widened loss and the profitable
cigarette operations were down 13% on $96.1 million paid in
excise taxes.
