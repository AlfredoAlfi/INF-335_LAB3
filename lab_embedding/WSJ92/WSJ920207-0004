Ryland Group's Net
   Fell 56% in 4th Period;
   Special Charge Cited
Ryland said its homebuilding business remained weak in the
fourth quarter but said a tripling of profitability in
financial services more than offset those problems. The
company added that orders for new homes increased 23% in the
quarter and that contracts outstanding at year end were 34%
higher than a year earlier.
   The company said the improvement continued into January,
when new-home orders, at 983, more than doubled the
yearearlier number. The cancellation rate in January was 14%,
down sharply from a 27% rate in the fourth quarter.
   The company said its homebuilding operations will continue
to face problems in the first quarter but said the business
is expected to improve during the year.
   For all of 1991, net dropped 57% to $9.5 million, or 53
cents a share, from $21.8 million, or $1.53 a share, the year
before. Without the special charge in 1991, earnings would
still have dropped 17%. Revenue declined 7% to $1.21 billion
from $1.31 billion.
   Yesterday, Ryland's shares closed at $27.125, off 25
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
