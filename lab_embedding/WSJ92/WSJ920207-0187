Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 48.2% involved
stock-index arbitrage, up from 44.9% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 47.2% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 39.2%
involved trading for customers. An additional 13.6% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were Nomura Securities and UBS Securities.
