Owens-Illinois Inc.'s
   Purchase of Brockway
   Is Approved by FTC
In a decision written by FTC Chairwoman Janet Steiger, the
commission said the merger wasn't likely to reduce
competition "or tend to create a monopoly in any line of
commerce."
   John Lemieux, chairman of Owens-Illinois, said the
decision will allow the company to "focus fully on our
objective of world-wide technical and product leadership in
glass and plastic packaging as well as the other market
segments in which we compete."
   Owens-Illinois, based in Toledo, Ohio, went public last
year. Previously, it had been a unit of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts  Co., the New York leveraged buy-out specialists.
   In December, a federal jury found that Owens-Illinois and
Brockway had fixed prices on glass containers in the 1970s
and 1980s. The judge in the case ordered a new trial but the
case, brought by bottlers and other users of containers, was
settled before the second trial began. The terms weren't
disclosed.
   Owens-Illinois's attempt to acquire Brockway began in
1987. The FTC attempted to block the merger in federal court,
but lost. It then initiated the proceedings that resulted in
the administrative law judge's ruling and the FTC's final
decision announced yesterday.
