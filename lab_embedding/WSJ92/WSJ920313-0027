Marketing  Media:
   Business Week Sues
   A Man for Alleged
   Subscriptions Fraud
In late 1991, Business Week alleges, subscribers received
harassing phone calls from Pinnacle Subscription Services,
one of Mr. Huddleston's companies, about subscription
renewal. Other subscribers got "dunning" invoices for
renewals that they hadn't ordered and received legitimate
invoices from Business Week after they had paid Pinnacle for
bogus renewals.
   Mr. Huddleston didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
   The Business Week complaint is the second lawsuit from a
major publisher against a subscription service company. Last
month, Time Warner Inc.'s magazine division filed suit in
California against a magazine subscription agent, alleging it
sold unauthorized renewals to Time magazine subscribers after
fraudulently obtaining the names from Time.
   Business Week said it would also file a motion for a
restraining order to bar the defendants from soliciting
Business Week subscribers while the lawsuit is pending.
