Business Brief -- PSA Peugeot Citroen S.A.:
   Chairman Gives Estimate
   Of Sharply Lower Profit
The 1991 first-half profit of 2.27 billion francs was down
54% from 4.95 billion francs in the same period of 1990.
   Separately, Peugeot said it expects to spend between 80
million francs and 100 million francs on repairing
engineering design faults in its 605 top-of-the-line model
that was launched in 1989. The 25 design and manufacturing
defects range from faulty electrical connectors to
unsatisfactory body sealing and carburetors that make engine
starts difficult when hot. About 140,000 Peugeot 605s have
been sold in Europe, half in France.
