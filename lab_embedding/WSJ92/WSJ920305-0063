International:
   Gorbachev `Autobiography'
   Will Be Put on Celluloid
"We're terming it an autobiography, because it will be
very much Gorbachev's view," said Mr. Cairns. In addition to
considerable footage of Mr. Gorbachev, the directors hope to
include interviews with world leaders who dealt with him,
such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.
