Lockheed Puts Building
   For `Skunk Works' on Hold
About 3,000 people currently work at the Burbank site,
where the F-117A Stealth fighter was developed and where such
other secret programs as the U-2 and SR-71 spy planes were
born over the unit's 47 years of operation. Lockheed has said
it plans to move all but about 350 of its Skunk Works
personnel from Burbank by 1994. Sherm Mullin, president of
Lockheed Advanced Development, said he expects the unit's
total employment to remain stable at about 4,600 through
1992.
   Work on the new headquarters, a project announced last
November, had been set to start this year.
