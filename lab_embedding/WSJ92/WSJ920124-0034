Business Brief -- Mattel Inc.:
   Company Agrees to Acquire
   Big Maker of Card Games
International Games is best known for producing Uno, a
perennial top-selling game in terms of unit volume.
International Games sells its card and board games in 25
countries internationally, and Mattel said it hopes to
capitalize on the popularity of those games overseas.
   Last year, Mattel lured marketing whiz Lawrence I.
Bernstein away from competitor Hasbro Inc.'s Parker Brothers
unit and charged him with building Mattel into a presence in
the game business. Mattel has a games subsidiary in Europe
that posted sales of about $20 million last year, and will be
introducing some new games at a toy industry trade show next
month.
   Mattel has bought or licensed several properties in recent
months to help build up its product lines to include activity
toys and other categories.
