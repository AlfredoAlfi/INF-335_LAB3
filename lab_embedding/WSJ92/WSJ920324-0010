Marketing  Media:
   Columbia Pictures
   Appoints Sid Ganis
   Head of Marketing
The changes come as Columbia's marketing group has come in
for some criticism in the wake of the studio's last two
disappointing films "Gladiator" and "Radio Flyer."
   Mr. Ganis, 51 years old, had been executive vice president
at Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Sony Corp. unit which
serves as the umbrella company for both the Columbia and
TriStar movie studios.
   Industry executives said that with this move Mr. Ganis
effectively is returning to the type of studio marketing job
for which he was most highly regarded. From 1986 through
1990, Mr. Ganis worked at Paramount Communications' Paramount
Pictures Corp. in such roles as president of the motion
picture group and president of world-wide marketing. Prior to
joining Paramount, Mr. Ganis had been senior vice president
of Lucasfilm Ltd.
   "This gives me the opportunity to dive into the movie
business headfirst again," Mr. Ganis said. "That's something
that's in my bloodstream and I love it."
