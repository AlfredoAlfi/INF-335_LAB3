Letters to the Editor:
   Just Keep Looking
   Over Your Shoulder
I have read Richard Hofstadter, and your editorial page is
no Richard Hofstadter. The first half of his book was
entitled "Studies in the American Right," and devotes
considerable attention to virulent anti-communism as a key
symptom of the paranoid style. I am sure your dead enemies
are pleased by their posthumous ideological reconciliation
with your editorial page.
