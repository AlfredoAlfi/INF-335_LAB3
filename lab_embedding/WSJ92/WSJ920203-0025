   Rose to $103.29 Billion
   In 1991, a 63% Surge

They said weakening domestic demand and lower oil prices
-- the main factors that sharply pushed down Japanese imports
in 1991 -- will continue to expand Japan's surplus in 1992.
   "The trade balance will widen slightly more," said Noboru
Kawai, economist with Morgan Stanley Group in Tokyo. "More
and more Japanese companies are relying on exports to reduce
the extent of production cuts," as Japan's economic expansion
has slowed and inventories have surged, he said.
   Although the surplus won't surge as sharply this year, Mr.
Kawai said it could set a new record of $120 billion in 1992.
Matthew Berlow, economist with Credit Lyonnais Securities,
said the surplus is likely to edge up to $108 billion for the
year.
   Japan's economy is expected to grow 3.7% in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1992, down from a growth rate of 5.5%
the year before. For the fiscal year starting April 1, the
government expects growth to decline further to 3.5%.
   Japanese exports in 1991 rose 9.4% to a record $306.6
billion. But imports dropped 6.2% to $203.31 billion.
   The Finance Ministry cited several "special factors,"
including falling oil prices, the yen's appreciation and a
drop in gold imports, for the sharp increase in Japan's
surplus.
