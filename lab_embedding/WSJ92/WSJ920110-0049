Business Brief -- Safeway Inc.:
   Concern Says Special Charge
   In Quarter Was $71 Million
The charge is expected to have a "material impact" on its
1991 earnings, the company said, but won't significantly
affect its cash flow or financial position. Analysts have
estimated Safeway's 1991 profit at $1.41 to $1.55 a share. In
1990, the company earned $87.1 million, or 91 cents a share,
on revenue of $14.9 billion.
   Several years ago, Safeway sold its Houston division to
AppleTree Markets Inc., which filed this month for protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Safeway had assigned a significant number of leases to
AppleTree, remaining liable for rental payments the assignee
has been unable to make.
