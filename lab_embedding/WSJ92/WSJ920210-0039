Japan Ministry May Lower
   Car-Export Ceiling for U.S.
In recent days, the local press has been filled with
reports speculating that next fiscal year's ceiling will be
lowered in an attempt to diffuse protectionist sentiment in
Washington. Until Monday, officials had denied those reports.
   But although MITI officials now acknowledge they're
"looking into" proposals to lower the ceiling, they're still
tight-lipped about the number of vehicles by which they might
do so.
   If MITI persuades Japan's makers to accept more
restrictive export limits, it would be for the first time
since the annual ceiling was adopted in 1981.
   The car makers agreed on an annual export limit of 2.3
million vehicles for the fiscal year ending March 31. That
level is higher than the original 1981 ceiling, which was
1.86 million vehicles.
   Japan's passenger-car exports to the U.S. in the year
ended March 31, 1991, were 1.84 million vehicles, slightly
below the level allowed by the voluntary restraints.
