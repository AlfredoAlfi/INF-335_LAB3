International Brief -- Grande Holdings Ltd.:
   Company Increases Its Stake
   In Sansui Electric to 51%
The price is the same tiny amount as in a deal made in
December in which the Hong Kong business group acquired 32%,
or 50 million shares, of the financially troubled Japanese
electronics concern.
   Grande will send executives to join the management of
Sansui Electric, which posted a 22.2% decline in sales last
year to 20.5 billion yen ($155.3 million) because of sluggish
sales of audio equipment and videocassette recorders in the
U.S. and Europe. In January, Sansui said it would report a
pretax loss of 10.6 billion yen for 1991.
   Polly Peck still owns a 21% stake in Sansui, which is
being restructured.
