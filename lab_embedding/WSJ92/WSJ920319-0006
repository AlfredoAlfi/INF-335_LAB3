Cooper Industries Inc.
   Sees Modest Growth
   For 1992 Profit, Sales
Cooper earned $393.2 million, or $3.01 a share on a
fully-diluted basis, in 1991, on sales of $6.16 billion.
   The company produces compressors and other products for
the oil and gas industry, electrical products, hand tools and
automotive parts.
   Mr. Cross said after an analysts meeting here that the
depressed U.S. natural gas industry will prevent a rise in
sales and earnings for Cooper's petroleum and industrial
equipment segment. He said increased oil and gas industry
sales abroad should balance weaker results in the U.S.,
producing approximately flat operating profit for the group.
   The other four Cooper product groups -- electrical
products, electrical power equipment, tools and hardware, and
automotive products -- all should show some increase in sales
and operating profit this year, he said.
   If housing starts are significantly stronger this year, as
some economists project, Cooper's tools, hardware and
electrical products will benefit, Mr. Cross said.
