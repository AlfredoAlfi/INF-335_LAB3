In testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee's
communications panel, Mr. Sikes also said that cable systems
should be allowed to carry phone calls. He said he supported
the goals of a Senate bill aimed at speeding up construction
of fiber-optic phone networks, but he expressed reservations
about certain provisions.
   The bill would allow phone companies to program up to 25%
of the capacity of fiber-optic networks, but Mr. Sikes didn't
endorse a specific level. Limits on phone company
programming, as well as a requirement that phone companies
run their TV business out of separate subsidiaries, would
preclude the possibility of anticompetitive behavior, he
testified. Both restrictions, he suggested, could expire in
10 years once robust competition developed.
   The bill, which is sponsored by Sens. Conrad Burns (R.,
Mont.) and Albert Gore (D., Tenn.), isn't considered likely
to pass this year, but the debate is likely to intensify next
year as phone companies push to enter the cable business.
