Business Brief -- NESB Corp.:
   Banking Concern Has Profit
   In 4th Quarter Due to Gain
Much of the turnaround was a result of November's
restructuring of $50 million in 9.8% senior notes. The
restructuring included conversion of the notes into
convertible preferred stock and forgiveness of repayment on a
portion of the notes. The agreement increased NESB's total
equity by about $28.5 million.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robin Honiss said he
expected activity in the bank's residential real estate
markets to be better in 1992 than in 1991, particularly in
view of currently low residential mortgage rates. He added
the company was pleased that the level of nonperforming loans
has declined in each quarter since the third quarter of 1990.
Total assets at Dec. 31 were $1.17 billion, down from $1.24
billion in 1990.
