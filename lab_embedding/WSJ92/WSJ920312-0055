Former Thrift Official
   Gets Prison Sentence
   For Taking Kickbacks
Judge Barry said the harsh sentence was justified because
Mr. Spagnoli's "greed" and "arrogance" contributed to City
Federal's insolvency and the savings and loans crisis.
   Gregory J. Wallance, a white-collar crime defense attorney
with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays  Handler, said the
sentence is "atypical" but "permissible" under the
guidelines, which allow judges to consider aggravating or
mitigating circumstances not contemplated by the Federal
Sentencing Commission when it drafted the guidelines.
   The guidelines force judges to hand down sentences within
a range provided on a mathematical grid, taking into account
such variables as the amount of money swindled in a fraud,
whether weapons were used in a violent crime and the amount
of drugs seized in a raid. Appeals courts have generally
frowned on departures from the guidelines, which apply to
crimes committed after Nov. 1, 1987.
   Mr. Chertoff said the ruling is a "textbook-correct
interpretation of the law" that he believes "will stand up on
appeal.
   Justin Walder, Mr. Spagnoli's attorney, did not return
several phone calls.
