U.S. Racial Rifts Widen
   Among Youth, Study Finds
"Our young people have placed themselves in opposing
camps, divided by race, and they tend to believe only the
worst about youth of other races," said Arthur J. Kropp,
president of People for the American Way, which sponsored the
study.
   Entitled Democracy's Next Generation, the study was
conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. Its findings
are based on interviews with 1,170 people contacted through a
nationwide telephone survey, discussions with two all-white
focus groups in Raleigh, N.C., and in-depth interviews with
78 young white and minority Americans.
   A majority of those asked said improving education is the
best solution to today's problems and that widespread
integration is the key to resolving tensions among young
people. However, while 69% of young Hispanics and 61% of
young blacks said they would "feel pretty comfortable" dating
interracially, only 34% of young whites said they would.
