International Brief -- GPA Group PLC:
   Third-Quarter Net Income
   Rose 33% to $73.1 Million
For the nine months, operating profit fell 7.9% to $236.4
million from $256.7 million in the year-earlier period.
Revenue edged down to $1.46 billion from $1.49 billion,
largely reflecting GPA's weak first half.
   Tony Ryan, GPA's executive chairman, said the increase in
operating profit and net income in the third quarter "shows
that we are recovering from the impact on air travel of the
Gulf conflict."
