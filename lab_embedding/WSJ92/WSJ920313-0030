   Unveil Digital TV System
The widespread expectation is that the FCC will select one
of four systems that offer TV in digital form -- that is,
converted into numbers like text in a word-processor or music
on a compact disk. But digital TV poses enormous technical
hurdles, including compressing and transmitting the vast
amount of information in each frame of a video.
   Yesterday's demonstration, at ATT's Bell Laboratories,
showed that digital TV has the potential to offer video with
the fine-grained realism of a photograph. The demonstration
included footage of a Chicago Bulls basketball game shot with
an HDTV camera.
   The other three digital contenders include two by General
Instrument Corp. (one of which it jointly designed with the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and one by an
international team including Thomson S.A. and Philips
Electronics N.V.
