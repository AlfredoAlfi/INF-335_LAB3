Brady Says Bush Won't Cut
   Gains Tax Unilaterally
"There is a thought around Washington that capital gains
could be indexed by regulation," Mr. Brady said. "We haven't
found any scholars inside the government, or out, that will
agree to this." He urged Congress to pass a law cutting
capital-gains tax rates.
   Although officials have been making this point for weeks
-- usually behind the cloak of "senior administration
officials" -- advocates of such a move have been pressing
their case. Mr. Brady's comment yesterday was the strongest
public statement on the issue to come from the
administration.
