Business Brief -- Circle K Corp.:
   Store Chain's Reorganization
   Plan to Be Unsealed Today
Last December, the company, based in Phoenix, said it
proposed to its creditors a business plan that included the
sale or closure of 40% of its 3,776 stores and withdrawal
from 14 of the 32 states in which it was operating. It was
unclear how many jobs would be eliminated under that plan.
