Letters to the Editor:
   Business as Usual
   Creates Social Woes
My point is that many -- probably most -- of our "social
problems" (disease, crime, poverty, pollution, etc.) arise
directly from the legal activities of profit-seeking business
enterprises. Until our legislators change the rules of the
business game in such a way as to reduce its destructiveness,
after-the-fact alleviation by nonprofits will not be enough.
   Human societies have always insisted on regulating
business activity, to one degree or another, in order to
protect or advance the public interest. In these times of
enormous industrial power to create and destroy, we must do
more regulating than ever before and do it better. Even so,
there will still be plenty of damage for a galaxy of
nonprofits to clean up if they can.
