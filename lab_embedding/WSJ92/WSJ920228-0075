ATT Agrees to Buy
   French Data Concern
   For About $88 Million
Pierre Benhamou, chairman and chief executive officer of
Dataid, who owns 61% of the company's shares, has agreed to
support the offer, ATT said.
   Dataid, which provides services such as managing computer
centers and designing software for various industrial,
financial and institutional applications, had 1991 revenue of
about $125 million. It primarily serves the French market but
also has offices in Belgium and Luxembourg.
   After the acquisition, Dataid will continue to be run by
its French management and staff and will be supported by ATT
Istel, a wholly owned subsidiary. ATT entered the data
services business in Europe in 1989 with its purchase of
Istel Ltd., one of Britain's leading providers of data and
other information services over computercontrolled phone
lines. At the time, analysts said ATT's move would stimulate
competition in the European information-services industry.
