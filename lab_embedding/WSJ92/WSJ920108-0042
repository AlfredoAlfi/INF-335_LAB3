MCI Adds Incentives
   For Callers Who Cease
   Using Rivals' Cards
Calling-card customers of MCI can set up a conference call
by dialing an "800" number and by paying $2.50 for each
number connected to the conference. The MCI Messenger service
will deliver a card member's message for $1.60 per message.
   MCI's new service aims to lure away additional customers
of American Telephone  Telegraph Co. and rival US Sprint
Communications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.
A sales promotion begun by MCI last summer to sign up the
friends and families of its customers in return for 20%
calling discounts has lured several million customers away
from ATT, according to analysts. ATT disputed this, saying
its market share has remained stable and that its card
services are competitive. Sprint noted that it was first to
offer conference calling to card customers and that it will
bring out additional card services in coming months.
