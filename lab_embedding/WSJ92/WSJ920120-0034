Business Brief -- Amgen Inc.:
   Company Seeking to Void
   Japanese Concern's Patents
Amgen's version of the drug, called Neupogen, has garnered
big sales since its approval for sale in the U.S. last
February. Amgen said it has two patents covering the drug and
the process for making it.
   Chugai, which has approval to sell its version of the drug
in Japan, hasn't yet sought approval in the U.S., an Amgen
spokeswoman said. She declined to discuss Amgen's reasons for
bringing the legal action at this time.
   Officials of Chugai, which is based in Tokyo, couldn't be
reached for comment.
