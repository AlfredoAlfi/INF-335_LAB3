Pact to Sell Business Ended
Shearson confirmed the plans. But it declined to identify
the potential buyer of the home-equity portion, saying only
it was a "financial institution."
   The home-equity loan portfolio, with $600 million in
loans, represents more than half of the mortgage unit's
assets. Upon completion of the sale, the remaining unit would
concentrate on originating and servicing first mortgages,
Shearson said.
   Shearson had reached a tentative agreement last December
with the group, which included Middle Eastern investors. The
termination of the tentative agreement to sell the entire
home-mortgage business represents a minor setback for
American Express, which is looking to raise capital to
strengthen its core businesses.
