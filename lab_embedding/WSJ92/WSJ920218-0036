International Brief -- Ing. C. Olivetti  C. S.p.A:
   Labor Agreement Will Cut
   Firm's Work Force by 1,500
Olivetti said last week that it expects to post a
consolidated 1991 loss of at least 290 billion lire ($237.8
million), though the figure could be higher if extraordinary
charges linked to the restructuring plan are included.
   The 1,500 workers will receive unemployment benefits,
which are stipulated by law and paid for by the government
and the company involved, until other jobs can be found for
them.
   The government has made a commitment to employ 1,000 of
the 1,500 workers that leave Olivetti. The other 500, of
which 320 workers will be from Northern Italy and 180 from
the depressed Mezzogiorno region in the south, will be
offered early retirement incentives or alternative job offers
in an attempt to phase them out.
