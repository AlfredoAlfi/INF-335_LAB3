The ratings agency said the last two years' rate of 3%
annual growth in gross domestic product are likely to be
followed by two years of approximately 1% growth.
Unemployment was 16.8% in January, and the economy remains
weak.
   SP said use of one-time revenues from a tax amnesty
program raises concern over the commonwealth's ability to
achieve long-term financial stability. Puerto Rico is
particularly vulnerable to further downturns in the economy,
SP said, noting it maintains a negative rating outlook on
the bond issues.
