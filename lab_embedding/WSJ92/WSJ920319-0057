Senate Fails to Override
   Veto of China Trade Bill
The 60-38 vote reflects a continuing standoff between
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) and other
Democrats who favor a tough stance on China and a mostly
Republican minority that agrees with Mr. Bush's cautious
handling of the Asian giant. Yesterday's majority included
the votes of Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of
Nebraska, both of whom were out campaigning for the
Democratic presidential nomination when the Senate approved
the China bill on Feb. 25. However, Sen. Mitchell's camp
still fell six votes short of a two-thirds majority needed to
override a veto.
   The defeat of the Senate motion nullified the House's
357-61 vote to overturn the veto last week. Congress has yet
to override a veto by President Bush.
