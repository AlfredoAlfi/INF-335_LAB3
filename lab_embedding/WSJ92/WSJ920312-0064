American Express
   Admits Its Problems
   In Core Card Business
"For years we have been able to remain above the fray of
credit card competition," said the letter, which was signed
by Chairman James D. Robinson III and President Harvey Golub.
"But bankcard issuers have turned their sights on our primary
markets -- the affluent households and
travel-and-entertainment spenders," the letter continued. It
acknowledged merchant dissatisfaction with fees that are
higher than those of competitors.
   In addressing that issue, the company confirmed previous
reports that it is "selectively adjusting" fees it charges
merchants for purchases made by cardholders. The letter also
noted that the company would cancel contracts with merchants
who discourage use of the card.
   "We want to ensure the card is welcomed -- not just
accepted. . .," said the letter, which was enclosed in
American Express's 1991 annual report.
   John Keefe, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services
Inc., said that while the company "may have waited too long
to pay attention to its problems," the letter was "very
encouraging. It's a very realistic view of the environment,
and the steps that they are taking is something they needed
for some time," he said.
