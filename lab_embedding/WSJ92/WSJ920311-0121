Continental Airlines Plans
   To Add 71 Daily Flights
The carrier, a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
said it has already begun hiring several hundred employees to
support the new schedule. Airport agents and multilingual
flight attendants are being recruited and trained.
   Continental's Houston hub will add 31 daily flights,
including new international service to Quito, Ecuador, and
Chihuahua and Leon, Mexico. Continental will add one flight
daily to its four-flight schedule between Houston and Mexico
City. The Houston-Monterrey, Mexico, route will be flown four
times daily compared with two. The airline also will increase
the number of flights to its existing domestic destinations
and begin nonstop service to Sacramento and San Jose, Calif.
   From Newark, N.J., Continental will add flights on its
domestic routes and flights to London, Paris, Frankfurt,
Madrid and Bermuda. The airline plans to add an extra daily
flight on 10 domestic routes from Denver.
   Continental said it will resume the seasonal nonstop
service from its Cleveland hub to Seattle/Tacoma and on to
Portland, Ore. More flights are being added to the Miami and
Tampa service as well.
