Business Brief -- Perkin Elmer Corp.:
   Savings From Restructuring
   Benefit Earnings Estimates
The year-end earnings will benefit "substantially" from
restructuring savings finally kicking in, Mr. Kelley said.
The company, which is based in New York, is also benefitting
from its biotechnology alliance with Hoffman-La Roche  Co.
Mr. Kelley also noted a 35% growth rate in sales to the Far
East, which now constitutes 10% of Perkin Elmer's total
revenue. He said the company is eager to expand in the
biotechnology instrumentation field, possibly through
acquisitions.
   Mr. Kelley also maintained an upbeat outlook on domestic
revenue. "We've seen small hints of a turnaround," he said.
"While it's not in the double-digits, a corner has been
turned."
