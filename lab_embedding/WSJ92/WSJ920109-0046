Japan to Study Supporting
   U.S. Supercollider Project
"That seems to be a small step in the right direction,"
said Larry Neal, spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, a Texas
Republican strongly committed to the collider.
   Japanese participation is viewed as crucial, since
Congress has linked its support for the project to financial
backing from other countries. So far, only India has pledged
any money, and its commitment is a mere $50 million. The
Energy Department has promised to line up $1.7 billion in
foreign contributions. Washington is said to have asked Tokyo
for about $1.5 billion.
   An Energy Department spokesman declined to comment.
   The supercollider will hurl beams of protons at one
another in a 54-mile tunnel to produce high-energy
collisions.
