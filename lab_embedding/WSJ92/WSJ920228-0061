House Panel Clears
   Additional $25 Billion
   For Thrift Bailout
The bill also removes an April 1 spending deadline for a
previous $25 billion that the Congress committed last fall.
As drafted, the legislation requires President Bush to
request the latest $25 billion for the Resolution Trust
Corp., the SL cleanup agency.
   The subcommittee draft was a compromise between members
who wanted to give the bailout agency unlimited funding in
order not to have to vote on the unpopular program again, and
members who want to keep the agency on a short leash. Most
members were convinced that taxpayers, as Nevada Republican
Rep. Doug Bereuter put it, "want Congress to be involved,
supervising this activity."
   Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.) argued vehemently that the
committee should consider amendments to allow some weak
thrifts to continue operating with government assistance,
rather than costlier government-funded liquidations. "I think
it's very outrageous for our committee not to put in these
other amendments that could save millions of dollars," he
said.
   The full committee and the Senate are expected to take up
the bill soon.
