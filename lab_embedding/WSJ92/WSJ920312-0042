Republican Plan Calls
   For Broad Disclosure
   Of Check Abusers
The proposal, which could come to a vote as early as
tomorrow, responds to increasing pleas from both Republicans
and Democrats for a complete airing of the records available
from the facility.
   The GOP plan, which is still subject to scrutiny by the
House Republican Conference today, would supplant a
resolution supported by the House Democratic leadership that
calls for less direct disclosure.
   The Republican plan -- like the Democrat's plan -- would
label 24 former and current House members as "abusers," a
moniker that could prove fatal to many of their political
careers. But unlike the Democratic plan, the Republican
proposal would also itemize the accounts of the most flagrant
66 check overdrafters, in effect creating a second tier. The
remainder would have fewer details of their transactions
disclosed.
   The names and check-overdraft histories of the lawmakers
would come soon after the vote, under either plan. Under
both, the 24 "abusers" would be named 10 days after the vote
this week. Under the Republican plan, all other information
would be released in 20 days.
