Baseball's Giants Agree
   To Move to San Jose Park
According to the agreement, the city will pay $155 million
of the estimated $185 million cost to build the ballpark. The
Giants, owned principally by real estate investor Bob Lurie,
expect to sign a 30-year lease and to pay the balance of the
construction costs as well as all of the park's operating
costs. San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer said in a statement the
deal is "competitive with others in contemporary major league
baseball and is good for San Jose." She said getting the
Giants could bring $90 million in economic benefits to San
Jose.
   The Giants had been looking for a new stadium since the
early 1980s primarily because of logistical complaints about
its present home, Candlestick Park, a frequently cold and
windy place. In 1989, San Francisco voters rejected a
proposal for a new downtown stadium.
   San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan is still rooting for his
city. "If I have the opportunity to negotiate a future deal
with the Giants," Mr. Jordan said, "I'll do my very best to
keep the team in San Francisco."
