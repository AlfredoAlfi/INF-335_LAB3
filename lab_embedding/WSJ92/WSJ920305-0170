U.S. Auto Sales
   Declined 11.5%
   In Late February

   Drop From Earlier in Year
   Damps Industry Hope
   That a Rebound Is Near

Overall sales of domestic cars and trucks combined fell
11.5% from the weak period of a year ago, to 288,396
vehicles. For all of February, total vehicle sales, including
imports, rose 2.3% from last year, when the Persian Gulf War
kept consumers out of showrooms.
   Despite the publicity given to "buy American" sentiment,
Japanese auto makers have raised their share of U.S. car
sales to 30% so far this year from 28% in the first two
months of last year. But overall, the latest sales appear to
indicate that a lack of consumer confidence continues to
plague the economy.
   "This is sort of a setback," said Joseph Phillipi, auto
analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton. Based on the results for
the first 20 days of February, "we thought sales had ramped
up to a new level. It's worrisome that the auto makers can't
sustain it."
   Thomas Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile
Dealers Association, voiced a similar sentiment. "Right now,
the only strength lies in domestic trucks and certain
Japanese-badged cars," he said. "I expect sales will remain
in a holding pattern until the recently reported signs of an
improving economy are translated into real jobs and real
paychecks."
   Some dealers say they're starting to see more shoppers,
though not yet many more buyers. "It's not the kind of thing
that sets off rockets and bells, but we are seeing a
turnaround," said Jack Roger Williams, owner of a multiline
auto dealership in Dallas. "The biggest problem is consumer
confidence. People are concerned whether to turn loose the
money."
   Overall, General Motors Corp. fared better in late
February, and for the entire month, than its domestic rivals,
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. GM's total sales of cars
and trucks fell 9.6% for the last 10 days of the month,
compared with yearearlier figures. But that's a smaller
decline than the 14.5% drop at Ford or the 13% drop at
Chrysler.
   For the entire month, GM's share of car sales alone --
excluding trucks, minivans and off-road vehicles -- jumped to
36.4% from 35% in February of 1991.
   GM benefited from surging sales of some redesigned 1992
models. Sales of its Pontiac Bonneville rose 48.5% from a
year ago, and sales of the Cadillac Seville more than
doubled.
   Ford's share of car sales dipped to 21.5% in February from
22.1% a year earlier; Chrysler's fell to 7.9% from 9.3% a
year earlier.
   Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. handily beat
Chrysler in car-market share. Toyota grabbed 9.7% of the U.S.
car market, up from 8% in February 1991. Honda's share rose
to 8.8% from 7.7% a year earlier. Nissan Motor Co.'s market
share edged higher last month, but the shares of other
Japanese auto makers dropped.
   Sales of European cars climbed in February-albeit from
extremely weak yearearlier levels. Domestic sales by
Mercedes-Benz AG, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, rose 14.1%;
Jaguar PLC sales climbed 8.5%; and Porsche AG sales surged
22.2%. But last year's sales were distorted because car
buyers tried to beat the new luxury tax that took effect
January 1991 by buying in December 1990.
   "The luxury auto industry is just as weak as the rest of
the market," said Susan Jacobs, an auto-market analyst based
in Little Falls, N.J. "The pressure isn't off the Europeans
by any stretch of the imagination."
