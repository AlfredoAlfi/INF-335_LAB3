Barbara Franklin Wins
   Senate Confirmation
   For Commerce Post
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, declared his support for the 51-year-old
businesswoman but also wound up echoing Sen. Rockefeller's
concern about the Bush administration's trade policies.
   Ms. Franklin is stepping into a job vacated by Robert
Mosbacher, who has become general chairman of President
Bush's re-election committee. She faces several major tasks,
including pressing Japan to live up to its promises to open
its market further to foreign products. She also will seek to
strengthen the Commerce Department's export-promotion role
and must fill key vacancies in a bureau responsible for
keeping sensitive U.S. technology away from untrustworthy
users.
