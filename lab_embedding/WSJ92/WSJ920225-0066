Business Brief -- United Bank of Kuwait:
   Yearly Pretax Profit Rose
   82% on Lower Interest Costs
Operating profit nearly doubled to #16.1 million from #8.7
million, although loanloss provisions also advanced to #6.0
million from #3.2 million in 1990.
   The bank, which was hit in 1990 by charges required in the
wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, boosted its net income in
the latest year by writing back a portion of its #13.5
million in charges.
   UBK tied its lower interest costs, which declined to
#142.1 million from #215.2 million, to reduced activity in
the interbank and wholesale money markets.
