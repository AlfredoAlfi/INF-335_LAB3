Canada's GDP Increased
   Only by 0.1% in October
The November figure was further indication that the
economy is experiencing what Statistics Canada has called the
weakest recovery from a recession since World War II.
   The economy pulled out of a recession with a burst of
growth last spring. But since then, the economy has shown
little momentum, even though short-term interest rates have
declined about seven percentage points since May 1990.
   Separately, Statistics Canada reported that the value of
building permits issued during November rose 10.1% from
October.
