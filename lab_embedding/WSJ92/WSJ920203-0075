Benetton Posts Rise
   Of 12% in '91 Revenue
Separately, a Benetton spokeswoman couldn't confirm a
press report that the clothes maker's Japanese partner, Seibu
Department Store, a unit of Japanese conglomerate Saison, is
buying a 2% stake in its share capital. The speculation arose
after a substantial package of Benetton shares was reportedly
sold in an off-bourse transaction earlier last week.
   "Our shareholder profile is unchanged. However, the
{Benetton} share has been very heavily traded recently, and
this makes us happy," the spokeswoman said. "But these
transactions take place in the normal course of making
investments and we don't have any information about the
identity of the buyer."
