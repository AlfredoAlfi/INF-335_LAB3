Japan's Steel Output
   Edged Lower in 1991
   As Demand Shrank

The federation also reported that Japan's steel production
in December fell 13.8% from a year earlier, the fifth
consecutive month of year-on-year decline. December
production was down 1.9% from November.
   A federation spokesman said that the current drop in steel
production reflects reduced demand from Japan's manufacturing
sectors, notably the construction and automobile industries.
   The spokesman said the decline in production volume in
1991 was the first drop since 1986, when a steep rise in the
yen's value made it harder for Japanese steelmakers to sell
overseas. In 1986, Japan's steel output slipped 6.7% to
98.275 million metric tons.
   He said that steel output in 1991 remained high, marking
the sixth-highest volume ever recorded. But he pointed out
that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has
predicted that Japan's steel output for the first quarter
will come in at 24.5 million metric tons, down 12.5% from a
year earlier.
