Tejas Gas Unit's Lending Pact
The agreement requires quarterly principal payments over a
seven-year period starting next year and a final payment in
1999. No principal payments are required this year. The
facility was provided by a group of banks including the
co-agents, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce.
