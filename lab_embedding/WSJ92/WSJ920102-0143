Pepper...and Salt
Many things expand in the heat
   And contract in the cold, we know;
   But my driveway is different:
   It widens as I shovel snow.

   Frigid fingers
   And frozen nose,
   Frost-tipped ears
   And icy toes.
   About running
   I Have learned a lot:
   The winter's too cold,
   The summer's too hot.
