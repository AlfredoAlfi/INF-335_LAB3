Business Brief -- Rodman  Renshaw Capital:
   Firm Posts Record Revenue
   For Month on Market Rally
For the six months ended Dec. 31, the Chicago securities
firm had net income of $968,000, or 22 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $455,000, or 11 cents a share, for
the year-earlier period.
   Mr. Mains said long-term prospects depend on a continuing
strategy of increasing revenue in each of Rodman's five
primary lines of business while holding costs constant. He
said Rodman is positioning itself to remain profitable even
if market strength diminishes, particularly in the
fixed-income area.
   Rodman closed its New York retail operation in the spring
and realigned its investment-banking division.
