International Brief -- DSM N.V.:
   Dutch Group Posts Decline
   Of 40% in 1991 Net Income
Results included extraordinary gains of 20 million
guilders related to DSM's sale of its interests in the
clothing maker Macintosh, the car maker Volvo, DSM Agro
Specialties and DSM's powder coating activities. These gains
were partially offset by the cost of the company's current
reorganization program. A year earlier, DSM had extraordinary
gains of 47 million guilders.
   Despite the fall in profit, DSM said that it would
maintain its dividend at the 1990 level of eight guilders a
share.
   Sales for the year fell 8% to 9.35 billion guilders from
10.16 billion guilders.
   DSM said it doesn't expect a sudden turnaround in its
earnings prospects.
