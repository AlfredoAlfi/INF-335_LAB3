Business Brief -- Gleason Corp.:
   Tool Maker to Take Charge
   For Layoffs, Cleanup Costs
Gleason said it is working with the Environmental
Protection Agency to clean up waste at the Rochester site,
but declined to say what type of waste it is.
   Because of a lower backlog of orders, the company expects
"somewhat lower" 1992 sales. But because of cost-cutting and
faster delivery times, Gleason said it expects "improved"
operating earnings. Operating net should be lower in the
first half of 1992, but higher in the second half, the
company said. Spokesman Dan Gutt said the company expects the
economy to improve in the second half, but that benefits from
an improved economy wouldn't show up in the company's
earnings until 1993.
