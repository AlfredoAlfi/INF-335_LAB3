Discrimination Rise Cited
   Against Asian-Americans
Many of the problems cited in the report stem partly from
the language barriers many Asian-American immigrants face.
For example, the report said that Asian-Americans often
receive inadequate police protection because local police
forces do not provide interpreters.
   Other barriers, however, may result entirely from
discrimination, according to the report. For example,
professional certification boards in many states have
different requirements for foreign-educated professionals
than for U.S.-educated professionals, which many
Asian-American immigrants believe is "a pretext for
discrimination on the basis of national origin," the report
said.
   In addition, the report said the Civil Rights Commission
has received allegations that Asian-Americans are "virtually
shut out of construction unions in New York City."
   The commission is an independent fact-finding agency
created under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The commission
doesn't have any enforcement powers.
