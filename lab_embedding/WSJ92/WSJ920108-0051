Credit Card Delinquencies
   Rose Slightly in October
Meanwhile, charge-offs, or losses from debt that are
unrecoverable, rose 25% to 5.8% of outstanding credit card
balances. However, Moody's said the rate of charge-offs have
"steadied" since March 1991, with the rate fluctuating
between 5.4% and 6%.
   "With sluggish growth, we expect charge-offs to remain
near their current levels," said Andrew Silvers, a Moody's
economist. He said even with an improvement in the economy,
"we don't expect charge-off rates to fall to pre-1990 levels"
when they hovered around 3.9%.
