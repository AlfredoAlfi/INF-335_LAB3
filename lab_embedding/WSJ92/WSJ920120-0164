Business Brief -- Cyclops Industries Inc.:
   Division Will Be Closed;
   Special Charge Is Slated
Cyclops decided to close the plant, which employs about
250 people, "after repeated unsuccessful attempts to improve
profitability, including the negotiation of a new labor
agreement," the company said.
   Cyclops is expected to be acquired by specialty steelmaker
Armco Inc, Parsippany, N.J., in February. The United
Steelworkers of America, whose members work at Bridgeville,
asked the chief executives of Cyclops and Armco for a meeting
to discuss the companies' plans, the union said.
