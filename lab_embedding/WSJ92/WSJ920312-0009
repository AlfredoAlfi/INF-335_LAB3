Business Brief:
   Leaseway Is Offering
   Restructuring Plan
   To Avoid Chapter 11
The proposal would also give "virtually all" of the
company's common stock to holders of its 13.25% subordinated
debt, if they abandon their claim for $192.5 million of
principal plus accrued interest. The largest known holder of
the bonds is New York investor Carl Icahn, who last year
pressed Leaseway to pay the debt. Mr. Icahn wasn't available
for comment. Citicorp's venture capital business owns between
40% and 48% of Leaseway's equity.
   Leaseway, which was taken private in a 1987 leveraged
buy-out, hasn't been able to pay its bank debt and it
suspended interest payment on its bonds in February 1990. The
proposal would leave Leaseway with about $35 million in cash,
which it said should provide sufficient liquidity.
   However, because the proposal deals only with Leaseway's
two largest creditor groups, a final agreement could still
involve a previously planned Chapter 11 filing or a return to
public ownership. The company declined to comment on these
possibilities.
