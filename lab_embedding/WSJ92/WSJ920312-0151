Grolsch Posts 10% Rise in '91 Net
Sales in 1991 soared to 791.5 million guilders from 472.5
million guilders. The jump in Grolsch's sales stemmed from
the acquisition of the German brewer Wickuler Group.
   Grolsch said that in the first half of 1991, beer sales
were "disappointing" due to the Persian Gulf War, which
slashed tourism and reduced carnival celebrations in the
Netherlands. Following close on the heels of these
developments were two months of exceptionally poor weather in
May and June.
