Business Brief -- CommerceBancorp:
   Firm Expects to Post Loss
   Totaling $2.9 Million for '91
CommerceBancorp said the increase in loan-loss reserves is
"general and not related to any particular loan." The
"protracted recession and weak real estate market" played
roles in the decision to bolster reserves, the company said.
   For 1990, CommerceBancorp posted net income of $3.6
million, or $1.65 a share.
   CommerceBancorp said it continues to maintain a strong
capital base despite the projected loss. The company said it
exceeds all minimum regulatory guidelines and ratios.
