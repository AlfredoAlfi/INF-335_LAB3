International:
   Saudi Arabia, Japan
   Agree on Expansion
   Of Oil-Refinery Project
Under the original plan, three Japanese companies --
Nippon Oil Co., Nippon Mining Co. and Arabian Oil Co. -- had
been studying with the Saudis since last year the possibility
of building one 150,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Japan and a
300,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Saudi Arabia. The size of
the Saudi refinery will be left unchanged from the original
plan.
   The companies said they haven't decided how the three
refineries will be accommodated in the project, which will be
50%-owned by Saudi Arabia. The other 50% will be owned by the
three companies plus Caltex Petroleum Corp. of the U.S.,
which owns a 50% stake in Nippon Petroleum Refining Co., a
refining arm of Nippon Oil.
   The project will enable Japan, which is almost entirely
dependent on imported oil, to strengthen ties with the
world's largest oil exporter while giving Saudi Arabia access
to the lucrative Japanese oil product market, oil industry
officials and analysts have said.
