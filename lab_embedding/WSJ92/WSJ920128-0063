Business Brief -- Consolidated Freightways Inc.:
   Wider Fourth-Quarter Loss
   Posted; Revenue Fell 7.5%
The company said the bright spot was the company's Emery
air freight operation, which trimmed its fourth-quarter
operating loss to $7.3 million, a $22.3 million improvement
from the previous quarter. But Donald Moffitt, president and
chief executive officer, said business conditions remain
weak, putting profit margins under pressure, especially in
trucking operations.
