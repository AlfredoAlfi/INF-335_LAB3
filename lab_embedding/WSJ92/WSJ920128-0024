Business Brief -- Varian Associates Inc.:
   Fiscal First-Quarter Profit
   Fell 39% Due to Recession
Lower volume and operating problems in certain of its
businesses combined to reduce profitability, despite
cost-cutting moves, even below the company's "modest"
expectations for fiscal 1992, warned Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer J. Tracy O'Rourke. He didn't elaborate on
the company's profit outlook, but added there must be a
reasonable degree of market recovery for Varian to match or
exceed fiscal 1991 performance.
