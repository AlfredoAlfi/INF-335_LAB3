International Brief -- Svensk Stal AB:
   Sweden to Sell Steelmaker
   Under Its Privatization Plan
Sweden's Industry Minister Per Westerberg estimated that
sale of the government's remaining 60% voting stake would
fetch between 1.5 billion Swedish kronor ($251.1 million) and
two billion kronor. Price and other details of the offering
won't be disclosed pending publication of an offering
prospectus next month, he said.
   The offering will be in the form of government bonds,
carrying warrants to subscribe Svensk Stal shares over a
period of two years. On the Stockholm Stock Exchange
yesterday, Svensk Stal's Series B free stock climbed three
kronor to 145 kronor in moderate trading.
