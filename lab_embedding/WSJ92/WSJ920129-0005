Business Brief:
   Cyanamid Plans Cut
   In Toxic Emissions
   Of More Than 75%
Cyanamid and other chemical companies have been under
mounting pressure from environmental and area citizens groups
to halt or sharply curtail deep well injection of toxic
chemicals at many of their Gulf Coast and Mississippi River
sites. While the companies maintain that the process is safe,
critics claim that the wells often aren't adequately
monitored and that no one can be sure what will happen to the
toxics once they are injected deep underground.
   Cyanamid also plans to annually recover about 12 million
pounds of acetonitrile, used to make drugs and herbicides,
and more than one million pounds a year of hydrogen cyanide,
a highly poisonous byproduct from the production of material
used in acrylic fibers. The company also said it plans to
sharply reduce the discharge of nontoxic effluent and waste
water into the wells.
   After these reductions, the plant will still pump about 30
million pounds a year of sulphuric acid into 3000-feet deep
wells, said spokesman Jim Dutcher.
   In 1990, Cyanamid emitted 172.5 million pounds of toxic
chemicals that are monitored by the Environmental Protection
Agency and cataloged in its Toxics Release Inventory.
