Business Brief -- McDonald's Corp.:
   Restaurant Chain Cooks Up
   In-House Family Magazine
McDonald's didn't return phone calls yesterday, and Quad
Publishing officials declined to comment about the magazine.
   Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham
 Co., said McDonald's apparently is "trying to build up good
will with the customers" by giving them "another reason to
visit" the restaurants.
   "Anything that will help them strengthen their position
with kids and young families would be healthy," said Michael
G. Mueller of Montgomery Securities. The family-oriented
magazine might increase customers' perception of McDonald's
"as a good place to take your kids to eat."
   The company will distribute two issues of the free
magazine in certain restaurants this fall. If the magazine is
successful, the company plans to take it nationally and
increase the publishing frequency.
   The move follows several previous unsuccessful attempts by
McDonald's to launch an in-house publication. McMagazine,
targeted at mothers and children, will carry advertisements
from noncompeting companies.
