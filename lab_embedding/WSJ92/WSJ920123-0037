Congressional Budget Chief
   Sees Recovery in 2nd Half
"First," he said, "high vacancy rates for office buildings
and rental housing continued to cast a pall over new
construction. . . . Second, an unusually large share of the
spurt in demand that occurred in the late spring in summer
was satisfied by imports rather than domestic production."
Third, declines in personal income and publicized layoff
announcements "shook consumer confidence."
   But don't worry. Mr. Reischauer anticipates that recent
declines in interest rates will produce a recovery, "albeit
mild and delayed," in the second half. The CBO now forecasts
that the economy will grow 2.8% in 1992, slightly below the
office's earlier 3.3% forecast. It estimates that the economy
shrank at an annual rate of 0.6% in the fourth quarter, and
didn't grow at all between the fourth quarters of 1990 and
1991.
   The CBO projects the federal deficit will hit a record
$352 billion this fiscal year, even without any tax cuts. And
it anticipates a $327 billion deficit in fiscal 1993, which
begins Oct. 1. The fiscal 1991 deficit was $269 billion.
