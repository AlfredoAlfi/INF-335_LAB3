Business Brief -- Value Merchants Inc.:
   Retailer Sees Sharp Gains
   In Results for Current Year
For the coming year, Mr. Appel said he is "very
comfortable" with analysts' estimates of earnings of $2 a
share. He believes sales "will exceed" $400 million.
   In the year that begins Feb. 2, the company plans to open
200 Everything's $1 stores, 25 Toy Liquidators stores and 48
temporary toy stores for the eight-week Christmas season.
   "We are in the right segment of retailing," Mr. Appel
asserted. "We think that the closeout segment of retailing is
going to have a lasting impact well beyond this recession."
