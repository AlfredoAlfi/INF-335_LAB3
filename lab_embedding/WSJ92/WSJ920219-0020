   Pacific Bell Announces
   Three Information Services
Along with the news reports, which will be available
through the company's voice mail service, Pacific Bell plans
to offer an expanded directory assistance service.
   The service essentially fills in the blanks for callers
who don't know a company's full name. In addition, the phone
company could provide a company's hours of operation and
address complete with nine-digit ZIP code and the cross
streets near the address. The company, however, will need
state regulatory approval before it can offer the service.
   Pacific Bell also said it is developing a computerized
information service that will give California schools access
to the Internet, a National Science Foundation network, and
to information that could help teachers.
   The company already offers a "Homework Hotline," a
voice-mail service designed to aid communication between
schools and parents.
