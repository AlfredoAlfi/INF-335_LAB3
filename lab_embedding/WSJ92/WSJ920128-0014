   Hearst, Izvestia to Publish
   Paper in English, Russian
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
To be called We, the newspaper is the brainchild of John
Wallach, foreign editor of Hearst Newspaper Group, and has
been two years in the making. A sample edition printed in
July 1990 sold out all 135,000 copies in less than a day in
Moscow, Kiev and St. Petersburg, Mr. Wallach said.
   Full production was delayed by the August coup attempt and
last year's turbulent political and economic reforms, which
resulted in the collapse of the Soviet Union.
   The newspaper will focus heavily on business issues
relating to the transition to a market economy, but will also
have analysis and entertainment news, said Jerry Schecter,
who shares with Mr. Wallach the title of founding editor.
   Mr. Golembiovsky said the newspaper expects to "break
even" during the first year but doesn't expect to start
making a profit for five years. Any profits will be divided
equally between Hearst and Izvestia, he said.
