Business Brief:
   Glenfed May Post Loss This Quarter
   And Find It Hard to Meet Capital Levels
The potential loss, coupled with required write-offs of
good will, would make it more difficult for Glenfed to stay
above current minimum capital levels, let alone meet higher
requirements in the future. Based on one measure of financial
strength, Glenfed's capital is 2.31% of assets. Regulators
can impose painful operating restrictions if that figure
falls below 2%, and they intend to raise the floor to as much
as 4% or more.
   In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Glenfed said it is unlikely to meet that future minimum
unless it can raise outside capital.
   Because of an accounting change, Glenfed also restated
earnings so far this fiscal year. The company said it earned
$27.6 million, or 81 cents a share, in the fiscal second
quarter ended Dec. 31, instead of a previously reported $20.5
million, or 60 cents a share. For the fiscal first half, it
earned $51.6 million, or $1.51 a share, instead of $37.6
million, or $1.10 a share. The tax-related change added $13
million in capital to the balance sheet. Glenfed has been
bolstering earnings by severely slashing operating expenses
and staff, and by selling loans.
