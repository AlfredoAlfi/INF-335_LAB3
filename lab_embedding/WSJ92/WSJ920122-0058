   HBO  Co. Announces
   Departures of Two
   Of Its Top Executives
HealthQuest, which provides software products primarily to
large hospitals, "is positioned so well right now," said Mr.
Murrie, "it's time I can do something else."
   Also leaving the company is Thomas Muller, HBO's chief
financial officer. Mr. Muller, 50, also said that he and HBO
had mutually agreed on his departure. "We're pursuing
different paths," he said.
   A spokeswoman said both departures are part of continuing
efforts by Charles McCall, HBO's president and chief
executive officer, to streamline the company and its
controls.
   HBO named Joe Blesser, currently the company's controller,
to succeed Mr. Muller. No successor was named for Mr. Murrie.
The spokeswoman said that HealthQuest's management team will
report directly to Mr. McCall.
