International:
   Mongolia Opens Exchange
   As Part of Privatization
Under the privatization program, vouchers worth 10,000
tugriks ($250) were distributed to the country's 2.1 million
people. The vouchers can be used to buy shares in the 340
large and midsized state firms to be floated on the market,
or to bid for ownership of almost 3,000 small state
enterprises.
   During the 75-minute opening session, vouchers valued at
3.16 million tugriks were exchanged for shares in one large
firm and two medium-sized companies.
   Stock exchange Chairman Zolzhargao said 90 companies have
had privatization plans approved. He plans to introduce about
five companies to the market a week. He said the market
initially will have a single, four-hour session each Tuesday,
with plans to expand trading to five days a week by June.
   Foreigners will be able to buy shares after the opening of
a secondary market that will sell stock for money, rather
than vouchers. Foreigners will be restricted to owning 49% of
any company. Mr. Zolzhargao said it's unlikely the secondary
market will open before the middle of the year.
