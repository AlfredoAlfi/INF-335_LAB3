Toshiba Lowers
   Earnings Forecast
   For Fiscal Year
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Toshiba predicts unconsolidated sales will total 3.2
trillion yen, slightly lower than the 3.32 trillion yen it
predicted earlier.
   The company cited "the world-wide recession in the
semiconductor, computer and other information and
communication systems equipment markets" in its downward
revision.
   The company also said that the lower earnings expected for
the current year will drag down its spending on plants and
equipment as well as research and development in the next
fiscal year. Toshiba had planned to spend 250 billion yen
this fiscal year on capital improvements and research and
development on an unconsolidated basis, for the parent
company alone. Its spending in the next fiscal year will
probably be "70% to 80%" below that level, a company
spokesman said.
   For the year ended March 30, 1991, Toshiba reported
unconsolidated pretax profit of 175 billion yen, net of 94
billion yen and sales of 3.228 trillion yen. On a
consolidated basis, the company reported pretax profit of 259
billion yen, net of 121 billion yen and sales of 4.695
trillion yen.
