James P. Hanbury, a brokerage-industry analyst at Wertheim
Schroder  Co., said that PaineWebber "is the only broker I
follow that had higher earnings in each successive quarter
last year. Most guys bounce around a little bit."
   For the full year, PaineWebber had record net of $150.7
million, or $3.15 a share, compared with a $57.4 million
year-earlier loss. Revenue rose 6% to $3.17 billion.
   PaineWebber's assets under control jumped 26% from a year
ago to $93.2 billion. "The assets keep coming in, at a rate
of almost $1 billion a month," said Donald B. Marron,
PaineWebber chairman and chief executive officer, in an
interview. "The whole industry is benefiting" from the influx
of customers' cash because of the steady fees earned from
managing the assets.
   Although PaineWebber isn't known as a major investment
bank, its banking revenue nearly doubled in the quarter to
$98.3 million, amid the boom in initial public stock
offerings. Mr. Marron said the market for IPOs, including
those for biotechnology companies, should remain strong.
"There are still some biotech IPOs we can bring out," he
said. He noted that buyers have become "very selective," but
that's "healthy."
