   Data Suggest That Autos

   Japanese Make Gains

The January results were noteworthy in another way too:
They provided that the "Buy American" campaigns around the
nation are producing more publicity than results.
Japanese-nameplate cars, including those produced both in the
U.S. and overseas, accounted for 30% of car sales in the
month, up from 27% in January 1991.
   The Japanese gains came at the expense of Chrysler and GM,
both of which sustained market-share declines compared with a
year earlier. Ford's car market share rose.
   Domestic cars sold at a 6.1 million seasonally adjusted
annual rate in the Jan. 21-31 period. While remaining solidly
in the recessionary zone, the results were up slightly from
the six-million-vehicle rate for the 30-day period ended Jan.
20. The latest rate is also higher than the depressed 5.3
million-car sales pace of a year earlier, when Americans were
transfixed by the Gulf War.
   Overall, U.S. auto makers sold 236,524 cars in late
January, up 8.3% from a year ago. Sales of vans, light trucks
and off-road vehicles rose 17.5% to 126,109 vehicles from
last year.
   The latest results marked just the third sales period in
three months in which the annual sales pace topped six
million cars. The increase was enough to lift auto stock
prices. In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, General Motors Corp. common shares were quoted at
$35, up $1; Ford Motor Co.'s common at $33.375, up 62.5
cents; and Chrysler Corp.'s stock at $16.375, up $1.375.
   Many dealers noticed an increase in customer traffic in
the latest 10-day period, even though much of the traffic
didn't translate into sales. "Our customer traffic is finally
picking up," said Doug Watanabe, sales manager of Burien
Honda in Seattle.
   Tobin Braun, general sales manager of Rinke Toyota in
Warren, Mich., said sales at the dealership are off slightly
compared with a year ago, but are starting to improve. "Sales
have been steady recently," said Mr. Braun. "People are
starting to look again."
   For all of January, total sales of domestic and imported
cars and trucks in the U.S. rose 3.5% to 851,939 from 823,306
a year ago.
   Among the Big Three auto makers, GM posted the strongest
gains in late January, even though it didn't do well for the
entire month.
   The auto maker's late-January car sales rose 14.1% to
93,785 vehicles, and truck sales climbed 25.8% to 41,519
vehicles. But for the entire month, GM's combined car and
truck sales rose only 1% to 295,231 vehicles.
   Sales of the Pontiac Bonneville, Buick LeSabre and
Oldsmobile 88 Royale rose 61% last month, thanks to heavy
customer incentives. However, that wasn't enough to sustain
GM's share of the U.S. car market, which fell to 35.3% in
January from 36.5% a year earlier.
   Ford posted a slight gain in market share in January,
largely because of strong sales of its Grand Marquis, Mercury
Sable and Lincoln Town Car. However, those gains were offset
somewhat by the dismal performance of the Lincoln
Continental, whose sales fell 45.5% in January. Ford's car
sales rose 5.1% in January to 117,886; truck sales,
meanwhile, climbed 11.5% to 85,299 vehicles.
   Chrysler's combined car and truck sales slipped 2.8% to
112,737 vehicles for the month. The auto maker's share of
U.S. car sales alone, excluding Jeeps and minivans, fell 2.7
percentage points to 8.5%. Chrysler badly needs the new
midsize cars that it intends to launch this fall.
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales rose 12.6% for the month. Sales
of the redesigned Camry rose 15% in January, while sales of
the Lexus jumped 44%. The auto maker's share of the U.S. car
market rose 1.3 percentage points to 9.5%.
   Honda Motor Co. also grabbed a bigger share of the U.S.
car market. Led by strong sales of the Accord and Civic
models, Honda increased its market share to 9.7% last month
from 8.2% a year ago. The auto maker's sales rose 20.5% in
January to 54,440 cars.
   Not all Japanese auto makers performed so strongly. Nissan
Motor Corp.'s sales rose a meager 2.5% in January, while
Mazda Motor Corp.'s sales declined 7.5% last month from a
year earlier.
   Several European luxury car makers posted sales gains in
January after sustaining sizable losses during most of 1991.
Mercedes Benz of North America and BMW of North America saw
sales rise 30.9% and 44.2% respectively. Audi of America,
meanwhile, reported a 27.6% sales increase.
   Ailing Porsche AG sold 419 cars in the U.S. last month;
while far from robust, the number was a 73.9% increase from
January 1991. In total, European auto makers held their share
of the U.S. car market at 4% last month.
