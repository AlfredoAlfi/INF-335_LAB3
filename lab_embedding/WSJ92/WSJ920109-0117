   Seizes $10 Million
   In Wymer Assets

The impounded assets hinted at Mr. Wymer's reputedly
lavish life style while he managed some $1.2 billion in
investments for government clients of Institutional Treasury
Management Inc. of Irvine, Calif. Early yesterday morning, a
team of postal inspectors and U.S. marshals arrived at Mr.
Wymer's Newport Beach, Calif., home and found a $140,000
year-old Ferrari and a Mercedes parked in the garage.
   Seven other automobiles -- including classic cars from the
early 1960s -- and three pleasure boats were also targeted
for forfeiture. But they reportedly had been "transferred
recently from their previous places of storage," and couldn't
be located, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Alejandro N.
Mayorkas.
   Warrants were also issued for the seizure of Mr. Wymer's
five personal bank accounts in California, which contain an
undisclosed amount of money.
   "Our twofold purpose is to divest Wymer of what we have
reason to believe are properties he derived from monies he
obtained from a fraudulent scheme, and to potentially return
funds to various victims," Mr. Mayorkas said.
   Federal investigators have said they are still trying to
determine what happened to the $100 million missing from the
books of Institutional Treasury Management and its
predecessor firm, Denman  Co. Paul N. Murphy, an attorney
for Mr. Wymer, said at a bail hearing last month that the
shortfall was caused by "trading losses." Mr. Murphy couldn't
be reached for comment yesterday.
   Another bail hearing for Mr. Wymer, who was jailed three
weeks ago, is scheduled for today.
