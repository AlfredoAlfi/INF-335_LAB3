   Heterosexual Transmission
   Of AIDS Increases Sharply
The study found 7% of the second 100,000 cases were
attributed to heterosexual transmission, a 44% increase from
the first 100,000. While women accounted for 9% of the first
100,000 cases, they accounted for 12% of the second 100,000.
   Homosexual or bisexual men still comprise the greatest
percentage of cases: 61% in the first 100,000, and 55% in the
second 100,000.
   As of Dec. 31, 1991, a total of 206,392 cases of acquired
