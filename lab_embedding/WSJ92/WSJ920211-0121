Enterprise:
   ATT Alters Savings
   On Long Distance
   For Small Companies
Short calls to other cities around the world would be
similarly cheaper, but after about four minutes, the call
actually becomes more expensive. The plan will be offered as
part of ATT's Small Business Option Service, which already
offers savings for domestic calls.
   ATT officials said the pricing plan is particularly
attractive for small companies whose calls are mainly fax
transmissions that can usually be done within the four-minute
savings span. They said heavy international business callers
tend to make about twice as many fax calls as do domestic
businesses.
   But for international calls that are more than $125 a
month, the officials said, business customers are probably
better off with ATT's current PRO WATS overseas service.
Starting with the $125 minimum, users of overseas PRO WATS
can get monthly discounts of 2%, and for monthly bills of
$100,000 or more, a maximum discount of 15%. The $125 minimum
for discounts is lower than the previous minimum, ATT said.
