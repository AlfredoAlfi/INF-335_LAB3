Darman Hints at Limiting
   Long-Term Treasury Bonds
Treasury spokeswomen wouldn't comment, except to repeat
that the department is considering such a move. Previously,
officials have indicated that they expect to announce a
decision at or before the refunding press conference next
Wednesday.
   About 7.5% of all Treasury borrowing in recent years has
been in 30-year bonds, and an equal amount has been in
10-year bonds. Shifting to shorter-term securities, probably
to securities with less than a seven-year maturity, could cut
government borrowing costs and help reduce long-term interest
rates, advocates said.
   Mr. Darman said he believes such a move "to a limited
degree" would lower long-term interest rates.
