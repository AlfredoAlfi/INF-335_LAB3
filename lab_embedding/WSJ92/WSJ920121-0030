Pennsylvania Power
   Says Small Explosion
   Injured Two Workers
The utility said one worker was taken to a hospital and
decontaminated. He was released yesterday after treatment for
first-and second-degree burns to the chest. The second, who
sustained only minor injuries, was taken to a hospital and
released Saturday, the company said.
   Pennsylvania Power said the explosion occurred in a backup
recombiner, which wasn't in service at that time. The
recombiner, located in the basement of the turbine building,
combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water, which is then
used to produce steam.
   A spokesman said there was no physical damage to the
recombiner or surrounding equipment.
   He said the workers were preparing to weld a pipe to the
recombiner. Sparks from a grinding wheel touched off a small
explosion because a pocket of hydrogen apparently collected
at the neck of the pipe. The spokesman said an investigation
of the explosion is continuing.
   The Susquehanna plant, which is 90%owned by Pennsylvania
Power and 10%-owned by Allegheny Electric Cooperative Inc.,
serves almost 1.2 million customers in the north central part
of Pennsylvania.
