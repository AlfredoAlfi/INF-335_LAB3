Business Brief -- Marsh  McLennan Cos.:
   Pact Is Reached to Acquire
   Remainder of French Broker
Marsh, based in New York, said the combination will give
it an integrated insurance brokerage organization in the
European community. "We have felt strongly that it isn't
enough just to have affiliates in each of the countries in
which we do business," said Frank J. Tasco, chairman. "Having
common shareholders and being a full participant in the Marsh
 McLennan world-wide organization provide significant and
distinct advantages for our clients."
   Faugere  Jutheau S.A. is the core business for
France-based Faugere  Jutheau Group. The purchase doesn't
include Faugere  Jutheau's remaining insurance brokerage
businesses outside of France.
