Business Brief -- Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.:
   Firm Completes Acquisition
   Of Video Retailer in U.K.
In recent weeks, however, the deal was opposed by two
Cityvision shareholders and former directors, who sent
letters to other holders urging them to ignore Blockbuster's
bid and to elect them to the board.
   Blockbuster said yesterday that, although the offer has a
Feb. 12 deadline, it had received about 81% of Cityvision's
common shares and about 27% of its preference shares.
Blockbuster added that all the conditions relating to the
offers had been satisfied or waived.
