   Canada Endorses Plan
   That Would Extend
   Life of Drug Patents
Under a Canadian patent provision known as compulsory
licensing, generic-drug makers can copy a brand-name drug
after it has been on the market for 10 years. U.S. patent law
provides brandname drugs 17 years of protection.
   In the current round of international trade negotiations
in Geneva, the U.S. and other countries have urged tougher
patent protection for drugs.
   Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson said he was
endorsing the proposals for stronger patent protection for
drugs. The proposals are part of a draft text of a new trade
agreement that is being negotiated under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Canadian government introduced its compulsory
licensing system in 1969 to combat high drug prices. Mr.
Wilson said Canada's federal and provincial health ministers
will meet Jan. 27 "to discuss ways to work together in
ensuring that drug costs remain reasonable" if the proposed
GATT agreement is implemented.
