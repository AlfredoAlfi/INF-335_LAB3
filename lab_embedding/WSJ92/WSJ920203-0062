Business Brief -- Aetna Life  Casualty Co.:
   Special $55 Million Charge
   Tied to Massachusetts Case
The announcement comes two years after Aetna was stymied
in its efforts to leave the automobile market in
Massachusetts by stiff rules governing insurers there. In
April 1990, the insurer filed suit, challenging the rules.
   Aetna said Friday that its Aetna Casualty  Surety Co.
unit would pay $55 million to the state's pool for uninsured
drivers as a settlement of the lawsuit, however. Under the
state's old rules, Aetna would have had to contribute as much
as $200 million to the pool.
   As part of the settlement, the Massachusetts Division of
Insurance and Commonwealth Automobile Reinsurers will amend
its rules governing insurance companies leaving the state.
The change could lead to withdrawals by other insurers.

   THE MASSACHUSETTS uninsured drivers' pool amended its
rules in mid-1991 for insurers leaving the auto insurance
business in the state. Monday's edition misstated the timing
of the amendment.
