First Atlantic Officers
   Indicted on Charges
   Of Taking Kickbacks
The indictment charges both men with using their positions
at First Atlantic in eight separate schemes to extract money
from developers and brokers in return for loans made or
placed by them. In most instances, it charges, kickbacks were
disguised as legal fees and funneled through the attorney
trust account of Cranford, N.J., attorney John J. Lipari. Mr.
Lipari was named as a co-conspirator in the indictment but
wasn't charged.
   The indictment also charged Nelson Miller, 61-year-old
chief executive officer of mortgage broker Cowger  Miller of
Louisville, Ky.; Charles S. Keith, 46, a self-employed mobile
home park developer; and C. Wayne Kinser, 58, president and
chief executive of the Peppertree Resort in Asheville, N.C.
None of the men charged in the indictment could be reached
for comment.
   First Atlantic, South Plainfield, N.J., was taken over by
the Resolution Trust Corp. in February 1990.
