Jefferson-Pilot Corp.
   Rejects Director Slate
   Proposed by Dissident
At the same time, the 20-member board nominated its own
slate of seven individuals to be directors, all of whom, with
one exception, are currently on the board. The company added
that it would "vigorously oppose" Mrs. Parsons's slate.
   Mrs. Parsons, who says she controls about a 2% stake, has
been wrestling with Jefferson-Pilot since last summer. She
has alleged that parts of the company's 1990 proxy statements
were fraudulent and has proposed amending the bylaws to
increase the board's independence.
   For its part, Jefferson-Pilot has denied the allegations
and has emphasized that its performance remains strong.
Indeed, the company yesterday declared a 3-for-2 stock split
and raised the per-share cash dividend 21.4%.
   Mrs. Parsons couldn't be reached yesterday. Her attorney,
Richard Miller of Jones Day Reavis  Pogue in Atlanta, said
Mrs. Parsons was "very disappointed" by the board's decision,
but added that the move "wasn't unexpected." Mr. Miller said:
"She was trying to deal with them in a cooperative way. I'm
surprised we couldn't make more progress."
   He said Mrs. Parsons will decide later this week on her
next move. "Whether she conducts a proxy fight is anybody's
guess," he said.
