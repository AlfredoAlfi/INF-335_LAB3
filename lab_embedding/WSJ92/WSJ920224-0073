Fares at `Hub' Airports
   Are Higher, U.S. Concedes

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
But Mr. Murphy said that while problems persist, airline
deregulation overall "has proven to be a positive force for
the industry and the consumer." He said the industry "remains
intensely competitive" and that average fares and consumer
complaints are at all-time lows.
   Mr. Murphy said Minneapolis, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Pittsburgh, Memphis, Tenn., Salt Lake City, Dayton, Ohio, and
Charlotte, N.C., all have airports dominated by one airline.
Together these airports represent about 10% of the national
market.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of
Congress, reported that fares are about 21% higher when one
or two airlines dominate an airport than when more
competition exists.
   "This should set off an alarm bell as to what might happen
in other markets," said Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.),
who chaired the hearing before the Senate Consumer Affairs
subcommittee. "If we cannot be assured of healthy competition
in the future, then perhaps it's time to take a second look
at {airline} deregulation."
