   Osaka Woman Admits Guilt
   In $1.45 Billion Loan Scam
Ms. Onoue, owner of a popular Osaka restaurant, and three
co-defendants went on trial Thursday. Prosecutors allege Ms.
Onoue borrowed 3.2 trillion yen ($25.93 billion) over 5 1/2
years from various financial institutions to finance
speculation in the stock markets.
   They charge that she conspired with co-defendant Asami
Maekawa, the Imazato branch manager of Toyo Shinkin Bank, to
swindle the financial institutions out of 179 billion yen by
fabricating Toyo Shinkin deposit slips to use as collateral
for loans.
   Among the lenders stung in the case was Industrial Bank of
Japan. IBJ and its affiliates lent about 240 billion yen to
Ms. Onoue, who was also the largest individual shareholder of
the bank. The scandal, which was uncovered last summer,
prompted IBJ's chairman, Kaneo Nakamura, to resign.
   Mr. Maekawa's attorney appealed for leniency for his
client, asserting that Ms. Onoue masterminded the forgery
scheme and that Mr. Maekawa only assisted her.
   The other defendants also pleaded guilty.
