International:
   U.K. Regulator to Review
   Trading in Lloyd's Markets
The first concerns losses by a number of Lloyd's
syndicates specializing in excess-of-loss insurance in 1988
and 1989. In recent weeks, it has been publicly alleged by
some in the market that Lloyd's insiders were skimming off
much of the best business.
   The second area of scrutiny concerns the so-called spiral
reinsurance business, in which syndicates spread their risks
by reinsuring part of them with other syndicates in the
Lloyd's market. Among the allegations made against Lloyd's
has been that reinsurance business was written primarily to
ensure that brokers and underwriters benefited unfairly from
commissions and fees at the expense of members of the
syndicates.
