International:
   Iran Enters Agreement
   With Ukraine to Build
   $7.5 Billion Oil Pipeline
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
As plans to build the pipeline take shape, Iran will
shortly begin supplying oil and gas to Ukraine. This year,
Tehran plans to sell Ukraine four million tons of oil and
three billion cubic meters of natural gas. By 1995, those
sales are to increase to 50 million to 70 million tons of oil
and 75 billion cubic meters of natural gas a year.
   In exchange, Ukraine will supply Iran with metallurgical
and chemical products, including materials and machines.
   According to Ukrainian Prime Minister Vitold Fokin, the
plan is aimed at decreasing Ukraine's dependence on Russian
oil. Ukraine and Russia have been at odds on political,
economic and military issues since the breakup of the Soviet
Union late last year. Ukraine needs 60 million tons of oil a
year but can produce only 8% of that itself.
   Iran and Ukraine plan to sign a contract in Tehran in two
weeks for this year's sale of oil and gas.
