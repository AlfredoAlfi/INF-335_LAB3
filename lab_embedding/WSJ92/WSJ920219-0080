Business Brief -- Memorex Telex N.V.:
   Amsterdam Concern Reaches
   Accord With U.S. Creditors
Confirmation of its plan yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Del., comes six weeks after it filed a
prepackaged plan of reorganization. In such cases, a company
lines up the support of creditors before bringing the plan to
court.
   The company also said that it has been given a new $67.5
million revolving credit line by banks led by J.P. Morgan 
Co.
   Memorex-Telex had announced last July that it planned to
restructure about $1.3 billion in debt by giving over most of
its equity to bondholders.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday assigned an
initial single-B-3 rating to $510 million of new Memorex
senior notes issued as part of the reorganization. While the
rating is below investment grade, Moody's noted that the
notes are structured so that there are no mandatory cash
interest payments on them until February 1994.
