Business Brief -- Alexander's Inc.:
   Trade Obligations Are Met;
   Some Shipments Are Cut
Alexander's operates 11 stores in the New York
metropolitan area.
   The company said it expects to announce a 5% increase in
comparable store sales for the 28 weeks ended Feb. 8, in
spite of very weak November sales. And it said it will have a
pretax operating loss of about $11.2 million for the 28-week
period, compared with a loss of about $12.2 million a year
earlier.
   Alexander's, which is in non-compliance with loan
covenants, said it is continuing to negotiate with lenders,
and is seeking to expand existing bank lines to obtain needed
funds as well as "exploring other alternatives."
