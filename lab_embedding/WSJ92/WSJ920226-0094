Dividend News:
   Merck Declares
   3-for-1 Stock Split,
   Boosts Dividend
The common stock dividend was increased to 69 cents a
share, up from 63 cents, payable April 1 to shares of record
March 6. Late last month, Merck reported a 20% increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, to $529.8 million, or $1.37 a share,
on a 10% sales gain to $2.31 billion. The company had about
386 million average shares outstanding in the fourth quarter.
   Although the announcement was made after the market's 4
p.m. close, Merck shares rose $3 to close at $152.50 in New
York Stock Exchange trading, despite a generally lower
market.
   Merck's shares have surged in recent years, reflecting
market enthusiasm for health care-related equities, the
company's hefty investments in research and development,
continued strong profit trends, and a series of
strong-selling drugs.
   The stock traded as low as $82 in January 1991, but
climbed steadily during the year, and in 1992 has traded as
high as $169.75.
