Business Brief -- Global Marine Inc.:
   Earnings in Fourth Quarter
   Reversed Year-Earlier Loss
Global said 1991 results represented its first full-year
profit since 1983. The favorable results reflect contracts on
larger drilling units for rates higher than current market
levels; those pacts were arranged during the latter part of
1990.
   Given the current downturn in the offshore rig market and
the exceptionally weak domestic gas prices, the company said
it expects 1992 results will be less favorable.
   The company said it has entered into a letter of intent to
sell one of its rigs; that will result in a $12 million gain
for 1992. Global said it would continue to sell selected
equipment as a means to reduce debt and exposure to the
current unfavorable market conditions.
