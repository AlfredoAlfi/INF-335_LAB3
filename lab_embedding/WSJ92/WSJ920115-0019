Technology Brief -- Digital Equipment Corp.:
   Company Plans to Market
   Cray Research Computer
The agreement is the latest in a widening range of
marketing and technology-sharing initiatives between the two
companies, a Digital executive said. Analysts expect the
companies to announce future collaborations, including the
use by Cray of Digital's Alpha microprocessor, which is
scheduled for unveiling next year, in a line of large
parallel-design supercomputers now under development by Cray.
   A Cray executive said the Eagan, Minn., company has
decided on a next-generation chip, but wouldn't disclose
details until next month.
   The model Y-MP EL, unveiled last year, is Cray's smallest
supercomputer. Digital said it will price the machines at
about $350,000 each, and sell them in conjunction with its
VAX product line and high-performance technical computers.
