Business Brief -- Howard Savings Bank:
   Net Loss in Fourth Period

general.
   In the fourth quarter, Howard Savings added $10.1 million
to its allowance for loan and lease losses, compared with a
$20 million addition in the year-earlier quarter. In the
latest quarter, Howard Savings also established a $7 million
reserve for other real estate owned and a $5 million reserve
for a real estate investment in Washington, D.C.

share, a year earlier. Nonrecurring gains for 1991 other than
those in the fourth quarter totaled $8.3 million.
