Letters to the Editor:
   Japanese Perk Up
   Executives' Low Pay
Have you actually probed the Japanese compensation
practices? I know it is sometimes difficult to obtain
accurate data on their management compensation, and that
money is not the only significant form of reward for leaders
in Japanese society.
   Japanese tax policies and customs favor low salaries and
high levels of company-paid benefits, so drawing comparisons
would require a bit of effort. In addition to digging up
reliable data on salaries, bonuses and any stock
acquisitions, a rational comparison would require the
development of some reasonable value for such tax-advantaged
perks as family education, golf-club memberships, homes,
entertainment, gifts, personal staffs and travel that are not
generally provided by a company in this country.
   Perhaps your story has some credence. Perhaps executives
with similar responsibilities in the highly competitive
American corporate culture -- no matter where their employer
is headquartered -- are generously compensated by comparison.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to validate that conclusion
with the limited, unsupported information this story
presented.
