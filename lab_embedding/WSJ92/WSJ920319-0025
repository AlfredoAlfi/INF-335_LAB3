House Panel to Investigate
   Regulation of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds are private partnerships, often limited to
investors with millions of dollars to play with, that use
leverage and rapid-fire market strategies to invest in the
stock, bond and commodities markets. Because they limit their
investor pool to 99 partners, they are exempt from SEC
scrutiny.
   But their size, often with several billion dollars in
assets, and potential for market-moving shifts have brought
them attention. A government report on the Treasury-market
scandal noted that hedge funds "have recently begun to play a
major role in the government securities market," and that
"regulators have little access to information about these
entities." Several hedge funds are under investigation for
their role in the Salomon Brothers Inc. Treasury securities
scandal.
   In his letter, Rep. Markey (D., Mass.) asked the SEC to
assess the risks the funds pose to the markets, whether
agency oversight is adequate, and whether the funds should be
required to increase reporting to the government.
   An SEC spokesman said he hadn't seen the letter and
couldn't comment.
