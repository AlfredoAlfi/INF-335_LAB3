Business Brief -- Tide West Oil Co.:
   Company to Post 22% Rise
   In Revenue for Fiscal Year
Tide West said it purchased additional working interests
in 23 producing wells operated in the Austin Chalk in South
Texas. The purchase, effective Feb. 1, 1992, added
approximately 100,000 barrels of oil to proven producing
reserves. The company also sold its interests in 46
"stripper" wells in Oklahoma which will result in a pretax
gain of $275,000. The wells, which were about 40% of the
company's total wells, produced less than 4% of its oil. The
purchaser agreed to plug and abandon any non-commercial wells
in the sale.
