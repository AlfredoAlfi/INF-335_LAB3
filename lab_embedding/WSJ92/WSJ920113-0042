Business Brief -- Silicon Valley Group Inc.:
   Company Expects to Report
   Fiscal First-Quarter Loss
Mr. Sarkissian said some customers postponed orders
because the recession caused them to delay expansion plans.
Contributing to the loss, he said, was the company's
inability to get shipments out as quickly as it hoped.
   Silicon closed at $7.625, up 25 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading Friday.
