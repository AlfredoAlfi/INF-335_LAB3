Aeroflot Moves to Expand
   Its Cargo Flights to the U.S.
Aeroflot currently runs one weekly cargo flight between
Moscow and New York. A company official said the new venture
would allow the airline to base three cargo jets in Columbus
and run flights more frequently.
   The venture has the potential to give U.S. companies
increased access to growing markets in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union, according to industry consultants.
   While the venture might help Aeroflot broaden its reach,
the carrier may have a tough time competing in the U.S.
market, said Robert Bushman, president of Transportation
Management Group, a consulting firm in Raleigh, N.C. He cited
Aeroflot's older and heavier planes, its dependence on
subsidized fuel costs and its reputation for inefficiency.
   Aeroflot plans to select a domestic cargo carrier as a
partner -- to link international cargo with U.S. delivery --
within three months.
   The airline also signed a letter of intent with
Rickenbacker Development Corp., a Turner Corp. unit, to run
its operations.
