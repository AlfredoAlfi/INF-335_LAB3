   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The other 50% interest was bought by Carl Bro-Fichtner
G.m.b.H., a joint venture of Denmark's Carl Bro Group Ltd.
and Fichtner, a major German engineering firm, CEDC said.
   One of CEDC's projects is a $400 million American Business
Center at Checkpoint Charlie, the onetime Allied crossing
point of the Berlin Wall on Friedrich Strasse. CEDC said the
engineering firm did preliminary design for the project
that's to be finished by 1995.
   The engineering firm's real estate also will be developed
into "premier office space," CEDC said.
