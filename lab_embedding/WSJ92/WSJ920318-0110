Pepper...and Salt
Morticians hold conventions, too,
   And make the normal whoop-de-do;
   They laugh and joke and sing and all,
   And no one there is bearing pall.
   Their glee I've tried hard to assess --
   It's their esprit de corpse, I guess.

   When stocks retreat on a broad front
   My holdings don't suffer such pains:
   They are steadfast during the drop --
   And no different during the gains.
