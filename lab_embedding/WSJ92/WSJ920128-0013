Technology:
   Analog Devices Inc.,
   Hewlett to Develop
   Chip-Making Process
Analog said products based on the new technology initially
will be manufactured at H-P facilities, but Analog will have
the right to obtain a license to manufacture them at its own
facilities. The spokesman added that the new technology will
be developed at a $100 million facility H-P is building in
Palo Alto, Calif., and that Analog will help "cover the
operating costs" of the facility. He declined to disclose how
much of the operating costs Analog will pay.
   Analog said that under the agreement, it will have
immediate access to H-P's "submicron CMOS and BiCMOS
technologies," which are used for low-power chips that have
digital and analog capacities. The CMOS technologies will be
used to develop processes for making chips with "very dense"
arrays of digital and analog components, the spokesman said.
   One of the main applications of such "mixed signal" chips
will be for "digital mobile radios" for new cellular
telephones that are expected to reach the U.S. market later
in the decade, the spokesman said. Cellular telephones now
employ analog signals; the new digital versions will feature
better voice quality and other improvements, he added.
