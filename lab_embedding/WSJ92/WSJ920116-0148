Tidewater Merger
   With Zapata Gulf
   Is Now Completed
Tidewater said its board will be expanded from seven to 10
to add three former directors of Zapata Gulf. Joining the
board are R.C. Lassiter, chairman and chief executive officer
of Zapata Corp; Lester Pollack, senior managing director of
Corporate Partners, one of Zapata's stockholders; and Ward W.
Woods Jr., president and chief executive officer of Bessemer
Securities Corp., another stockholder of Zapata.
   The company also said that Joseph C. Sarne, Larry T.
Rigdon and Gary D. Pope, vice presidents of Zapata Gulf, will
be elected vice presidents of Tidewater.
   With the closing of the merger, Tidewater received two
loans totaling $100 million, which the company said will be
used to retire Zapata's bank debt.
