Business Brief:
   Ashland Coal to Buy United Co. Unit
   In Bid to Boost Low-Sulfur Coal Output
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Ashland rose
$3 to $31.25.
   Dal-Tex, based in Sharples, W.Va., is an attractive
acquisition because it's efficient and there's great demand
for its product, low-sulfur coal, which meets the
requirements of the federal Clean Air Act. Last year, Dal-Tex
produced about 5.3 million tons of coal. About 3.3 million
tons a year is committed under long-term contracts.
   Buying Dal-Tex adds a lot of debt to Ashland's balance
sheet, increasing the company's debt-to-capital ratio to 58%
from 43%. But the negative effects of piling on debt will be
offset by the low interest rates and by a tax provision that
allows Ashland to pay minimal taxes on its acquisition for
the first several years, said Lehman Brothers analyst Rafael
Villagran.
   Mr. Villagran had feared that this year's earnings could
be diluted by a major acquisition. But the proposed Dal-Tex
deal "wipes out those concerns with one fell swoop," he said.
Dal-Tex could add $10 million to Ashland's cash flow this
year and "more than double or triple" that amount next year,
he said.
   Dal-Tex owns about 22,000 acres with about 220 million
tons of low-sulfur coal in Logan County, W.Va.
