International Brief -- Aer Lingus:
   Fine of $933,300 Imposed
   For Alleged Market Abuse
Aer Lingus said it "finds it strange that the EC
Commission, which has consistently advocated increasing
competition in air transport, is now forcing Aer Lingus to
collaborate with a competitor." Aer Lingus said it may appeal
to the European Court of Justice.
   Aer Lingus ended its ticket-exchange pact with British
Midland in 1989 after the U.K. carrier said it would start
its own service on the London-Dublin route.
