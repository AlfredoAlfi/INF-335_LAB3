Technology Brief -- Microsoft Corp.:
   Apple Computer Increases
   Damage Claim in Lawsuit
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said the amended
damage claim resulted from information disclosed during the
discovery phase of the lawsuit, which was filed more than
three years ago in U.S. district court in San Francisco.
   Apple based its revised claim on an updated analysis by
Robert Hall, a Stanford professor, the company's expert
witness in the lawsuit.
   Mr. Hall found that Apple lost $3.12 billion in profit
from reduced unit sales and depressed selling prices because
of the presence of Microsoft's Windows software in the
market. Apple is also seeking $2.43 billion in Microsoft's
gross revenue from Windows and related products.
