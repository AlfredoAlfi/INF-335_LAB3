Business Brief -- American Electric Power Co.:
   Firm's Unit Gets Approval
   To Continue Development
In pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology, coal
is burned with dolomite, a type of limestone. The sulfur
dioxide released by coal and captured by dolomite eliminates
the need for flue gas desulfurization scrubbers and reduces
nitrous oxide emissions.
   Under other terms of the approval, construction of a PFBC
plant would begin by 1999, or as many as three years earlier
if there is a greater demand for electricity in Appalachian
Power's service area. American Electric Power will also
require public utility commission approval to begin
construction of the proposed plant.
