Official Reserve Assets
   Increased $3.07 Billion
   Last Month, U.S. Says
The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased
$2.23 billion in December to $45.93 billion, while its gold
reserves decreased $1 million to $11.06 billion.
   U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month
rose $298 million to $11.24 billion, and its reserve position
at the IMF increased $545 million to $9.49 billion.
   The Washington-based IMF supervises a supply of money
supported by subscriptions from member nations for the
purpose of stabilizing international exchange and promoting
orderly and balanced trade. Member nations may obtain foreign
currency when needed, making it possible to correct temporary
maladjustments in their balance of payments without currency
depreciation.
