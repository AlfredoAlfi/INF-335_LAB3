Business Brief:
   Regeneron's Fourth-Quarter Net Loss
   More Than Doubled to $2.1 Million
Its full-year loss widened 36% to $4.5 million, or 29
cents a share, from $3.3 million, or 23 cents a share.
Revenue stood at $12.5 million compared with $5 million in
1990.
   Separately, the company, which is developing drugs based
on nerve growth factors (natural proteins that spur
nerve-cell growth) to treat neurological disorders, said it
obtained exclusive licenses to two kinds of growth factors.
One, called the glia maturation factor, was licensed from
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. and the University of Iowa, while
the other, a family of second-generation neurotrophic
molecules, was licensed from Dr. Hakan Persson of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.
   Regeneron also said it completed a pilot manufacturing
facility for recombinantprotein products. It will start with
its leading drug candidate, ciliary neurotrophic factor, or
CNTF. Regeneron said it plans to file for FDA approval to
begin human testing of CNTF in treating amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, in the second quarter.
