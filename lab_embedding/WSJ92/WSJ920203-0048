Business Brief -- Wolverine World Wide Inc.:
   Company Loses a Verdict
   In Federal District Court
Wolverine said it wasn't immediately clear what the final
damages could be.
   Among other charges the suit alleged that Wolverine and
other defendants converted cattle hides of Southwest Hide Co.
and unlawfully interfered with Southwest's business
relations.
   "Wolverine is bitterly disappointed in the jury's
findings," a company official said in a news release. "The
allegations against Woverine are totally without merit and
Wolverine's conduct in this matter was entirely lawful and
consistent with the highest of business ethics."
