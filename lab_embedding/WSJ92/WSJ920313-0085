   How Ty Cobb's Record
   Got Tied Up in Stats
An interesting footnote: While the statistics for the rest
of the 1910 Tigers were corrected in the traditional record
books, Cobb's extra 2 for 3 remains unchanged, which allowed
Ty to nip Nap Lajoie by a percentage point for the 1910
American League batting title even though Lajoie collected a
blemished 8 for 9 on the final day of the season against the
Browns (Cobb .38507 to Lajoie .38409, when Cobb really hit
.38340). Look it up, it's all there in your shirt pocket in
Franklin's Big League Baseball Encyclopedia.
