IMF Approves Credit
   Of $2.1 Billion to Aid
   Brazil Economic Plan
The international agency said that Brazil's adjustment
program "envisages the continued implementation of a very
tight credit policy, a progressive strengthening of fiscal
policy, and ambitious structural reforms."
   The program relies on a flexible exchange rate policy,
includes a two-stage tax reform initiative and seeks to
further privatize public enterprises, the IMF said.
