Germany's BMW Says
   1991 Group Sales Rose
   9.8% to $18.63 Billion
BMW will present full 1991 results at its shareholders
meeting May 12.
   BMW's 1991 preliminary data included for the first time
results from its BMW Rolls-Royce G.m.b.H. joint venture in
Oberursel, of which BMW owns 50.5%.
   The Munich-based group said automobile production in 1991
rose 6.5% to 553,230 units from 519,660 units.
   Group sales rose 5.1% to 552,660 units last year from
525,866 units in 1990, BMW reported, attributing much of that
growth to the reintroduction of its 3-series model.
   In a letter to shareholders, BMW called its 1991 results
"gratifying," but warned that only a sharp rise in demand in
the newly unified domestic market prevented a decline in
sales because of deteriorating economic conditions in its
main export markets.
   In Germany, the company reported a 22% jump in sales to
232,000 units in 1991, from 191,000 in 1990. It said that
overall a total of 4.2 million new automobiles were
registered in Germany, 730,000 of them in eastern Germany.
   In the U.S., sales fell 17% to 53,000 units, from 63,600
units in 1990. BMW cited the "luxury" sales tax of 10% on
cars costing over $30,000, introduced at the beginning of
1991, as being partly responsible for the decline.
   The company said it expected both production and sales to
register further growth in 1992.
