Unemployment Rate
   In Australia Climbed
   To 10.5% in February
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Economists generally had expected the unemployment rate to
rise to 10.6% in February. They had expected employment to
fall around 30,000.
   The bureau said its seasonally adjusted work-force
participation rate, or the proportion of working-age persons
at work or actively looking for work, fell to 63.2% in
February from 63.3% in January and 63.6% a year earlier.
   Full-time employment fell 43,600 in February, with drops
of 35,600 for males and 8,000 for females. Part-time
employment rose 31,100, with the the number of males employed
part time rising 37,500.
   The bureaus's longer-term trend estimate of total
employment, which takes irregular factors out of the data,
"continued the succession of small rises since October 1991."
However, this gain results from a trend rise in part-time
employment, rather than full-time employment.
   Australia's unemployment rate rose above 10% last
September as the economy sunk deeper into recession. It
reached 10.6% in December, the highest level for decades. The
government has predicted unemployment could rise a bit
further before declining.
