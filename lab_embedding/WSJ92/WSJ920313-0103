Business Brief -- American Dental Laser Inc.:
   Company Expects Net Loss
   Of $3.6 Million for Quarter
For all of 1991, the company expects to "be near break
even."
   American Dental previously said it expected a
fourth-quarter net loss of $1.6 million. But the company said
it revised the estimate partly because of the accrual of
additional expenses primarily related to European operations.
   For the current quarter, American Dental expects to report
a net loss of $2 million. A year earlier, the company earned
$1.3 million, or 21 cents a share. Sales were $8.2 million.
   American Dental said it's seeking a chief operating
officer to strengthen the company's operations.
