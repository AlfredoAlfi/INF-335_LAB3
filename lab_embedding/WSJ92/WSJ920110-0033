   Daily News Retains
   Salomon as Adviser
   To Develop a Plan
The Daily News, which was owned by the late Robert
Maxwell, filed last month for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after disclosures of
financial mismanagement in Mr. Maxwell's private holdings.
The paper is currently being run by Daily News managers and
overseen by the London court-appointed administrators of the
private Robert Maxwell Group, which is separate from Maxwell
Communication Corp., the London-based publicly traded
publishing concern.
   The paper's management also reported that it had $8.9
million in cash on hand as of the beginning of this week.
Howard Seife, an attorney at the firm of Winston  Strawn who
represents the creditors, said the paper's cash position
exceeded expectations.
   Mr. Seife also said the paper is negotiating with its
landlord, LaSalle Partners, to reduce its rent at the Daily
News building in Manhattan. The current rent is $1 million a
month, Mr. Seife said.
