Justices to Hear Key Case
   On Abortion Next Month
The case involves a challenge to a Pennsylvania law that
imposes a number of restrictions on women seeking abortions,
including a requirement that they tell their husbands of
their intentions.
   The high court could use the case as an opportunity to
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that recognized a
constitutional right to abortion. But the justices could
uphold the Pennsylvania law without explicitly reversing Roe.
