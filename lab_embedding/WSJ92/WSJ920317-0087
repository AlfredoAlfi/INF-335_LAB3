Redlaw Expects Loss
   In Current Fiscal Year
Mr. Chandler said he expects Redlaw will have profit next
year of about 60 Canadian cents a share, helped by a better
performance at 45.6%-owned Johnston Industries Inc., a New
York textile manufacturer. Expected strong sales gains and
higher profit margins should boost Johnston's per-share
earnings from an estimated 80 cents in the current fiscal
year ending June 30 to about $1.25 next year and to $1.60 in
fiscal 1994, he said.
   To revive GRM Industries, Redlaw plans to replace the
unit's senior management and diversify into other areas of
manufacturing, especially home furnishings, Mr. Chandler
said. Redlaw also plans to raise C$6 million to C$8 million
from an equity offering sometime this year to reduce GRM's
debt, he said. The unit currently is in default on C$16.3
million of debt.
