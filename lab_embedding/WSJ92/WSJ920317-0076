Letters to the Editor:
   Public Citizen Denies
   Scientology Fund Link
As we tell anyone who asks (you didn't), Public Citizen
accepts no money whatsoever from any business or government
source, nor does it take money from lawyer organizations or
Scientologists. Less than 1% of our income is from
individuals who happen to be lawyers. We have 100,000 members
nationwide, and more than 80,000 people subscribe to our
Health Letter.
