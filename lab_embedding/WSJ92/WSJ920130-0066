Business Brief -- ConAgra Inc.:
   OSHA's Charges on Safety
   Settled by $425,000 Penalty
Originally, OSHA had sought about $1 million for
violations it said it found in 1989 at a ConAgra
turkey-processing plant in Carthage, Mo. The citations
covered 48 alleged instances of ergonomic hazards and 181
alleged instances of improper recordkeeping. The company
didn't admit any wrongdoing in the settlement.
   Meat-processing employees can suffer injury from
repetitive motions required by their work on slaughter-house
processing lines. The ergonomics management program is
"designed to control cumulative trauma disorders such as
carpal tunnel syndrome among workers in ConAgra poultry
processing plants," OSHA said.
