U.S. Initially Decides
   It Won't Add to Duties
   On Fans From China
Peter Feller, a lawyer for the petitioner, said the
department reached a negative finding because it is still
"struggling" with the question of how to treat socialist
countries in transition toward a market economy. Lasko claims
that the Chinese manufacturers are unfairly subsidized, but
whether relief in the form of countervailing duties, which
would compensate for the subsidies, is granted depends on how
the U.S. regards the nature of some of their financing.
   The department said the imports of these Chinese fans
amounted to $140 million in 1990.
