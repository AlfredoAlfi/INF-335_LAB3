Credit Ratings
YASUDA TRUST  BANKING Co. and MITSUI TRUST  BANKING Co.
(Tokyo) -- Standard  Poor's Corp. lowered the long-term debt
ratings of these two Japanese banks, citing deteriorating
asset quality and declining profitability because of falling
interest rates. Ratings on debt of Yasuda Trust and several

SP said the outlook on long-term debt issued or guaranteed
by the bank is stable. About $6.5 billion of debt is affected
by the rating change. The debt of Mitsui Trust and its Mitsui
Trust Finance (Hong Kong) Ltd. subsidiary was downgraded to
single-A from single-A-plus. The outlook on debt issued or
guaranteed by the bank was revised to negative from stable.
About $800 million in debt is affected by the rating change.
