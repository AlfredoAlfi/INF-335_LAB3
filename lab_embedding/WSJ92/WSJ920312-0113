Pepper...and Salt
Eight people went into Bio-sphere II,
   A microcosm of Earth;
   For two years they'll be separated
   From all they've known since birth.
   They're there to make a study of what
   This planet is all about;
   Four men, four women went into it --
   How many will come out?

   Cold Calculation
                                                                                                       

   Many things expand in the heat
   And contract in the cold, we know,
   But my driveway seems to be different --
   It gets wider as I shovel snow.
