Business Brief -- Illinois Power Co.:
   Firm Gets 9.2% Rate Boost
   After Requesting 17% Rise
The panel declined to allow certain postconstruction costs
of the Clinton plant, but said it would entertain a request
for a rehearing on those matters. If Illinois Power's claims
prevail in the expected rehearing, it could gain an
additional $19 million in rate relief. "The rehearing process
should be completed in about six months," the company said.
   Standard  Poor's Corp. reacted to the commission's ruling
by upgrading the ratings on Illinois Power senior secured
debt to triple-B-plus from triple-B, and its senior unsecured
debt to triple-B from triple-B-minus. The rating concern
affirmed the utility's preferred stock at triple-B-minus, and
the A-2 rating on Illinois Power's commercial paper.
