CBOT Plans to Buy
   Bond Trading System
   From Joint Venture
Terms of the pact weren't disclosed.
   The move is unique because many members of the exchange
buy and sell futures contracts for government securities.
When the acquisition is completed, traders of U.S. Treasury
futures contracts would be able to make their own bids and
offers for the underlying commodity as well as have the
ability to accept the bids and offers of primary dealers.
   Theoretically, this arrangement eases the way for traders
to take advantage of price differences between government
securities and futures contracts. The CBOT dominates futures
trading in U.S. Treasury futures.
   EJV Brokerage has about 170 terminals in place on the
trading desks of 35 primary government securities dealers, or
those that trade directly with the Federal Reserve, in New
York, Chicago and San Francisco.
   A definitive agreement is subject to approval by the
exchange's directors and members.
