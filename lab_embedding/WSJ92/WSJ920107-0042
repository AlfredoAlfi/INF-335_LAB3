Citicorp Unit Agrees
   To Market Insurance
   For Aetna in Florida
Last June, Citicorp won a federal appeals court's
permission to underwrite and sell insurance nationwide
through its Delaware subsidiary. That decision is on appeal,
however, and the bank has put those efforts on hold until it
becomes clear whether the Supreme Court will hear the case,
the spokesman said.
   Currently, banks are allowed to sell credit-related
insurance products to their customers. Citicorp, which offers
a type of mortgage insurance to its mortgage customers, will
also market homeowners' insurance to those customers, the
spokesman said.
   An Aetna spokesman said a decision will be made in the
first quarter on whether to extend the Florida arrangement to
California.
   Citicorp will market the insurance, while Aetna, based in
Hartford, Conn., will underwrite the product. "We're using
them to do the selling," an Aetna spokeswoman said. "We want
to expand in the homeowners' line, and this is a way for us
to reach a greater number of customers."
