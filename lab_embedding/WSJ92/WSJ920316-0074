Business Brief -- Stevens Graphics Corp.:
   Texas Concern Reaches Pact
   To Restructure Senior Debt
The new agreements call for Stevens, a maker of printing
presses, to pledge assets to secure the debt. Stevens said
the agreement also means it isn't in default any longer on
certain covenants, as it has been since reporting a loss for
the fourth quarter of 1990.
   Under the agreement, which Stevens said it hopes to
complete by March 31, the company's bank credit line will be
extended to Jan. 31, 1994, from an original maturity this
June. But the maximum amount it can borrow under the line
will be reduced to $26 million from $38 million.
