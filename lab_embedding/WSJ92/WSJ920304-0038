Marketing  Media:
   Visa Doubles the Number
   Of Business Card Holders
The latest announcement by Visa comes in the wake of
increased competition among credit card issuers for business
accounts. At stake is more than $300 billion in
business-related purchases that company employees are
expected to make this year.
   Although Visa and MasterCard International have been
making small gains since launching their business card
product three years ago, American Express Co. still dominates
the business card market with 88 of the top 100 companies
issuing its "corporate" card.
