The secondary offering, postponed last November when
Clayton  Dubilier withdrew its registration request, is to
be underwritten by Goldman, Sachs  Co. and Donaldson Lufkin
 Jenrette Securities Corp. The company said that some of the
shares are expected to be sold by management investors, but
that none of these investors are expected to sell more than
19% of their shares.
