Thorn Expanding Rental Line
A provision for restructuring costs will be taken as an
extraordinary item in the financial year ending March 31,
Thorn said. It didn't specify the size of the charge. An
extraordinary item doesn't alter pretax profit.
   The addition of profits to the rental chain should balance
out reductions at the retail chain, Thorn said.
