Colonial Realty's Shuch
   Commits Suicide at Home
In December 1990, a U.S. grand jury charged Mr. Shuch with
40 fraud counts in the collapse of Colonial, which syndicated
about $370 million in 85 real estate partnerships, mainly to
individual Connecticut investors.
   The death of Mr. Shuch, who was Colonial's chief financial
officer and one of the firm's three main figures, leaves many
unanswered questions about the collapse. The U.S. Attorney's
office in Connecticut, which has an ongoing criminal
investigation of other possible wrongdoing at Colonial,
declined comment.
   Mr. Shuch's indictment charged him with siphoning off $6
million of Colonial's money for his own account, and of using
forged documents to obtain $10 million in loans for the
company's limited partnerships. Unable to meet its loan
obligations or to pay investors distributions, Colonial
entered bankruptcy reorganization in September 1990.
