Business Brief -- Bell Atlantic Corp.:
   New Jersey Assembly Passes
   Bill Aimed at Deregulation
The bill passed late Friday would allow state regulators
to liberalize New Jersey Bell's rates in return for its
investment in the new fiber-optic lines. Assembly Speaker
Joseph T. Doria, sponsor of the bill, said the state "cannot
allow old and antiquated regulations to impede progress." But
consumer advocacy groups have said previously that many of
the proposed new services available by fiber-optic lines
would be too costly for many ratepayers, or that most
ratepayers would make little use of those services.
   The bill now goes to Gov. James Florio, who has previously
expressed strong support for the regulatory change.
   New Jersey Bell is a unit of Bell Atlantic Corp. Officials
of Bell Atlantic couldn't be reached to comment.
