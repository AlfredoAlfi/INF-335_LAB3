LaWare Says Further Cuts
   In Rates Aren't Necessary
He said the Fed should let time pass to see if earlier
interest rate cuts are working. "If we find it is not enough,
we are all prepared to go further," he said. "But I don't see
the need for that at this time."
   Sounding more certain than some other Fed officials have
in recent days, Mr. LaWare also said, "We are in a recovery.
Each quarter will show a better rate of growth. It will be
moderate growth, something close to 2% in 1992." Next year
will be better, he added.
   Mr. LaWare initially opposed the interest-rate cuts the
Fed made in December. But in the end, he voted with the
majority to go along.
