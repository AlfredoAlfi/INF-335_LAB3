Technology Brief -- Avitar Inc.:
   Firm to License Blood Test
   In Peridontal Disease Search
Current tests for peridontal disease involve using a probe
to find bacteria in the gums, and those probes must reach
many spots to be sure of finding the disease and generally
they don't detect bacteria until the disease is advanced.
Peridontal disease is among the most common problems with
teeth, affecting 25 million to 50 million Americans, Avitar
said.
   The test involves a simple pin-prick to draw blood that is
subsequently screened at an Avitar laboratory. Mr. Phildius
said Avitar is currently negotiating with a marketing partner
and hopes to start selling the test in June. It doesn't
require Food and Drug Administration approval, he said.
Avitar said it expects the test to be priced between $20 and
$30.
   Avitar develops new medical products and finds partners to
sell them.
