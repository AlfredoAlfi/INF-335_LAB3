Program Trading
Of the program total on the Big Board, 53.1% involved
stock-index arbitrage, up from 39.7% the prior week. In this
strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options
and futures to capture fleeting price differences.
   Some 46.4% of program trading reflected firms' trading for
their own accounts, or principal trading, while 44.7%
involved trading for customers. An additional 8.9% was
executed by firms using principal positions to facilitate
customer trades.
   Of the five most-active firms, two did most or all their
program trading for their own accounts, rather than for
customers. They were: Nomura Securities and Kidder, Peabody &
Co.
