Business Brief -- Sabena:
   Belgium's National Carrier
   Estimates 9-Month Profit
The latest results confirm Sabena's progress since April,
when it turned in a monthly profit for the first time in 18
months. "This proves that the restructuring efforts are
bearing fruit," Sabena said in a statement.
   Operating profit, at 2.1 billion francs, broke the two
billion francs mark for the first time in the airline's
history.
   The nine-month estimated results were released Friday,
just as Belgium's caretaker government failed to clear the
acquisition of 37.5% of Sabena by Air France and Belgian
partners for six billion francs.
   The government's failure to clear the deal risked plunging
the airline into a "negative spiral" with irreversible social
and economic consequences, Sabena warned. "We need a
partner," said a spokeswoman. "Sabena is too small to stay on
its own."
