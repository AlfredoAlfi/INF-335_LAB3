Technology Brief -- Storage Technology Corp.:
   Matsushita Unit to Provide
   Tape-Library Technology
The new product is a bit slower than other tape-library
systems, but because of its massive storage capacity, Storage
Technology thinks it will be popular with supercomputer
users. Joseph Beal, a Storage Technology vice president,
wouldn't estimate the size of the market for the new product,
but said it would be a major part of the company's product
line. Storage Technology has more than 90% of the market for
automated tape libraries.f
