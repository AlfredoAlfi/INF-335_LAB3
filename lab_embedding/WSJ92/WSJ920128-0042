Business Brief -- Coca-Cola Co.:
   India Approves Investment
   By Company Joint Venture
The venture will mark a re-entry into India for Coca-Cola,
which left the country in 1977 when the government was
seeking the release of the beverage maker's secret formula.
Rival PepsiCo Inc., which won approval to operate there in
1988, has 18 plants operating and claims a 20% share of the
market.
   Coca-Cola said the government approval will enable Jmrpco
to participate in an Indian venture with Britannia Industries
Ltd., a publicly held company based in Calcutta and India's
largest food processing company. The venture will set up
operations for exporting snack foods and making domestic
beverages.
