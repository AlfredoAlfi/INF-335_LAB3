International Brief -- British Petroleum PLC:
   French Unit Makes Offer
   For Rest of Gerland S.A.
BP is offering 665 francs a share for all the shares that
it doesn't control. The offer price is almost 15% above the
most recent trading price for Gerland shares and is about 23%
higher than the average traded price over the past month.
   BP France said Gerland's board will meet soon to consider
the offer. Gerland doesn't have any major shareholders apart
from BP France.
   Gerland's profitability fell steeply in 1990. The company
posted a consolidated net profit of 99.9 million francs, down
from 169.5 million francs a year before. Consolidated revenue
fell to 3.62 billion francs from 3.64 billion francs.
   The fall in earnings reflected a drop in nonrecurring
gains to 11 million francs from 63 million francs, as well as
changes in Gerland's structure.
