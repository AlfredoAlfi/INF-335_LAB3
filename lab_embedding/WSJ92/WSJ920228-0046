Business Brief -- ConAgra Inc.:
   Stock Tumbles as Analyst
   Cuts Her Earnings Estimate
The downgrade depressed the stock to $28 a share on volume
of more than three million shares in what Ms. Ghez
characterized as an over-reaction. Other industry analysts
said they were holding at earlier estimates, which before
yesterday ranged between $1.55 and $1.68 a share. A ConAgra
spokesman said the weaknesses Ms. Ghez cited have been
"common knowledge for many, many months. It's a judgment call
on her part as to the degree."
