Business Brief -- Kemper Corp.:
   Financial Services Unit Plans
   To Boost Institutional Base
As part of the plan, Kemper Financial will form a new
holding company, into which it will fold its Kemper Asset
Management Co. division -- which manages both fixed-income
and equity portfolios for institutions in the U.S. -- and its
London-based Kemper Investment Management Co., which focuses
on fixed-income asset management for international customers.
   S.A. Lincoln, formerly president of Kemper Asset
Management, was named chief executive officer of the new
holding company. John Angley, formerly managing director at
S.E.I., a Chicago financial services and investment
consulting firm, was named to succeed Mr. Lincoln as
president of Kemper Asset Management.
