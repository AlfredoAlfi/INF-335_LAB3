Business Brief:
   Unisys to Post Profit
   For the First Quarter;
   Cost-Cutting Is Cited
The first-quarter forecast is better than analysts had
predicted and gave Unisys shares a boost. Analyst estimates
had ranged from a loss of seven cents a share to break-even.
Mr. Unruh, speaking to analysts here yesterday, declined to
be specific about the expected earnings this quarter. The
company had its first profit in eight quarters in the fourth
period of 1991.
   Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., had a loss of $98
million, or 79 cents a share, on revenue of $2.06 billion in
the first quarter last year.
   Mr. Unruh reiterated that the company would be profitable
for the year. He said 1992 revenue would decline somewhat
from the $8.7 billion of 1991, but it would be more modest
than the 14% decline from 1990, when revenue was $10.11
billion. For last year, Unisys reported a loss of $1.4
billion, or $9.37 a share, compared with a 1990 loss of
$436.7 million, or $3.45 a share.
   Unisys shares were quoted at $10.125, up $1, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, with more than
2.5 million shares changing hands.
