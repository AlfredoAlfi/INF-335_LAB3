Grolsch declined to disclose the terms under discussion.
It said Ruddles has annual sales of about 100 million
guilders ($55 million). Grolsch's annual sales total around
800 million guilders. The company, based in Enschede, the
Netherlands, nearly doubled its size a year ago by acquiring
Wickuler Group, a German brewer.
   After buying Wickuler, Grolsch said its next aim was to
acquire a premium British ale.
   "I think it's a very logical deal," said Eric Frankis, a
brewing analyst at UBS Phillips  Drew in London. Although
the mass-produced, pasteurized ales have lost considerable
market share over the past decade, real ales have grown
quickly as people have sought out drinks viewed as
distinctive and traditional.
   Mr. Frankis noted Courage would still have two major real
ale brands, Best Bitter and Directors, after selling Ruddles.
Courage obtained Ruddles and a number of other brands last
year as part of a swap of assets with Grand Metropolitan PLC.
   Though Ruddles is considered a strong brand, some beer
connoisseurs argue that it has lost some of its aura since
Grand Met acquired the brand in the 1986 and pumped up both
sales volume and marketing. "We think that the quality has
declined," said Roger Protz, a spokesman for the Campaign for
Real Ale, a lobbying group that has long denounced giant beer
companies for swallowing up regional breweries and reducing
variety in the market.
   A Courage spokesman declined to discuss quality but said,
"Ruddles ales are very well-respected, and they're selling
well."
