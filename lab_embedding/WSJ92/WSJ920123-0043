San Diego Gas Agrees to Cuts
Also, the utility said the $66 million rate decrease
reflects in part a $19 million legal settlement.
   The agreement must be approved by the utilities
commission, and a decision is expected in April. If approved,
San Diego Gas said a typical residential monthly bill would
fall $1.51 to $64.38.
