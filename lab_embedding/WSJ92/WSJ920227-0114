TJX Takes a Charge,
   Posts 4th-Period Loss
   Totaling $36 Million
TJX also said it plans to close 75 of its 576 Hit or Miss
division clothing stores in an effort to reduce losses in
that division.
   Sales for the quarter rose 12% to $799.7 million from
$714.1 million.
   TJX said that "three of our four divisions performed
extremely well," with T.J. Maxx stores, Chadwick's of Boston
mail order operation and Winners Apparel Ltd. increasing
sales and earnings. However, operating losses at Hit or Miss
widened to $26.5 million from $7.4 million.
   TJX said that before the $50 million charge, earnings from
continuing operations in the latest quarter amounted to $14
million or 20 cents a share, down 8% from $15.3 million.
   On another matter, TJX said it plans to improve its
balance sheet by selling an issue of convertible preferred
stock to institutional investors in a private placement.
Terms and amounts weren't disclosed. In a process known as
defeasance, proceeds will be used to purchase U.S. Treasury
notes that will pay off the principal and interest on its $50
million of 8.125% notes maturing May 1, 1993. The transaction
is expected to result in a charge of $1.3 million in the
current quarter.
