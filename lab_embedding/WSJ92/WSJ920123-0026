McKinsey May Halt Paying
   For Discriminatory Clubs
Robert Dennis, a McKinsey partner, said that senior North
American partners will consider guidelines forbidding the
payments at a meeting next month. "The intent of the
guidelines would be not to reimburse club memberships that
are exclusive based on gender, race or religion," he said. "I
had never recognized it as an issue until it was brought to
our attention" at Harvard.
   Critics faulted McKinsey for previously ignoring exclusive
clubs. "The Bank of America adopted the first policy of this
nature in 1976," said Lynn Hecht Schafran, an attorney for
the National Organization for Women's legal fund. "It is
disturbing that McKinsey is so late in taking action on this
issue."
   Mr. Dennis added that McKinsey remains committed to a
diversified work force. The consulting firm currently has 19
women but no blacks among its 404 partners world-wide.
