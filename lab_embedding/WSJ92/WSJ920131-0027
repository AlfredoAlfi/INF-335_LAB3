Business Brief -- USX Corp.:
   U.S. Steel Results Expected
   To Improve During 1992
Mr. Corry also noted that Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s
departure from its bar, rod and wire operations may help U.S.
Steel in the bar market. He said U.S. Steel has "nothing
further in mind" concerning more cutbacks of its own.
   He termed USX's Marathon Oil unit's Sakhalin Island
venture in Russia with McDermott International Inc. and
Mitsui  Co. a "very major field," and a "very important
project." The field's estimated reserves of hydrocarbons are
twice as large as Marathon's total reserves, he said.
However, he said Marathon has had no further exploration
successes in Tunisia. Marathon's first Tunisian well is
producing an average of 10,000 to 12,000 barrels a day. USX
is based in Pittsburgh.
