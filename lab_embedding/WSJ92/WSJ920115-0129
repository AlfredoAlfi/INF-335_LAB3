International:
   Singapore Tourism Rose in 1991
Mr. Pek also said that an increasing focus on Asian
markets helped the industry recover more quickly from the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis. At the end of 1991, some
68% of all visitors came from Asia.
   Within Asia though, Japan proved the toughest with its
share of arrivals to Singapore falling to 16% in 1991 from
1990's 18% level.
   Part of the reason, Mr. Pek noted, was a shift in Japanese
visitor preferences away from shopping and holiday packages
towards leisure-oriented holidays. Since September, the
number of visitors from Japan has been on the rise, he said.
