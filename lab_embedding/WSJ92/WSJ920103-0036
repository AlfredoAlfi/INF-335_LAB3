Business Brief -- Canyon Resources Corp.:
   Concern Drops 15% Interest
   In Beartrack Gold Property
Combined with a fourth-quarter gold-loan repayment of
about $1.8 million, the move will reduce the company's total
debt to about $9.5 million at the end of the year from about
$17.5 million, which it reported on Sept. 30, 1991.
   Canyon, which discovered the Beartrack property, said it
relinquished its remaining interest to FMC Gold, which is the
project operator, because of a low rate of return projected
from the investment. The project is fully permitted by
various government agencies, and may eventually produce
635,000 ounces of gold if FMC decides to develop a mine at
the site.
