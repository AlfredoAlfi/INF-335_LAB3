Business Brief -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Loss Posted
   Against Year-Earlier Profit
The fourth-quarter loss was $125 million, or $1.07 a
share, vs. profit of $11.1 million, or six cents a share, a
year ago. Revenue rose 1.3% to $947.9 million from $935.4
million.
   The 1991 loss was $82.4 million, or 79 cents a share, vs.
profit of $93.4 million, or 65 cents a share, in 1990. The
projection of weak 1992 results didn't surprise analysts. The
industry has been hampered in recent months by an inability
to raise beverage prices in the face of the recession.
