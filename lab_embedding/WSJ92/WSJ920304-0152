School-Choice Law
   In Wisonsin Upheld
   By State High Court
The court, in reversing a state appeals court decision,
ruled that the law doesn't violate the doctrine of spending
state money for the public good, in part because the private
schools benefiting from the vouchers are supervised well
enough "to attain the public purpose of improving educational
quality."
   Robert Friebert, an attorney for the Wisconsin school
groups who challenged the law, said he was disappointed, and
added that the groups were considering their options,
including a federal lawsuit. No federal constitutional issues
were raised in the Wisconsin court battle.
   Under the law, about 550 inner-city Milwaukee children
attend private schools, receiving $2,500 apiece from the
state. To qualify for the vouchers, students must attend
non-sectarian private schools, and come from families earning
less than 175% of the federal poverty threshold, meaning a
family of four must have annual income below about $23,000.
The bulk of voucher recipients are black children, whose
parents have expressed frustration with the quality of
inner-city schools.
