Business Brief -- Alliant Techsystems Inc.:
   Defense Concern Will Cut
   Jobs, Take Pretax Charge
The layoffs will be accomplished in two phases, one being
completed by the end of March, and the second by the end of
June. Between 500 and 600 office, technical and managerial
employees, as well as union employees throughout the
company's defense and marine systems and information storage
businesses, will be affected. Alliant has 7,100 employees
world-wide.
   The Minneapolis defense concern said the reductions, which
aren't related to its performance during the quarter, are
part of its commitment to "consolidate and streamline"
operations in anticipation of continuing changes in the
defense industry. It said the reductions will reduce its
annual expenses by $25 million.
