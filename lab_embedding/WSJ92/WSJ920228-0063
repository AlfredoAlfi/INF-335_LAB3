Business Brief:
   Johnson  Johnson
   Divides Ethicon Unit
   Into Two Companies
Kurt Kruger, a health-care analyst at investment banking
firm Hambrecht  Quist in New York, estimated that the $12
billion health-care products company's endoscopy business had
revenue of about $70 million to $75 million last year, while
the total Ethicon unit, which markets surgical sutures,
needles, ligatures and adhesion prevention products, had
total revenue of about $1.2 billion.
   Mr. Kruger said that by dividing the business, Johnson 
Johnson "is trying to gain greater nimbleness. It is a faster
growing, more exciting market to be in." Johnson  Johnson
has faced stiff competiton from U.S. Surgical Corp., Norwalk,
Conn., which he said has "stolen the less-invasive market and
caught Ethicon somewhat flat-footed."
   The new domestic Ethicon Endo-Surgery business, based in
Cincinnati, will be headed by William C. Weldon, 43 years
old, currently vice president of marketing and sales for the
Janssen Pharmaceutica subsidiary. He will report to Robert W.
Croce, world-wide president of Ethicon Endo-Surgery and a
corporate international vice president.
   Ethicon Inc., Somerville, N.J., will be headed by Frank J.
Ryan, 52, currently president of Johnson  Johnson Hospital
Services Inc. He will report to company group Chairman Frank
G. Fitzpatrick.
