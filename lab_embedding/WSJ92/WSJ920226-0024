Marketing  Media:
   JJ Can Sell Tylenol PM
   Pending Court Arguments
Both products have dark-blue and light-blue packaging.
Excedrin PM has been on the market about 20 years, while
Tylenol PM was introduced about a year ago. Johnson 
Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., has placed Tylenol
PM's annual sales at $60 million. Bristol-Myers, New York,
declined to disclose Excedrin PM sales.
   Johnson  Johnson sought the stay after a federal judge in
Uniondale, N.Y., last week issued a temporary injunction
against the sale of the product. The judge, Arthur D. Spatt,
said Johnson  Johnson "acted in bad faith" in packaging
Tylenol PM in a similar way to Bristol-Myer's Excedrin PM
with the intention of confusing consumers. The appeals court
will hear additional arguments in April, a spokeswoman for
Bristol-Myers said.
