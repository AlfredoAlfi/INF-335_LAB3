   Philips Electronics
   To Pay $175 Million
   For 25% of Whittle
Under the terms, the Dutch consumer electronics giant
could raise its stake to 33% by 1994 for additional cash,
which would be determined based on Whittle's performance. A
Whittle executive said that in exchange for the reduced
stakes, the general partners would receive credit in a
central "partnership account," from which Whittle can draw
money and the partners can take out funds over time.
   Mr. Whittle said the Philips investment would help fund
further expansion of the Channel One TV show for schools, new
acquisitions, possibly in retail areas, and new media
products that will be introduced in the next six months. "We
see Philips as a huge technology lab we can draw on," he
said.
   Philips's Consumer Electronics Co., based in Knoxville,
has already sold more than 300,000 TV sets to Whittle for its
Channel One project and 32,000 video monitors for a service
aimed at the waiting rooms of doctors' offices.
   In addition to the Philips investment, Whittle executives
said the various partners would invest about $60 million in
the Edison Project, a plan to set up a national network of
for-profit schools.
