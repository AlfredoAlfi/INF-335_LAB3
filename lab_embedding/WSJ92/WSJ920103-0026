Business Brief -- Galactic Resources Ltd.:
   Nearly All Mining Assets
   To Be Sold for Reclamation
Galactic has retained Gordon Capital Corp. of Toronto to
find a buyer for the company's 50% stake in the Ivanhoe mine
in Nevada. He expects the sale will fetch at least $15
million. But Galactic's California property will be harder to
sell. As a first step, Galactic will try to sell it to the
state to add to a neighboring park, he said.
   "I'm going to take the company back to square one and
start again," said Peter Guest, Galactic's president and
chief executive officer. He plans to rebuild by acquiring
gold properties in the advanced exploration stage in South
America.
