International Brief -- Finnair Oy:
   Finnish Carrier and Aeroflot
   Agree to Form New Airline
The airline will fly from the Russian city to cities in
Western Europe, most likely in Germany and possibly Brussels
and London, said Finnair Information Officer Leo Bjorkroth.
   The company plans to rent four of Finnair's McDonnell
Douglas DC-9 aircraft, Mr. Bjorkroth said. "Finnair will
begin training programs for Aeroflot pilots and ground staff
next fall and winter," he said.
   If all goes according to schedule, the airline will be
able to start service in the summer of 1993, Finnair
officials said.
