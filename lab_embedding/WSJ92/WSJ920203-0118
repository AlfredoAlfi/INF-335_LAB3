Green Equity Bids for Arimco
The offer exceeds an existing bid for Arimco, valued at
A$53 million, made in December by Plutonic Resources Ltd, an
Australian gold-mining company that is 30% owned by Malaysia
Mining Corp.
   Both bids are conditioned on approval from Australia's
Foreign Investment Review Board and on the bidders receiving
acceptances for at least 90% of Arimco's shares.
