Quayle Defends Economy,
   Prods Banks to Lend More
"The banks need to get back on their feet. They need to
build up their reserves. But they also need to start making
loans. . . rather than just buying Treasury bills," Mr.
Quayle said.
   On a whirlwind bus tour of small villages in the nation's
leadoff primary state, the vice president also defended
President Bush's trip to Japan against suggestions that it
had not produced breakthroughs on trade. "You're not going to
see grandiose announcements," Quayle told the Littleton
Chamber of Commerce in the northern part of the state.
"That's not the way things are done."
