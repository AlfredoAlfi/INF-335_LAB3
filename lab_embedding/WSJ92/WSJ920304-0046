International:
   Hyundai Will Be Allowed
   To Issue Corporate Bonds
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The government restraint, the companies believe,
represents political retaliation for the forming of a
political party in January by Chung Ju Yung, founder of
Hyundai, the nation's second largest business group.
   Analysts and bankers said the permission to issue bonds
isn't a sign that alleged financial sanctions on the group's
42 subsidiaries are easing, but rather provides funding so
the company can pay its bills. Hyundai has claimed that a
third of the nation's manufacturers will face bankruptcy if
the Hyundai group dishonors its bills as a result of the
shortage of cash flow.
