Greenspan Supports
   SEC Registration
   Of Sponsored Entities
"Clarifying that there are no guarantees -- either
explicit or implicit -- would lessen the pressure on the
government to act in the unlikely event that a GSE
{government-sponsored enterprise} faltered," Mr. Greenspan
said.
   The registration proposal, unveiled this year in a report
issued jointly by the Treasury, the Fed and the SEC, has
encountered strong opposition from the enterprises -- the
Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., the Student Loan Marketing Association, the
Federal Home Loan Banks and the Farm Credit System. These
entities maintain that registration would drive up their
costs and thus increase the burden on beneficiaries of their
programs. Rep. Markey and Senate Securities Subcommittee
Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) have indicated they
won't attempt to affix the registration proposal to pending
government securities legislation, leaving its fate in doubt.
