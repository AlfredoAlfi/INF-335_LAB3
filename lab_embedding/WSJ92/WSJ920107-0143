Lionel Corp. to Settle
   Charges of Violating
   SEC Disclosure Rules
The allegations focused on talks between Lionel and an
investor group led by Robert I. Toussie of New York after
Toussie launched a tender offer for Lionel in October 1989.
In January 1990, the Toussie group dropped its $8-a-share or
$95 million bid shortly after another investment group with
ties to Lionel management bought half of the Toussie stake
for $7 a share.
   Both prices were considerable premiums to the market value
at the time, about $5.50 a share. Immediately after the
Toussie group announced the end of its offer and a settlement
with Lionel, the share price plummeted to about $3. It since
has steadily eroded to a current 43.75 cents on the American
Stock Exchange.
   As reported, stock-transaction records showed the second
group was financed by Bernard Marden, who with a partner
owned a media-buying company that had Lionel among its
clients. It still isn't clear why Mr. Marden was interested
in owning the stake -- and at such a high price.
   Neither Mr. Marden nor Lionel officials could be reached
for comment. Mr. Toussie also couldn't be reached.
