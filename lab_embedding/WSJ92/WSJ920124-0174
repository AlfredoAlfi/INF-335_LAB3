Dividend News:
   Onex to Distribute
   Reinvestment Rights
   For Special Dividend
Mr. Lewtas said the company hopes shareholders who
received a special dividend of 80.7 million Canadian dollars
($69.8 million), or C$3.50 ($3.03) a share, on Dec. 31
following the sale of the company's 70% stake in Beatrice
Foods Inc., will use the rights to buy Onex shares.
   Each right will entitle the holder to buy an unspecified
number of Onex subordinate voting shares at a
yet-to-be-determined price, the company said. There are
currently 22 million subordinate voting shares outstanding.
Mr. Lewtas said he doesn't know how many rights the company
expects to distribute or the number of subordinate voting
shares that will subsequently be issued.
   Once regulatory approval is received, the rights will be
distributed to registered shareholders and investors who sold
Onex shares between Dec. 19 and Jan. 22, the company said.
Onex is including investors that have already sold shares
because they were promised, last November, the opportunity to
reinvest their dividend proceeds in Onex subordinate voting
shares.
   Onex, based in Toronto, is an industrial holding company.
In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Onex
closed at C$6.125, down 12.5 Canadian cents.
