Deportation of Doherty,
   IRA Figure, Clears Court
The Supreme Court, in a splintered decision, reversed a
1990 ruling by the federal appeals court in New York that
former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had "abused his
discretion" when he refused to reopen deportation proceedings
for Mr. Doherty. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the
majority opinion; four other justices endorsed the basic
outcome, if not all of the chief justice's reasoning.
   The Justice Department, which had appealed the case to the
Supreme Court, is expected to move quickly to deport Mr.
Doherty. A spokeswoman said department officials were
"gratified" by the decision but were studying it, looking for
any remaining legal obstacles to the deportation.
   The court in Northern Ireland had sentenced Mr. Doherty in
absentia to life imprisonment. Before the verdict was
returned, he had escaped from prison and eventually fled to
the U.S.
