   Campbell Soup Co.
   Realigns Businesses
   Into Two Divisions
In addition, the company named Robert Subin president of a
new Europe/Asia division. That division incorporates
Campbell's businesses in Europe, Australia, Hong Kong and
Japan, as well as Campbell's Godiva Chocolatier subsidiary,
which had been part of Campbell North America. Mr. Subin, 53,
had been president of Campbell Latin America/Asia.
   The company said the objectives of creating the North and
South America division included taking better advantage of an
emerging North American trading bloc, bringing the Argentine
operation closer organizationally to the North American
businesses, developing Campbell's Hispanic businesses and
improving export opportunities throughout the Americas.
   The Europe/Asia division is aimed at enabling businesses
there to draw on Campbell's North American resources,
streamlining the international management structure and
extending core businesses to the global marketplace.
