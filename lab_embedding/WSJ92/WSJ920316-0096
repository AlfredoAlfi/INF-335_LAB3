Where Parents Can Go For Help
Parents' "first reaction often is that they're scared,"
says Rose Dinolfo, who is active in the White Plains, N.Y.,
chapter of Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. Parents
sometimes shy away from support services because "they are
dealing with their own guilt" over how life turned out for
their children, she says.
   Support groups for fathers are rare. "The fathers have not
shown too much interest in having a group. Maybe it's the
macho image they're supposed to have," says Beverly Ritter,
who took care of her sick daughter and now coordinates a
mothers' group in New York City.
   But a growing number of areas are responding to the need.
For information about organizations that offer support groups
in various areas of the country, call the National AIDS
Clearing House (800) 458-5231 or the National AIDS Hotline
(800) 342-2437.
