Suit Over Laser Arms
   Self-Chilled Can Scam
   Is Settled for $152,500
Shearson, which acquired defendant E.F. Hutton  Co., will
pay $92,500 and Wien Securities Inc., Jersey City, N.J., will
pay $60,000. Marshall Zolp, the mastermind of the scheme,
sold the Laser shares through Hutton. Wien was a market-maker
in the stock. A spokesman for Shearson, an American Express
Co. unit, said it settled to put to rest a matter "involving
Hutton that took place a long time ago." Stephen Wien said
his firm settled to avoid excessive legal fees. Mr. Zolp,
convicted of criminal charges in the case, served nearly two
years in prison and had nearly $600,000 in assets seized by
the SEC.
   The lead plaintiff's attorney in the class action, Daniel
Krasner of New York, said he was upset by U.S. District Judge
Milton Pollack's decision not to reimburse the plaintiff's
lawyers $40,000 for costs related to the litigation. He said
his firm wouldn't distribute the settlement funds to the
members of the class unless the costs of the distribution
were covered.
