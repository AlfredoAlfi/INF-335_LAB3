Business Brief -- Sequent Computer Systems Inc.:
   Concern Says New Products
   Aid Its 4th-Quarter Forecast
Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman, said the company's
results have been helped by several new products, which help
link the company's "server" computers to both mainframes and
personal computers. The products, which began shipping late
last year, will be officially unveiled on Monday.
   Separately, Sequent said it abandoned plans to build
computer systems based on reduced-instruction-set-computing
chips and will stick with systems based on processors from
Intel Corp., Sequent's longtime supplier.
   The news is a boost for Intel, which is battling MIPS
Computer Systems Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc. and others for
leadership in advanced microprocessors.
