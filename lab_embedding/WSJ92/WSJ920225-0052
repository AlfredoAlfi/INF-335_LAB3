Business Brief -- Cosmo Securities Co.:
   Settlement of $322.1 Million
   To Be Paid to Skylark Co.
A Cosmo spokesman said that one manager at the firm's
Tokyo office sold zerocoupon bonds to Skylark in July 1991
for a price of 40.8 billion yen, or about 10 times their
actual market value. The manager promised that the bonds
would be bought back in December with a profit of 2 billion
yen, the spokesman said. The promise was made in an attempt
to cover unrelated investment loses the manager had incurred
in other securities investments. But he failed to find
another buyer for the 30-year U.S. bonds, the spokesman said.
