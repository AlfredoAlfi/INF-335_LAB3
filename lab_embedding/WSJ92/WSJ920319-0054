GM Found Liable by Jury
Although the Corvette's roof met federal safety
guidelines, the jury found GM 80% responsible for Mr.
Smothers's injuries. Accordingly, GM is liable for $5.5
million of the award. The other driver is responsible for the
remainder.
   Yesterday, GM officials said that the Corvette's roof
wasn't defectively designed and that they will appeal the
jury's decision.
