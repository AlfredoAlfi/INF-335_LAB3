ABC News Executive
   Sherrie Rollins Picked
   For White House Post
Since assuming his post last month, Mr. Skinner has
emphasized improved communications as a key to restoring Mr.
Bush's political standing. But his choice for a new
communications czar, veteran Republican operative James Lake,
declined the position because he was unwilling to sever his
private business ties.
   Ms. Rollins was deputy communications director for Ronald
Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, and later was an aide to
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp before joining ABC. Her husband
headed the National Republican Congressional Committee until
he broke with the administration over Mr. Bush's support for
tax increases in the 1990 deficit-reduction agreement with
Congress.
   "I'm very pleased that she could overcome the disadvantage
of being my wife," Mr. Rollins said.
