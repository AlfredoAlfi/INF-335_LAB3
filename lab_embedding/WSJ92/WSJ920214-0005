Who's News:
   Alliance Capital Gets
   Four Top Specialists
   Who Leave Hyperion
Last month, Clinton J. Kendrick resigned as chief
executive and a portfolio manager after more than two years
with Hyperion. Mr. Kendrick previously had been president of
Alliance Capital, which oversees some $60 billion in assets
for institutional and individual investors. Alliance already
invests in the area of mortgage-backed securities, though it
has been much less a force in the business than Hyperion.
   A spokeswoman for Hyperion said last night that a
replacement for Mr. Kendrick had been selected, and that the
announcement of the new chief executive, and other
appointments for the firm, would be made shortly. In the
meantime, Mr. Ranieri has undertaken "direct management of
Hyperion Capital and its portfolios," the firm said in a
statement.
   Alliance Capital said it named two of the former Hyperion
managers to be senior vice presidents. They are Robert W.
Kopprasch and Patricia J. Young, both of whom were managing
directors and portfolio managers with Hyperion.
   Paul A. Ullman, a director and portfolio manager at
Hyperion, and George M. Dowd, a Hyperion vice president, were
named vice presidents of Alliance Capital.
