Business Brief -- Isosceles PLC:
   Herman's Sporting Goods
   Actively Searches for Buyer
A spokesman said the chain posted a loss on sales of about
$600 million in the year ending April 1991, and should break
even on the same amount of revenue this year.
   Herman's, started in 1932 in New York, sells hunting,
fishing and sporting goods and apparel in 260 stores
throughout the Northeast, Midwest and mid-Atlantic states.
Like many such midsized stores, Herman's has suffered effects
of a rough retail environment and heavy competition from
sporting goods "megastores."
   A spokesman at Wasserstein Perella said the retail
environment and condition of the chain had kept the owners
from aggressively hunting a buyer. Since then, the chain has
made management changes, remodelled stores and opened them in
new locations.
