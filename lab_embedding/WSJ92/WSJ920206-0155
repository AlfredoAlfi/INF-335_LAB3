International:
   J.P. Morgan Is Said
   To Expand Its Credit
   To Saudi Arabian Oil
The deal is split into a $1.5 billion general purpose
credit and a new $900 million loan for the tankers, bankers
said.
   Terms and conditions weren't immediately available.
   As reported, Morgan was mandated by Saudi Aramco last year
to arrange a $1.5 billion general purpose loan, but the deal
was postponed after Kuwait decided to proceed with a $5.5
billion credit to finance postwar reconstruction.
