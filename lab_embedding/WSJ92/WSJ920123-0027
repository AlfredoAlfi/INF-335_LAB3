Business Brief -- Houghton Mifflin Co.:
   Publishing House Says Loss
   Narrowed in Fourth Quarter
Houghton Mifflin, which publishes general-interest books
and textbooks, generally reports a loss in the fourth quarter
because of the seasonal nature of its business. Sales climbed
in the latest period to $78.4 million from $76.6 million a
year earlier. The increase was sparked by a sharp sales gain
at its Riverside Publishing Co. unit, which provides
educational testing services.
   For the full year, net income rose 39% to $25.1 million,
or $1.75 a share, from $18 million, or $1.27 a share, in
1990. Results for both years included nonrecurring items.
Sales in 1991 rose 11% to $466.8 million from $421.6 million.
