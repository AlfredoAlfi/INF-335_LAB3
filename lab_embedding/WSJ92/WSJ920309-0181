Prosecutors Charge
   4 Japanese Executives
   Over Arranging Loans
Prosecutors said that Hiroyasu Watanabe, former president
of Tokyo Sagawa, and Yasuo Matsuzawa, president of Heiwado
Co., were charged with breach of trust. The executives
allegedly caused financial damage to the delivery company by
having it guarantee $140 million in loans to Heiwado, a
medical-supply and real estate concern.
   The prosecutors said the loan guarantee violated
commercial law because the two men knew that Heiwado,
overburdened with debt, would be unable to repay the loan.
   Also charged with breach of trust were Jun Saotome, a
former managing director of Tokyo Sagawa, and Michio Ouchi,
an employee of Ichihara Kanko Kaihatsu, a resort-development
company, for arranging to guarantee a $307 million loan.
   The four have been in custody since they were arrested
last month. None could be reached for comment.
   Tokyo Sagawa is owned 30% by Sagawa Kyubin KK, a closely
held company that is the center of a nationwide group of
delivery companies. Tokyo Sagawa is reported to have made or
guaranteed loans of about 100 billion yen ($757.7 million) to
companies closely tied to a major gangster organization.
Japanese media reports also have alleged that the company
donated billions of yen to more than 100 politicians in the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party and in opposition parties.
