International:
   Ex-Soviet Exporters Kept
   Cash Abroad, Group Says
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The amount of money the institute estimates the former
Soviet Union lost in capital flight last year is about equal
to the $19 billion Russia is seeking from the U.S. and its
rich allies for economic reform this year.
   As the political situation in the former Soviet Union
deteriorated, the state-owned companies increasingly refused
to turn over money earned on exports to the central
government, instead stashing it away abroad.
   The Soviet government was using ruble exchange rates that
averaged 1.7 ruble for a U.S. dollar when the commercial rate
was over 100 rubles to the dollar, the report said.
   New policies and conditions may cut in half this "capital
flight" from former Soviet states this year, but obstacles
remain, says the report by the Institute of International
Finance.
