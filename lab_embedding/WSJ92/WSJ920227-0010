Rehabilitator Seeks
   Merger or Investment
   In Mutual Benefit
Such a plan would likely involve putting Mutual Benefit's
remaining assets and operations, including its life insurance
and pension businesses, in a stock-owned subsidiary.
   Mutual Benefit's life insurance business had $3 billion in
individual life insurance policies as of July 16, 1991, while
its pension business had $5 billion in assets.
   Mr. Palmieri declined to name any of the companies he has
contacted. He also declined to comment on whether he had
approached CNA Financial Corp. after reports that Mutual
Benefit was talking with the Chicago insurer about a sale of
its life insurance business.
   A CNA spokesman said there are no "substantive
discussions" with Mutual Benefit under way at the moment,
although the insurer said it had been contacted by Mr.
Palmieri. The spokesman said the company had shown interest
in the company's group health business when it was being sold
last year.
   It's unclear how much interest a merger or investment in
Mutual Benefit will generate, however. Such a plan would
likely involve taking on the assets of Mutual Benefit,
including its huge, troubled real estate portfolio, Mr.
Palmieri said.
