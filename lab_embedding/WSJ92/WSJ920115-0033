Business Brief -- Electrosource Inc.:
   Firm Expects to Complete
   Sale of Stock to Partnership
Electrosource said its board has already approved the
transaction and is expected to take actions necessary to
issue the preferred stock later this week.
   The development company, which does research on batteries,
suspended operations in September after a General Motors
Corp. subsidiary stopped supporting its efforts to develop an
experimental battery for electric cars. The troubled company
announced the preferred stock sale last month after the
failure of its efforts to merge with a private company, whose
identity was never disclosed.
