International:
   Four Former Advisers
   To Blue Arrow PLC
   Get Suspended Terms
When the rights offering expired, prosecutors said, the
defendants failed to announce that shareholders had purchased
less than 40% of the issue-news that might have sent the
price of Blue Arrow's shares tumbling. Instead, they
conspired to support Blue Arrow's stock price by having their
employers excercise enough rights from the offering to bring
the overall acceptance rate up to just under 50%, prosecutors
said.
   Three of the four convicted men, Jonathan Cohen, David
Reed and Nicholas Wells, were senior executives with County
NatWest, the investment arm of National Westminster Bank PLC.
The fourth, Martin Gibbs, was a director with the stock
brokerage firm, UBS Phillips  Drew.
   A fifth defendant, Christopher Stainforth, was acquitted.
During the trial, charges were also dropped, because of
insufficient evidence, against County NatWest, NatWest
Investment Bank and Phillips  Drew, as well as two other
individuals.
   Britain's Serious Fraud Office has said it may bring four
more people to trial in connection with the case, but no
decision has been made.
