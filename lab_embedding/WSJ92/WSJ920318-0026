Horsham Faces Suit
   By AOC Over Price
   Of Clark Oil Offering
"We firmly believe the lawsuit has no merit. There's no
conceivable reason why Clark would want to undervalue its
stock," said Paul Melnuk, president and chief operating
officer of Clark and of Horsham.
   Clark plans to issue seven million shares, or about 25% of
the total outstanding, at between $14 and $16 each. This
would value the whole company in the range of $392 million to
$448 million. Goldman, Sachs  Co. is the lead underwriter
for the planned offering.
   AOC didn't specify what it believes would be an
appropriate value for Clark. In its complaint, filed in
Delaware Chancery Court, AOC said an "exhaustive valuation"
by another consulting group concluded that Clark "had an
equity value substantially in excess" of the amount suggested
by Goldman Sachs.
   Messrs. Novelly and Goldstein couldn't be reached for
comment.
