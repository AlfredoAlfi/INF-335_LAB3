   Will Be Indresco Chief
In addition, Dresser said that Yazan N. Sharif, currently
president of its HarbisonWalker Refractories division, will
become president and chief operating officer of Indresco. Mr.
Sharif is 48.
   Dresser, one of the nation's largest oilservice and
equipment companies, has proposed spinning off to its
shareholders its industrial and mining equipment divisions,
which have been struggling for some time.
   The businesses to be transferred include refractory
operations, mining equipment, draglines and power shovels,
industrial tools, air-compressor operations in France, a 50%
interest in a construction equipment operation in South
Africa, and the 50% interest in the Komatsu-Dresser
construction equipment joint venture.
   Dresser said the Indresco operations had 1991 sales of
about $1.1 billion.
