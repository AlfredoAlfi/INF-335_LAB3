Business Brief -- ChipSoft Inc.:
   Company Settles Charges
   Over Software Advertising
But thousands of purchasers instead received a
stripped-down version of Norton, missing certain features
such as a disk editor and some operating manuals.
   In the settlement, ChipSoft took what Mr. Harshbarger
called "very responsible steps" to redress the alleged
misrepresentation.
   ChipSoft said it sent full versions of Norton free of
charge to everyone who complained, informed new buyers about
the lack of features on the version offered and modified
advertising to reflect that it was a stripped-down version of
Norton being offered. ChipSoft said it took the actions
before being contacted by the attorney general and called the
original advertising "unintentional."
