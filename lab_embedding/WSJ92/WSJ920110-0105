BP and Japan's C. Itoh
   Plan to Build Refinery
   On Indonesian Island
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The two companies estimate the cost of the project at $1.5
billion, which they will provide in the form of the capital
of the project company.
   The refinery will be wholly owned by a project company, in
which Itoh and BP will each hold 50% of the shares, the
spokesman said, adding that neither the Indonesian government
nor the state oil company Pertamina will participate.
   Pertamina had originally planned the refinery with Itoh
and BP as partners, but handed it over to two foreign
concerns in line with the government's decision last year to
cut back foreign borrowing, the spokesman said.
