Kaufman  Broad
   Net Rises Fourfold
   For Its 4th Quarter
Revenue fell 15% to $317.8 million from $375.2 million,
mainly because of lower commercial revenue in France, the
company said.
   Bruce Karatz, president and chief executive officer, said
a high volume of new home sales and improved margins in the
company's California housing operations more than offset a
decline in French housing and commercial development
activities.
   For the year, profit fell 34% to $26.5 million, or 80
cents a share, from $39.9 million, or $1.25 a share. Revenue
declined 11% to $1.22 billion from $1.37 billion.
   Mr. Karatz said the company's full year results reflected
the difficult market conditions prevailing in the real estate
business. The company continues to operate cautiously given
persistent uncertainty in the economic conditions prevailing
in both California and France, he said.
   Despite these pressures, Mr. Karatz said Kaufman  Broad
management anticipates an improvement in profit this year
through increasing its share of the California housing
market.
   Kaufman  Broad shares were quoted at $18.125, up 25
