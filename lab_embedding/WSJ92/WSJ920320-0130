Scholastic Corp. Says
   Profit Increased 41%
   In Fiscal 3rd Quarter
In the nine months, net rose 9% to $8.3 million, or 77
cents a share, from $7.7 million, or 72 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 15.4% to $347.6 million from $301.2
million. The recent period included a $4.1 million pretax
charge for its planned relocation of New York headquarters
and the 1991 period included a $1 million pretax charge in
connection with withdrawing an initial public offering in the
fall of 1990. Its second attempt was successful; it completed
a public offering last month of 4.3 million shares, raising
$89.3 million.
   Scholastic said revenue growth was strong in domestic book
publishing and international operations, but said lower
selling prices and higher promotion costs hurt margins in its
Australian and Canadian units.
