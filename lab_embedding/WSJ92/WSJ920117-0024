Anglo American Says
   Gold Mines' Profit
   Rose 15% in Quarter
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Anglo's Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd., the
world's largest mine, known as Freegold, had 6.4% higher
profit after tax and capital expenditure at 73.2 million rand
($26 million, converted at the commercial rate) in the fourth
quarter, compared with 68.8 million rand in the third period.
   But violence at one of the Freegold mine sites took the
lives of 52 miners and cost the company an estimated 13
million rand during the fourth quarter. Battles broke out
when workers supporting a nationwide general strike tried to
stop other miners from reporting for duty.
   Commenting on the fourth-quarter results, gold division
chairman Clem Sunter said Anglo American will continue to cut
costs and increase production.
   He said combined voluntary and compulsory retrenchments in
1991, which totaled 6,442 miners, indicated Anglo American's
commitment to reducing costs.
   Mr. Sunter said low interest rates in the U.S. improved
the outlook for gold as an investment.
   Anglo American will continue hedging its gold, using
options and forward sales, Mr. Sunter said. But he said Anglo
American was "being cautious" in its hedging activities
because "the market was relatively thin."
