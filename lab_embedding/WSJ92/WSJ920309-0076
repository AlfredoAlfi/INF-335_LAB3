Los Angeles Drafts a Plan
   To Trade Pollution Credits
"We've decided to harness the entrepreneurial spirit of
our business community to clean up the air," said Henry
Wedaa, South Coast Air Quality Management District chairman.
"Businesses will be able to reduce pollution where it is
least expensive, rather than having to reduce it where and
when they are told to by regulators.
   The "smog exchange" would allow companies to trade permits
that have a certain value in pounds of pollutants. If a
company cuts emissions beyond the clean-air goals, it can
sell its remaining pollution credits to firms that don't.
   A final vote is needed before the market can open for
trading in 1994.
