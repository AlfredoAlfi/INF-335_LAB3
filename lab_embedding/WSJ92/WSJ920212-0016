Blacks Urged by NAACP
   To Buy American Cars
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
While lauding recent steps Toyota Motor Corp. has taken to
boost the number of blacks in its employee and dealership
ranks, Dr. Hooks lambasted the others. "Most of them have
abysmal records," he said.
   In 1991, African-Americans owned 259 Big Three
dealerships, but only 11 such Japanese brand dealerships, Dr.
Hooks said. Eight of those were Toyota dealers, and three
were Honda Motor Co. dealers. By contrast, about 35% of cars
purchased by African-Americans are Japanese brands, which is
about the same as the national average.
   A Toyota spokeswoman said the auto maker recognizes Dr.
Hooks's initiative, and that the auto makers will continue to
work with the NAACP. But, "Asking consumers to buy a product
based on its nationality rather than value for the dollar and
quality of the workmanship involved is not in the best
interest of the consumer."
   Nissan Motor Corp. officials weren't available for
comment.
   Dr. Hooks said his call to buy Big Three cars is not Japan
bashing, "but simply a call for African-Americans to use
their dollars where it will benefit them the most."
