New York Agency
   Is Threatening to Sue
   2 Banks on Loan Ads
A refund anticipation loan is advanced by a bank in the
amount of an anticipated tax refund minus the tax preparer's
fee and the bank's fee. A tax preparer who files a consumer's
tax return electronically can help arrange the loan. The bank
collects the loan and its fee and pays the return preparer
when the Internal Revenue Service wires back the refund in
two to three weeks. Such loans permit taxpayers to have their
refund money in a matter of days.
   The department wrote to the two banks, saying it plans to
sue unless the situation is rectified. A spokeswoman for the
department said this is the first time banks have been cited
by the department for such actions, and that one other bank
is also under investigation for refund anticipation loan
practices.
   "We are in the process of answering their letter," said
John Russell, Banc One's vice president of corporate
communications. "Our lawyers think we are following the
letter of the law." Beneficial National officials couldn't be
reached for comment. Beneficial National Bank is a unit of
Beneficial Corp., a consumer finance company.
