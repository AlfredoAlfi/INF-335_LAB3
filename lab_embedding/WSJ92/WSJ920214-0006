Iowa Municipalities
   May Lose $74 Million
   In Wymer Fraud Case
The Iowa cities of Marshalltown, Webster, and Marion and
the counties of Scott, Webster, Black Hawk and Muscatine are
"most vulnerable" to having their general fund balances
"substantially reduced" if they don't get most of their
investment back, Moody's said.
   Mr. Wymer's money management firm, Institutional Treasury
Management Inc., Irvine, Calif., was seized by the Securities
and Exchange Commission in December. Mr. Wymer was charged
with defrauding cities and other governmental units of $113
million. He is expected to stand trial this summer on 30
felony counts of securities fraud, money laundering,
obstruction of justice and other charges.
   The SEC is currently conducting an audit to locate the
municipalities' money.
   Moody's said it has 41 ratings on the debt of 22
municipalities participating in the Iowa Trust pool. So far,
the general obligation bond rating of one only -- the city of
Marshalltown -- has been lowered as a result of its
investment with Mr. Wymer. On Feb. 4, Moody's lowered
Marshalltown's rating to A from double-A.
   Besides Iowa municipalities, cities and pension funds in
California and Colorado are also missing funds they have
invested with Mr. Wymer.
