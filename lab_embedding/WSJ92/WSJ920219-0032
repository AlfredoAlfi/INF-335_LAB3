Business Brief -- Turner Corp.:
   Venture Set to Be Formed
   With Karl Steiner Holding
Under the pact, Steiner would purchase $15 million of new
convertible securities in Turner, including $9 million of a
new class of preferred stock convertible into one million
Turner shares, and $6 million of fiveyear debentures
convertible into 600,000 Turner shares. The deal is subject
to a final pact and board approval.
   Alfred T. McNeill, chairman and chief executive officer of
Turner, said Steiner's investment will further strengthen
Turner's balance sheet. At the beginning of 1992, Turner had
a construction backlog of more than $4.7 billion in
contracts.
