Business Brief -- Piper Jaffray Inc.:
   Earnings More Than Tripled
   During Fiscal First Quarter
Piper attributed the quarter's record growth to the
"favorable investment climate in late 1991," in which other
brokerage concerns also have thrived.
   All three of Piper's core businesses, individual-investor
services, capital markets and investment-management services,
"continue to benefit from strong market activity and falling
interest rates," the company said.
   Additionally, following the fourth consecutive quarter in
which earnings surged more than 100%, Piper said it expects
to file a secondary offering of 2,175,000 common shares with
the Securities and Exchange Commission later this week. Piper
has 8.3 million shares outstanding.
   Under the planned offering, ITT Hartford Insurance Group
said it would sell all 1,852,902 of its Piper shares,
completing its "strategy" to shed the minority positions it
has held in securities firms. Harry C. Piper Estate Trust
also would sell a "significant portion" of its Piper shares.
