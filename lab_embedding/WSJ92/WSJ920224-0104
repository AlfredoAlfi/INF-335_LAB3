"There has never been a company that has gone into
rehabilitation with 50% of its assets in real estate during a
real estate recession," Mr. Palmieri said. The report was
filed in place of a formal rehabilitation plan. Although Mr.
Palmieri had earlier said he expected to file a
rehabilitation plan this month, he recently said that
schedule was set back to June while a group of insurance
companies review the insurer's financial condition.
   The report said the rehabilitation plan, when it is filed,
will likely give policyholders incentives to continue paying
premiums. For example, policyholders will likely be assessed
lower premiums and credited with higher interest rates.
Policyholders may also be offered a "bonus" at the end of the
rehabilitation period, depending on insurer's performance.
The report also hinted at possible cuts in interest rates for
some policyholders, however.
