Accountants Group Adopts
   New Deferred-Taxes Rule
Unlike the rule it replaces, the new deferred-tax rule
doesn't require companies to project in detail for company
units how certain tax changes will affect the companies'
balance sheets and earnings for decades. Instead, companies
can estimate how tax assets will be realized on their
consolidated balance sheets in the future. Such assets arise
from the difference between taxes reported to shareholders
and taxes actually paid.
   The new rule also allows companies to use future tax
credits to offset reductions in profits caused by setting up
reserves for retiree health-benefit costs. The previous
deferred-tax rule didn't allow such an offset.
