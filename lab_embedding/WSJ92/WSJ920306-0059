Money-Fund Assets
   Posted Sharp Decline
   In Most Recent Week
"Asset movements of money market funds continued the
pattern of the past few weeks," said Jacob Dreyer, the
institute's chief economist "The bulk of the overall asset
decline was concentrated among institutional funds. Some
institutional asset holders, highly sensitive to changes in
yield spreads among various investment vehicles, moved
massive amounts of money out of money-market funds and into
very short-term commercial paper.
   "But as the yields on longer-term instruments rose and the
yields on money-market funds slipped another notch,
individuals started extending maturities of their
portfolios," Mr. Dreyer added. "As a result, funds in the
general purpose and broker/dealer categories for the first
time this year experienced meaningful outflows of assets."
   Assets of money-market mutual funds for the week ended
Feb.26 were revised, to $512.9 billion from $512.86 billion,
and the increase was revised to $15.26 billion from $15.23
billion. The revisions reflect a change in the number of
funds reporting.
