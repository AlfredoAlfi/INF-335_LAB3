REVIEW  OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Clinton of Hippo
There is a force greater than any of this -- the voters.
Bill Clinton should tell the Democrats of New Hampshire that
when they vote next month, he explicitly wants them to
include these sexual rumors about his past in their
voting-booth calculations. And they should think about his
public-policy proposals. If the people of New Hampshire give
him the win in their presidential primary, then this matter
is behind him. An election is not the Final Judgment, but it
is the best arbiter that we mere mortals have yet devised.
