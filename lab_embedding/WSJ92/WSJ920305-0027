   Johnson  Johnson
   Settles Patent Suit
   Over Retin-A Use
Under terms of the settlement, Johnson  Johnson retains
exclusive ownership of the patent rights to Retin-A, but will
pay a royalty to University Patents and the university if the
Food and Drug Administration approves use of Retin-A for
retarding the effects of aging of the skin.
   The faculty member, Dr. Albert Kligman, developed Retin-A
20 years ago for use as a treatment for acne. In the course
of his treatments of patients, Dr. Kligman discovered that
Retin-A also helped retard skin aging. As a result, Retin-A
has been used by some people as an anti-aging treatment,
though the FDA doesn't allow its prescription for that use.
