Bush's Economic Proposals
   Draw Fire From Kemp
His criticism, made Saturday on CNN's "Evans and Novak"
program, was cited with approval yesterday on CBS's "Face the
Nation" by both Republican presidential candidate Patrick
Buchanan and James Carville, a top aide to Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton, a Democratic presidential candidate.
   "I've never liked tax credits," Mr. Kemp said in his CNN
interview. "Basically, those are gimmicks." Mr. Kemp didn't
say what tax credits he was referring to, but he is known to
have little enthusiasm for investment tax credits. Mr. Bush's
tax package includes a 15% investment tax allowance, which is
similar to an investment tax credit.
   Mr. Kemp also described as a "gimmick" changes in the
withholding tables that would allow people whose paycheck
withholdings for federal taxes are larger than necessary to
receive more takehome pay. "I cannot sit here on your show
and retain my credibility and say that allowing people
another $30 a month is going to spur economic recovery," Mr.
Kemp said. "It isn't."
