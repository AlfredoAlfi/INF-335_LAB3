Vishay to Post Drop
   In 4th-Period Profit
   Due to the Recession
The world-wide recession, especially in France, has
continued to hurt earnings, the company said. Additionally,
the fourth-quarter results have been negatively affected by
costs of about $1.5 million in Europe for work-force
reductions, as well as by additional manufacturing costs of
about $1 million in the U.S. as a result of production
problems that have been corrected, Vishay said.
   Vishay recently agreed definitively to buy the
tantalum-capacitor and thick-film network businesses of
Stamford, Conn., Sprague Technologies Inc. for $120 million.
These businesses have annual sales of about $220 million, and
are located in Sanford, Maine; Concord and Hudson, N.H.;
North Adams and Mansfield, Mass.; Toronto; and Tours, France.
   Vishay said it believes net income will improve if the
recession does not get any worse. The company cited cost
reductions, benefits from the merger and better market
penetration as a result of the size of the combined
organizations.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Vishay
shares fell $1 to $17.
