Sterling Optical Hearing
   Is Continued Until Today
The company at that time said it had agreed, subject to
court approval, to sell certain properties to American Vision
Centers Inc., an eyewear company.
   Sterling said that because results of the hearing are
uncertain, it had requested the New York Stock Exchange to
continue the suspension of trading in its stock.
   Other potential buyers have indicated interest in bidding
for some of Sterling's stores.
   The company blamed its filing on poor sales and the burden
of financing debt.
