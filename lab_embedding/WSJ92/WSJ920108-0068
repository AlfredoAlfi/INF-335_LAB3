Technology Brief -- Genentech Inc.:
   Revenue in '92 Is Expected
   To Be Flat at $515 Million
Mr. Raab cited an anticipated decline in sales of the
company's heart drug Activase to $185 million in 1992 from
$195 million in 1991. Sales of the company's other main
product, the dwarfism treatment Protropin, are expected to
grow less steeply than in the past as the market becomes
saturated and as juvenile patients complete their treatment,
a spokeswoman added.
   Nevertheless, Genentech said it will boost its rate of
research and development spending to $260 million, or 50% of
revenue, as it moves products out of the lab and into
clinical tests during 1992.
