   Peugeot Plans Job Cuts
The plant assembles 1,700 of Peugeot's 205, 405 and 605
cars every day.
   The spokesman said the job cuts, which won't entail any
layoffs, are in line with the company's strategy of steadily
improving productivity in the approach to the creation of a
single European market in less than a year's time.
