International:
   Daimler's Mercedes
   Confirms Plan to Cut
   1992 Car Production
"Mercedes-Benz confirms that the current planned
production for 1992 is under the previous year," the company
said in a statement. The statement didn't include any
specific production numbers.
   Mercedes said its passenger car deliveries to dealers and
distributors will be flat at about 560,000.
   The company painted a sober picture of the international
automobile market. "Mercedes planning is based on a clear
slowing in the automobile market," the company said. "The
special automobile market in Germany is over. In Western
Europe, the economy hasn't picked up speed, and vehicle sales
in the U.S. are unsatisfactory for all (car) manufacturers
because of the recession."
