Circle C Ranch Developer
   Settles With First Gibraltar
Bradley Development company said it also obtained $12
million to continue development at Circle C. The payment to
First Gibraltar will enable the development company to emerge
from bankruptcy-court protection, which it sought in October
1990 to prevent the thrift from foreclosing on Circle C.
   First Gibraltar said it was owed $130 million for the
Circle C development at the time of the bankruptcy filing.
The property was appraised at about $28 million, and the
thrift accepted that amount in settlement.
   Development of the subdivision had been stalled for almost
three years because of a dispute over First Gibraltar's
obligation to continue funding loans to Mr. Bradley's
development company, which had defaulted on payments.
   Complicating the dispute were government funds First
Gibraltar received to cover its losses on the Circle C loans.
Government-assistance agreements with First Gibraltar and
other Texas thrifts created in 1988 are being renegotiated by
the federal Resolution Trust Corp.
