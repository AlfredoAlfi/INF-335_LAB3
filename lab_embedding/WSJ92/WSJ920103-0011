   PRESS: The Daily Journal, New Jersey's oldest newspaper,
will close today after losing money for two years. "Over the
last two years, we've taken some stringent cost-reduction
measures, but in the end, the recession proved too stubborn,"
said Publisher Richard J. Vezza. Most of the 212-year-old
paper's 84 employees will be laid off. The closing is the
second in a year for North Jersey Newspapers Co., which in
April sold the assets of the Hudson Dispatch of Union City to
the competing Jersey Journal of Jersey City. The company also
owns the North Jersey Herald and News of Passaic. The Daily
Journal, based in Elizabeth, had a circulation of 30,000.
