Who's News:
   National Car Rental
   Elects GM's Murphy
   Chairman of Its Board
Mr. Murphy succeeds Vincent A. Wasik, 46, who resigned as
chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Wasik's departure
was by "mutual agreement" and he will remain a consultant to
National Car Rental, the company said. The post of chief
executive won't be filled. Mr. Wasik couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In addition, National Car Rental said it promoted Robert
J. McKenna, 55, to the positions of president and chief
operating officer, both titles also formerly held by Mr.
Wasik. Mr. McKenna has been the company's executive vice
president, operations, for the past five years.
   The car rental business has been depressed by the ailing
economy for more than a year, but Minneapolis-based National
Car Rental said its business had improved in recent months.
