Business Brief -- CAE Industries Ltd.:
   Sunnyvale, Calif., Operation
   Will Be Closed This Year
About 400 workers will lose their jobs when the Sunnyvale
plant closes, while 115 jobs will be added at Binghamton, the
company said.
   The company is consolidating the two operations to reduce
costs, a spokesman said. He said the plant closure won't lead
to a charge against earnings. The Sunnyvale plant makes radar
and visual simulation systems for the U.S. military.
