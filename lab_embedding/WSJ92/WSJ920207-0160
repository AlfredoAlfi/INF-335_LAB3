Westpac to Allot Shares
In trading yesterday on the Australian Stock Exchange,
Westpac shares rose four Australian cents to A$4.22.
   Australian regulations limit shareholdings in banks to
10%, unless the treasurer makes a concession, which he did in
the case of the strategic alliance. However, Treasurer John
Dawkins ruled yesterday that Westpac and AMP may hold
combined stakes of only as much as 10% in other banks. He
said the two organizations must reduce their combined
shareholdings in other banks within six months.
   Advance Bank Australia Ltd. had sought clarification on
the 10% limit in the case of Westpac and AMP. Earlier this
week, Advance Bank said the two have a combined shareholding
of 15.9% of its ordinary shares.
