International:
   Australian Bank to Cut Staff
Philip Levy, general manager for personnel, said
Commonwealth Bank wants to reduce staff in Victoria by an
additional 500 or 600 in the next seven months. The bank sent
letters to staff last week seeking responses for an early
retirement package.
   Other Australian banks have sharply reduced staff over the
past two years in an effort to raise efficiency and in the
face of dwindling profits during Australia's current
recession.
