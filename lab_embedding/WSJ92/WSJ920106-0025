   Britain Broadens Inquiry
   Into Maxwell's Dealings
Separately, Price Waterhouse, Maxwell Communication's
administrator under U.K. bankruptcy laws, said Jonathan
Phillips and Colin Bird, two partners in the firm's London

Communications Group, a Maxwell Communication subsidiary. The
appointments were made for "technical reasons," giving Price
Waterhouse fuller control of Maxwell Communication, the firm
said.
