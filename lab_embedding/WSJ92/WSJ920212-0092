   Tandycrafts Appoints
   Two Top Officials,
   Reconfigures Board
Roger A. Dickinson, 63, William H. Michero, 67, and John
A. Wilson, 70, retired from the board. Mr. Dickinson is a
professor of marketing at the University of Texas at
Arlington, and Messrs. Michero and Wilson are former
executives of the company. Carol Smith, 44, operations
manager of Tandycrafts' Joshua's Christian Stores unit, was
named to one of the vacancies. The company said Ms. Smith's
appointment reflects the fact that Tandycrafts' employee
stock ownership plan now holds about 43% of the company's
stock.
   The company also said Jerry L. Roy will resume the duties
of chief operating officer. In January, the company said that
office was being eliminated to streamline management.
