International:
   Japan's NEC, Fujitsu
   Lower Profit Forecasts
   For the Fiscal Year
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Fujitsu now is predicting parent pretax profit of 50
billion yen, down from the October forecast of 90 billion
yen, a Fujitsu spokeswoman said. Fujitsu posted pretax profit
of 127.26 billion yen in fiscal 1990.
   NEC sales are currently expected to reach 3.070 trillion
yen, down 3.2% from the earlier forecast of 3.170 trillion
yen but up 3.7% from fiscal 1990's 2.961 trillion yen.
   NEC trimmed its capital spending forecast for the current
fiscal year to 260 billion yen from the originally planned
270 billion yen. The 3.7% cut stems mainly from a decision to
delay the installation of semiconductor production lines, the
spokeswoman said.
   Fujitsu sales are seen totaling 2.450 trillion yen, 3.9%
lower than the earlier projection of 2.550 trillion yen, but
still representing an increase of 4.8% from 2.338 trillion
yen in fiscal 1990.
   Fujitsu also expects its capital investment to fall short
of the 220 billion yen originally planned, but hasn't made an
official revision, the Fujitsu spokeswoman said. Like NEC,
Fujitsu is cutting back on spending that had been earmarked
for expanding output of semiconductors, she said.
