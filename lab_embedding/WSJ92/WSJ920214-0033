First City of Texas
   Posts Narrower Loss
   For Fourth Quarter
To accommodate potential rescuers, First City said it
cleared up some impediments to a sale with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and other government authorities.
The company also made arrangements for potential acquirers to
review its books, and rescheduled its annual meeting to June
18 from Feb. 26.
   First City reported a loss of $35.8 million for the fourth
period after a provision for loan losses of $74.9 million.
The loss would have been substantially deeper if First City
hadn't liquidated its investment portfolio during the quarter
for a gain of $78.7 million. After accrual of a preferred
stock dividend, the loss was $42.5 million, or $2.25 a share.
   The loss represented a substantial improvement from the
year-earlier loss of $171.8 million, or $9.34 a share.
   For the year, the company had a loss of $224.8 million, or
$13.35 a share, after accrual of the preferred dividend,
compared with a loss of $158.3 million, or $9.87 a share
after accrual, a year earlier.
