Avery Expands Stock Buy-Back
The buy-backs would reduce equity in roughly equal
proportion to last year's debt reduction to keep debt, as a
percentage of equity, in the range of 35% to 40%, a company
spokesman said. The purchases will be funded out of excess
cash. Working capital needs have declined "significantly"
since Avery acquired a former rival in late 1990, he said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Avery shares closed at $25.625, down 50 cents.
