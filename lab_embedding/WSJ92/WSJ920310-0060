Business Brief -- WestAir Holding Inc.:
   Loss for the Fourth Quarter
   Narrowed as Revenue Fell
Revenue passenger miles in the quarter fell 29% to 110.1
million from 154.5 million in the year-ago quarter, while
load factor increased to 45.4% from 44.3%. A revenue
passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile; load
factor is the percentage of seats filled.

fourth-quarter performance won't affect its planned merger
with Mesa Airlines of Farmington, N.M. For the year, WestAir
posted net income of $6.5 million, or 99 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $12.3 million, or $1.86 a share,
in 1990. The year's revenue fell to $239.1 million from
$257.1 million in 1990.
