U.S. Healthcare Inc.
   Agrees on Rate Boost
   With New York State
Costas C. Nicolaides, executive vice president and chief
financial officer, estimated that close to 60% of the New
York HMO business would be covered by the increase.
   If the company doesn't file for adjustments in subsequent
quarters, he noted, the same dollar rates would apply to
other groups enrolling or renewing later in the year.
However, the percentage increase would vary somewhat because
of prices in effect during 1991.
   He added the company does intend to file to seek further
rate adjustments for its New York HMO business.
   U.S. Healthcare provides managed health care services
through health maintenance organizations in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, New York, Delaware, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire and Maryland.
