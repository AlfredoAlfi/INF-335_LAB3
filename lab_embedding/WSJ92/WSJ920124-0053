Business Brief -- Veba AG:
   Earnings in 1991 Were Flat
   Despite 10% Revenue Gain
Veba said strong revenue growth in its power,
petrochemical and trade-transportation-services divisions was
dented by a "considerable decline" in its chemicals
activities.
   The company didn't give a breakdown by division other than
to say revenue in the five states of the former East Germany
totaled three billion marks, primarily from business by
Stinnes AG and Raab Karcher AG, two trade and services units.
