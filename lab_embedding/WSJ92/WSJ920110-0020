International Brief -- Neste Oy:
   Finnish Oil Company Sets
   $750 Million Share Flotation
Details of the flotation, including timing and the size of
the holding to be sold, haven't yet been decided. However,
the sources said the initial sale is expected to involve less
than 50% of the firm's capital.
   Neste Oy, Finland's largest industrial company, is the
country's only oil refiner. In the past, it has relied
heavily on the Soviet Union for supplies of crude oil.
   It is the first Finnish state-owned company to appoint
banking advisers for a share flotation, following the
government's recent announcement that it intended to resume
privatization sales following a three-year lull.
