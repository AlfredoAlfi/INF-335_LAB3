Ruling Aims to Aid Owl
   In Timber Sale Guidelines
The bureau's current timber sale guidelines, known as the
Jamison strategy after the Bureau of Land Management's chief,
Cy Jamison, were formulated in 1990 with no input from the
Fish and Wildlife Service's owl experts. The court ruled that
the failure to consult with the service violated the
Endangered Species Act.
   The court ruling has no immediate impact because the
agency is already enjoined from selling timber in most of the
Pacific Northwest under a ruling in a separate case in
federal court in Portland. Nonetheless, it adds to a string
of court decisions in which federal judges have ruled that
the bureau and the Forest Service's timber opertions have
broken numerous federal environmental laws.
