   8.3% Rise in '91 Profit
   On Strengths at Unit
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Sales rose 9.4% to #2.98 billion from #2.72 billion.
   The results were slightly better than expected. Market
watchers had expected earnings of between #205 million to
#209 million.
   Robert Clarke, chairman, called the latest figures
"satisfactory." But he added that "there is no sign of an
upturn in our major markets on either side of the Atlantic."
Still, he said he expects the results to position the company
for further profit growth in 1992. He didn't elaborate.
   Despite the poor economic conditions in the U.K. and U.S.,
the company's largest biscuit unit, McVities, showed strong
results. Sales of McVities overseas more than doubled to
#217.9 million from #103.9 million. U.K. sales rose 7% to
#586.0 million. McVities' total sales rose 22% to #787.3
million, and profit advanced 18% to #106.7 million.
   The company's KP Foods division showed some signs of
weakness due to U.K. consumers moving to lower-cost products.
Sales in Britain advanced only 6% to #363.9 million. But this
modest setback was compensated by gains in Continental
Europe, where snack sales reached #140.4 million, up 42%.
