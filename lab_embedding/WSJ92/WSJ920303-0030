American Airlines to Raise
   Its Excursion Fares by 2%
A spokesman for AMR said the airline doesn't believe
demand for air travel is strong enough to push through the
broader fare increase. "We had to look at what the market
would bear, and we think the 2% excursion fare will probably
make it, but 2% on the business side would be a mistake," he
said.
   The industry has been plagued by low traffic for the past
year because of the Gulf War and the recession, and airlines
are finding that passengers are extremely price sensitive.
