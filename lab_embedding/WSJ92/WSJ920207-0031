Business Brief -- American Telephone  Telegraph:
   Fiber-Optic Cable Planned
   For Link to South Korea
The cable, which will be the first direct link between
Korea and Guam, will also integrate Korea with a
trans-Pacific cable network that will link Japan, Guam,
Hawaii and the U.S. mainland. The network is expected to
begin operating in 1995.
   Al Stark, senior vice president of ATT's international
operations division, said "the new cable system will play a
large role in speeding up the delivery of new and improved
services to all of our customers." Plans call for the cable
to have a capacity to handle about 80,000 simultaneous phone
calls.
