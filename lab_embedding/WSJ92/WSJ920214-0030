Business Brief -- Alexander  Alexander Services:
   Loss for the Fourth Quarter
   Of $35.2 Million Is Posted
The recent quarter's charges totaled $75.6 million, or
$1.18 a share, for restructuring of insurance brokerage
operations and other expenses. Year-earlier results included
a gain of 21 cents a share from settlement of some pension
obligations in Britain, offset by a charge of 15 cents a
share primarily for consolidation of global retail brokerage
operations.
   T.H. Irvin, chairman and chief executive officer, cited
the economy and weak pricing in the insurance market for
lower operating results. Nevertheless, management consulting
did better, despite recession-induced curbs on discretionary
spending by many companies.
   For the year, the company had a loss of $12.6 million, or
31 cents a share, compared with net of $54.9 million, or
$1.35 a share, in 1990. Revenue was up 2% to $1.37 billion.
In addition to the quarterly charge, 1991 results included a
charge of $2.2 million, or six cents a share, for an
accounting change related to deferred compensation costs.
