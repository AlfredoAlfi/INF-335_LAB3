Spain's Inflation Rate Rises
The underlying inflation rate is calculated on the
consumer price index provided by the national statistics
institute.
   The increase was due largely to rising service-sector
prices, which rose 9.9% in 1991, the ministry said.
   The institute reported consumer prices rose 0.1% in
December from November, bringing year-to-year inflation rate
to 5.5% from 5.7% in the previous month.
   The consumer price index stood at 178 in December,
compared with 177.9 in November and 168.6 in December 1990.
