Pakistan Drops Bond Sale
   That Touted Anonymity
Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) immediately branded the
advertisement as a pitch to drug-money launderers. He said
the State Bank of Pakistan was "as guilty of moving drugs
into the veins of the kids of this country as any
street-corner pusher."
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan also whipped
the Fed into action, dispatching examiners to U.S. branches
of Pakistani-owned banks. Richard Breeden, chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, commenced an
investigation, too.
   An official in Pakistan's embassy here said the sale was
off. Pakistan, he explained, inadvertently had begun
promoting the bond sale without first registering the
securities for sale in the U.S.
   The official denied that Pakistan had any intention of
seeking drug proceeds. Pakistan, he said, is merely seeking
to repatriate precious capital that had fled the country as a
result of the tight foreign-exchange control policies of
earlier regimes.
