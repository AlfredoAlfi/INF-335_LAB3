International Brief -- Akzo N.V.:
   Firm Plans to Streamline
   Its Management, Operations
Aarnout A. Loudon, chairman, said Akzo will merge its
headquarters staff with divisional managements, eliminating a
layer of management between the head office in Arnhem, the
Netherlands, and Akzo's approximately 40 subsidiaries. He
said job losses are inevitable but didn't estimate the total
number. A spokesman said around 1,000 people will be affected
by the reorganization; some will change duties or locations,
and others will lose their jobs.
   In 1991, Akzo cut its world-wide work force by nearly
5,000 people, or 7%, to a total of about 65,000.
   Mr. Loudon also said Akzo still expects to report that
1991 earnings before extraordinary items were "slightly"
below 1990's 716 million guilders ($421 million). The 1990
figure was down 26% from 967.6 million guilders in 1989.
   The reorganization will leave Akzo with four business
areas: chemicals, coatings, fibers and pharmaceuticals.
