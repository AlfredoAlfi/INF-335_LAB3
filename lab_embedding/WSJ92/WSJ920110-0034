Who's News:
   Louis Harris Leaves Firm
   He Started to Begin Other
"For the past few years, I have had a desire to once again
have my own firm," the 71-year-old Mr. Harris said. Louis
Harris  Associates was acquired in 1969 by securities firm
Donaldson, Lufkin  Jenrette and by Gannett, based in
Arlington, Va., in 1975.
   Mr. Harris, who was chief executive officer of Louis
Harris  Associates, also cited new polling opportunities
brought on by the political upheavals overseas, such as the
opening of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
   Mr. Harris will serve as chairman of LH Research, while
Mr. Wagner, who until last year was president of New York
City's Board of Education, will be vice chairman. Mr. Wagner,
47, who had worked with Mr. Harris in the early '70s,
rejoined Louis Harris  Associates last year as executive
vice president.
   Gannett said it has named as Louis Harris  Associates'
new chief executive Humphrey Taylor, 57, who was chief
operating officer of the polling firm. He remains president
as well.
