Accountant Group Backs
   Non-Partnership Concerns
Most states currently require accounting firms to organize
as partnerships, which saddle individual partners with
maximum liability risk. Yesterday's vote sets the stage for
the profession to lobby state legislatures to let accountants
organize as general corporations, where exposure to risk is
more limited.
   Philip B. Chenok, institute president, said the vote
giving accounting firms the right "to organize in any form
permitted by state law or regulation will help to protect
individual partners from unwarranted legal liability." The
institute has 305,000 members; 92% of the more than 126,000
who voted approved the change.
   The members also voted to clarify an ethics rule that bans
them from volunteering confidential client information to
government agencies having jurisdiction over a client's
conduct. "The vote makes clear that a previous prohibition
still stands," an institute spokesman said.
