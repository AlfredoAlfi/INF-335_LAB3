Texas Family Drops Claim
   On German Art Treasures
Mr. Meador brought the works, including medieval
manuscripts and reliquaries, to Whitewright, Texas, where
they remained until 1990, when some heirs agreed to sell an
illustrated manuscript to a German cultural foundation. The
church sued the family in federal court in Dallas later that
year. A tentative settlement of the suit was reached in
January 1991.
   Specific terms of the settlement weren't provided, but
both sides said the Meador family will receive less than the
$3 million that they were to receive for the illustrated
manuscript. The accord also calls for the art and religious
works to be exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art before
returning to Germany.
   The settlement didn't resolve a preliminary ruling by the
Internal Revenue Service that the trove should have been
listed as part of Mr. Meador's estate. "In the event that
ruling becomes final, we fully expect to challenge it in
court," said Randal Mathis, a lawyer for the Meador family.
