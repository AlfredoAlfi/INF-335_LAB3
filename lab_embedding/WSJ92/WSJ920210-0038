Business Brief -- General Binding Corp.:
   Company Says It Expects
   Lower Earnings for Year
For the year, the maker of business machines and related
supplies said per-share earnings will fall below the year-ago
86 cents a share to between 78 cents a share and 82 cents a
share. Net income will be between $12.3 million and $13
million, compared with $13.7 million in 1990.
   General Binding said sales in its core business continued
to be hampered by world-wide economic softness. The company
said its expenses in the fourth quarter grew "marginally
faster than sales" led by the integration of VeloBind Inc.,
continuing investment in its telemarketing operations and the
doubling of research and development expenses to accelerate
the release of new products. General Binding completed the
$50 million acquisition of VeloBind November.
