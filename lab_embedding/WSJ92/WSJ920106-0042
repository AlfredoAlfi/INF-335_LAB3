Business Brief -- Michelin Group:
   Union at Uniroyal Goodrich
   Files Suit Charging Fraud
The suit accuses the company of joining in a scheme to use
assets of Uniroyal Inc. and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire "to enrich
themselves at the expense" of the union. It also alleges
violations of anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws.
   The suit says a plan to defraud workers began with a 1985
leveraged buy-out of Uniroyal and continued until its 1990
sale to Michelin Group of France. Among those named in the
lawsuit are Uniroyal, Michelin Group and Michelin North
America.
