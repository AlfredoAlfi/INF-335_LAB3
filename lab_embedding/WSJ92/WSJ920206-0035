Business Brief -- Berlitz International Inc.:
   Plan to Prevent Takeovers
   Is Adopted by Company
Berlitz said its "shareholder safeguard plan" provides
that through August 1993, any party who buys 20% or more of
the company's stock must have the board's approval to do so.
If the board doesn't approve the sale, a rights plan will be
triggered allowing all other holders to buy an additional
share for every one they hold at $1 a share.
