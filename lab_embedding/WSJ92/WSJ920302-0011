Trading Extended
   For Futures, Options
   On U.S. Dollar Indes
Trading begins at 7 p.m. EST, then breaks at 10 p.m. for
an hour and a half. After resuming at 11:30 p.m., trading
continues throughout the next day until 3 p.m. The exchange
is closed from 3 p.m. Friday to 7 p.m. Sunday.
   According to the Finex, it is the first futures exchange
to trade futures and futures options through open outcry --
rather than on computer terminal screens -- during Pacific,
European and American trading hours.
   Dollar Index options volume surged last year to nearly 1.5
million contracts from under 100,000 in 1990 as international
money managers sought to hedge their stock and bond
portfolios against the fluctuations of the dollar. Dollar
Index futures volume rose 27% to 715,000 contracts.
   The extended trading hours will allow traders to better
respond to overnight swings in the foreign exchange markets,
the Finex said. About 20 traders and brokers will be working
in the trading pits during the overnight sessions, said Peter
Burton, Finex director. About 100 work during the day.
Chicago Research  Trading Group Ltd. and Geldermann
Associate Partners will be market makers in the contracts to
provide liquidity during the overnight sessions, the Finex
said. They are currently the biggest arbitragers in the
Dollar Index futures and options trading during the day
session, Mr. Burton said.
