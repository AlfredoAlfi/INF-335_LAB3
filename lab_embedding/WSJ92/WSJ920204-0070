Business Brief -- Upjohn Co.:
   Quarterly Profit Rose 13%
   On 14% Increase in Sales
Upjohn attributed the increases to its cost-control
measures and the sales growth of several major products.
   World-wide sales of Upjohn's health care products rose 15%
in the fourth quarter and 14% for the year. However, Halcion
sales fell 1% last year and 23% during the fourth quarter.
Critics of the sleeping medication claim its users experience
a higher incidence of adverse reactions than users of other
drugs in its class.
   Separately, a group of Upjohn shareholders yesterday
charged that the company's top executives fraudulently
concealed information about Halcion, and demanded a special
meeting to elect new officers and directors.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New York,
seeks to represent all Upjohn shareholders as a class action.
   A spokesman for Upjohn said the company had not seen the
lawsuit and had no comment. But he added, "We are confident
that we have not committed any fraud."
