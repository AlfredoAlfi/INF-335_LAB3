Law:
   Corning, Dow Chemical
   Are Sued by an Investor
Dow Corning, owned 50-50 by Corning and Dow Chemical, said
last week that the implants are safe and that its studies
were extensive.
   The suit was filed in federal court in New York City by
Joseph Reiss, a Corning shareholder from New York. The suit
seeks to be made a class action on behalf of all Corning
shareholders who bought the stock between Jan. 13, 1989, and
Jan. 13, 1992. On Jan. 13, 1992, Corning's stock price fell
$10.625 to close at $68.375 a share after it was reported
that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced a
moratorium on the implants because of questions raised by the
internal Dow Corning documents.
   Corning and Dow Corning officials couldn't be reached for
comment. A spokeswoman for Dow Chemical said the company
couldn't comment because it hadn't seen the suit.
