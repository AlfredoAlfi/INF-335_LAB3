Business Brief -- Motorola Inc.:
   Firm Will Pay $15.1 Million
   To Settle Pricing Allegations
A spokesman for Motorola said that in reaching a
settlement with the U.S. attorney, Northern District of
Texas, the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics manufacturer did not
agree that a violation of law had occurred. However, in a
statement, Motorola expressed regret over the incident, which
occurred because "the system of internal controls in this
business unit was not as responsive as it should have been."
   In its statement, the U.S. attorney said the U.S. alleged,
and Motorola acknowledged, that its computer group failed to
disclose that it gave commercial customers more favorable
discounts than those given to the government.
