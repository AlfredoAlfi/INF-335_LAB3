   Posts a 40% Increase
   In 4th-Period Profit
Television advertisements featuring Wendy's plain-speaking
founder R. David Thomas continue to pack a punch. Wendy's
said company surveys show the "Dave Thomas" ads now have
higher consumer recognition than the popular "Where's the
beef?" ads that stopped running in 1984.
   Wendy's kept a lid on prices in 1991 while experiencing a
5% increase in average sales per company-owned restaurant.
Prices rose 0.5% for the year. They fell in the fourth
quarter, when Wendy's added two items to its Super Value
menu, which features items for 99 cents each.
   Analysts say the Wendy's formula for success is based, in
part, on its decision to promote size and taste in defiance
of the diet-and-fitness craze. In addition, Wendy's manages
to attract penny-pinching consumers with its Super Value Menu
while it reaps hefty profits with sales of more expensive
"specialty" sandwiches, such as Chicken Cordon Bleu. Said a
Wendy's spokesman: "Our ability to successfully sell products
at both ends of the price spectrum means we have the best of
both worlds."
