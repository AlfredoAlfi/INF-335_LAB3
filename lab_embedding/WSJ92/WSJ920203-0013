Business Brief -- Galactic Resources Ltd.:
   Debentures to Be Redeemed
   At Less Than Face Value
Peter Guest, president and chief executive officer of
Galactic, said it will offer to holders additional shares
that Galactic owns in various small gold mining companies,
and some cash to be raised by selling some of those
companies' shares.
   He said the total still will be less than the debentures'
face value, but that the offer will give more to their
holders than a "draconian bankruptcy." He said a
restructuring plan for the debentures will be completed by
Feb. 15.
   The debentures were issued by a wholly owned subsidiary,
Galactic Holdings Inc., but are fully guaranteed by the
parent.
   In trading on the American Stock Exchange Friday, Galactic
closed at 24 cents, up 6.25 cents.
