Business Brief -- Reynolds  Reynolds Co.:
   Period Net to Be Restated
   Due to Accounting Standard
Reynolds  Reynolds, based in Dayton, Ohio, is a supplier
of information processing systems, including business forms
and computer systems, to automotive, medical and general
business markets.
   The company said the restatement is being made due to
adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Accounting Standards No. 109, which concerns
accounting for income taxes.
   Reynolds  Reynolds also said it recently sold its
Australian forms business and is finalizing the divestiture
of its Australian computer business. The company had said
last year that the Australian market proved too small for the
two operations to be profitable. Reynolds  Reynolds said the
sale of the two units should increase pretax income by about
$3.5 million in fiscal 1992.
