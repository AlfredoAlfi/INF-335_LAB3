Spelling Shareholder
   Sues to Block Charter
   From Buying Shares
Charter, an oil firm based in Jacksonville, Fla., last
week offered nine-tenths of a Charter common share for each
share of Spelling it doesn't already own. Spelling has 33
million shares outstanding.
   In composite American Stock Exchange trading, Spelling
rose 50 cents to $6.375. Charter was unchanged at $7.375 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Charter is 53%-owned by American Financial Corp., a
Cincinnati holding company that separately holds 2.7% of
Spelling's common shares. American Financial is owned by
financier Carl H. Lindner, who is chairman of Spelling and
chairman, president and chief executive of Charter. His son,
S. Craig Lindner, is Spelling's chief executive officer.
   Charter, American Financial and Spelling were named in the
suit, which also seeks unspecified damages. Charter officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   In Los Angeles, officials of Spelling declined to comment
on the complaint.
