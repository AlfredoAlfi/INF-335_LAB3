Business Brief -- Degussa AG:
   German Firm's Pretax Profit
   Rose 5% in Its 1st Quarter
Degussa said that in the course of fiscal 1992, the
decline in parent-company earnings will slow because of
cost-cutting measures previously implemented. The company
warned, however, that the chemical industry's weakness will
have a negative effect on world-wide group results for fiscal
1992. But it sees good chances that demand for precious
metals will rise during 1992, firming the current soft
prices.
