   Appellate Court Reverses
   Judgment in Antitrust Suit
In reversing the lower court's decision, Prime said, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati
said a new trial is unnecessary because "the evidence
presented {was} insufficient to establish an antitrust
violation by Prime in any conceivable product market."
