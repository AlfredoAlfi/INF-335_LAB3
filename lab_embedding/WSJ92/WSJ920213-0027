International Brief -- La Rinascente S.p.A.:
   Retailer Plans to Reinforce
   Presence in Southern Italy
Mr. Tramontana said Rinascente will reinforce its
distribution network in the southern regions of Calabria and
Puglia and on the island of Sicily, areas where 64% of the
new jobs will be based.
   The restructuring in the south is centered on Rinascente's
Upim department store division. Eighteen Upim stores will be
converted into warehouses for other Rinascente stores,
including the upscale Rinascente retailer, home and garden
supply store Bricolage, electronic chain Trony, and Super
Store outlets. Five stores will be closed and 150 will be
remodeled.
   The group plans to open 100 new sales points in Italy,
primarily in the south.
   La Rinascente, Italy's largest retailer, is controlled by
the Fiat S.p.A. industrial group. It posted a consolidated
profit of 94.2 billion lire in 1990 and 19.1 billion lire in
the first half of 1991.
