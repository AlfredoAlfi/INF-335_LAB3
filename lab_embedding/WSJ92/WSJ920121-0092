Who's News:
   Bonneville Pacific
   Names Mower to Post
Last month, Bonneville filed for protection under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code after Portland General Corp.
wrote off its 46% interest, or $45 million, in Bonneville,
and withdrew its financial support. The developer and
operator of power plants has about $360 million in debt.
   Bonneville also said it will continue to employ Buccino 
Associates Inc., Chicago, as bankruptcy consultants.
