Avery Dennison Posts
   $17.7 Million Profit
   For the 4th Quarter
"Considering the weak world-wide economy, the increase in
sales and income from continuing operations was a significant
accomplishment," said Charles D. Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   It was the second consecutive quarter of improved
operating performance, signaling that the company's merger
strategy is working, a company spokesman said. Avery
International Corp. acquired Dennison Manufacturing Corp.,
Framingham, Mass., in a stock swap in October 1990.
   Mr. Miller said the company's U.S. office-products
business performed "exceptionally well" in the fourth
quarter, reflecting lower expenses and the sale or closure of
unprofitable Dennison-brand product lines. The roll materials
and films businesses also achieved improved sales and
profits, helping to more than offset a loss in the European
materials business.
   For all of 1991, profit jumped to $63 million, or $1.02 a
share, from $5.9 million, or 10 cents a share, after the
merger and restructuring costs. Sales slipped 1.5% to $2.55
billion from $2.59 billion. Sales from continuing operations
increased 3%, the company said.
