Mexico's Somex Bank
   Sold by Government;
   Price Is $848 Million
The rich prices sustained throughout the government's bank
auctions have largely been viewed as votes of confidence in
the Mexican economy and the potential for growth in the
financial-services industry. Only eight million Mexicans have
bank accounts in a country of about 82 million persons.
   Thus far, the Mexican government has raised about $9.3
billion from the auction of 12 of its 18 bank chains. The
auction price for Somex is the highest premium paid yet, as
measured by a multiple of book value. The remaining six banks
are relatively small in size and lack national coverage.
   The banks were nationalized in 1982 at the start of a debt
crisis as flight capital began rushing out of Mexico for
securer posts in the U.S. and Europe.
