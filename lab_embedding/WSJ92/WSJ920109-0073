International Brief -- British Steel PLC:
   Closing Plant in Scotland
   Means Loss of 1,220 Jobs
Earlier this week, British Steel said it was trimming 219
jobs from a 2,000-employee plant in north Wales by year's
end. British Steel hasn't yet set a final number on the
number of group wide job cuts planned. However, it has also
said it hopes to use outside contractors where possible to
cover some of the reduced staff jobs.
   In November, British Steel said pretax profit fell to #19
million ($35.8 million) in the first half from #309 million a
year earlier. In the period, 4,500 jobs were cut, nearly a
tenth of its work force then.
