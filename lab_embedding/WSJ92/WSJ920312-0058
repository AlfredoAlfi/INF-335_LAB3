Morgan Stanley Succeeds
   In Olympia  York Suit

   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
The disagreement concerns the timing of Olympia  York's
obligations to pay Morgan Stanley $240 million for the
building in Canary Wharf, the massive real estate project in
the London Docklands. Morgan Stanley claims Olympia  York
was obliged to pay the money last December, while Olympia 
York claims it has until June to raise the funds.
   A hearing before a high court judge is believed to be
weeks away.
   "Counsel has advised us that we should be successful in
the high court proceeding and we fully expect a favorable
ruling and to complete the transaction on or before June 30,
1992," said an Olympia  York spokesman. A Morgan Stanley
official declined comment.
   Olympia  York, which is owned by the Reichmann family of
Canada, has been struggling to lease the $5 billion Canary
Wharf project in the face of a severe recession in England.
Real estate observers were surprised Morgan Stanley chose to
litigate over the dispute since the securities firm is a
tenant in the project and has an ongoing business
relationship with Olympia  York.
