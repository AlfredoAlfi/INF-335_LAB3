Wheat Is Predicted
   To Hit $4.63 a Bushel
   On Impact of El Nino
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Torrential rain, believed to be the result of El Nino, is
affecting soybean and sunflower crops in Argentina. A major
exporter of grains and oilseeds, Argentina accounts for 9% of
the world's soybean crop, said Alec Gordon, editor of the
report. South American soybean stocks are low, especially in
Brazil, the report said.
   Meanwhile, South Africa's corn crop, normally the biggest
in Africa, is stricken by drought and is expected to be
halved to four million metric tons this season, grain traders
said. Instead of exporting corn, the nation will import it,
they say. The South African wheat crop also is damaged.
   The extent to which prices rise depends on the severity of
weather changes that El Nino causes, the report said. "The
critical time will be in July and August," when El Nino's
impact becomes clearer, it said.
   The opening of trade channels to the former Soviet Union
should boost grain demand, the report added. It estimates the
region will import 19 million metric tons of wheat in the
season ending in June, down from 14 million tons a year
earlier. Corn imports will rise to 12 million metric tons
from eight million, the EIU predicted.
