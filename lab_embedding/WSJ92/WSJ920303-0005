CalFed Thrift Unit
   Sues U.S. in Dispute
   Involving Good Will
The regulatory change "represents a fundamental breach,
frustration and abrogation of the acquisition agreements,"
according to the company's complaint.
   CalFed is hoping to duplicate a court of claims victory
won last month by Winstar Corp., in which a judge held that
thrifts may be entitled to compensation in such cases. Many
other beleaguered thrifts with suits pending are also
hopeful, including Glenfed Inc., a sometimes-rumored merger
partner of CalFed's.
   California Federal, the nation's fourth-largest thrift,
certainly needs all the capital it can muster. Last November,
the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered CalFed to inject the
unit with $375 million by June 30. In January, the OTS
determined that because of the phased-in goodwill
requirement, the unit failed to meet risk-based capital
requirements and ordered it to submit a capital restoration
plan to authorities. The thrift said it submitted a plan
yesterday, but declined to detail its contents.
