International:
   Bosch Unit Buys Stake
No financial details were disclosed.
   Bosch said the joint venture would mainly make parts for
heavy diesel-powered commercial vehicles.
   The two parent companies already have completed what Bosch
called "significant" development toward the electronically
controlled parts, which make the motor work more efficiently.
   Closely held Bosch, based near Stuttgart, is a world giant
in auto parts.
