Technology Brief -- Cray Computer Corp.:
   Shareholder Files Lawsuit
   Claiming Securities Violation
Cray said the plaintiff, whom it didn't name, "claims he
is a member of a class damaged by misrepresentation and
concealment of adverse material information during the period
from Sept. 25 through Dec. 23, relating to Cray Computer's
progress in development of the Cray-3 and to the status of
the order for the first Cray-3" placed by Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory.
   Late last month, Cray disclosed that Lawrence Livermore
had canceled its order for the first Cray-3 -- a computer
plagued by technical problems and delays -- and had ordered a
rival's product.
   Cray said the suit, filed in federal court in Denver,
doesn't seek a specific dollar amount in damages.
