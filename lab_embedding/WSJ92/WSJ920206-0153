International:
   LVMH Unit Says
   Its Operating Margins
   Were Stable for 1991
The increase in prices was in line with the company's
policy in recent years to widen margins, especially at the
upper end of the product range. Mr. de Pracomtal said price
increases will be more moderate in 1992.
   Sales in the U.S. slumped 20% last year, in line with the
general weakness of spirits sales there, but the decline was
less pronounced in Britain, another important market. Sales
in Germany were unexpectedly buoyant, rising 10%. Hennessy
also noted there had been a surprisingly strong upturn in
some major markets such as Japan at the end of the year.
   Sales volumes for 1991 fell 6%, reflecting the economic
recession in the U.S. and Britain. Gilles Hennessy, a member
of Hennessy's board, said sales volumes are expected to
recover in 1992
   Mr. de Pracomtal declined to give precise figures for
Hennessy's profit for the year, saying LVMH won't give out
its consolidated earnings until March. For 1990, Hennessy
contributed 2.3 billion francs, or 40% of the group's 5.7
billion francs in operating profit. Operating margin was 45%.
