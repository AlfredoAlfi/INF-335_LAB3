Business Brief -- Pyramid Technology Corp.:
   Loss of $18.5 Million Posted
   For Quarter Due to Charge
Pyramid, a maker of computer servers that link networks of
less-powerful machines, said its restructuring involves
laying off 170 employees, or 14% of its workforce, and
consolidating facilities. Richard H. Lussier, president and
chief executive officer, said these actions should cut annual
costs by $15 million to $20 million, and blamed its losses on
"continuing world-wide recession and the resultant reduction
in capital spending."
