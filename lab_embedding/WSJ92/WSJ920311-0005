Xyvision Inc. Unveils
   Debt-Swap Accord,
   Payment Deferment
"By eliminating almost $400,000 in annual interest
payments and deferring -- and possibly later eliminating --
an additional $200,000 in interest payments, we will, at
least partially improve our chances of continuing" a
turnaround program, he said.
   The transactions include swaps with investors holding
$6,340,000 face amount of 6% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2002. Under the terms of this agreement,
holders will exchange their debentures for unsecured
promissory notes and common shares.
   In the agreement with Saltzman, which owns about $3.6
million of debentures, the investor will defer until Sept. 30
the May interest payment. The electronic-publishing equipment
and software maker said it hopes to negotiate a swap with
Saltzman before the interest payment is due Sept. 30.
Saltzman also holds about 20% of the company's common shares
outstanding.
   The agreement requires approval of Xyvision stockholders
at the 1992 annual shareholders meeting.
   Xyvision called the transactions "important steps in a
program that is being put into effect by the company to
combat the significant losses and diminution of cash
resources during the prior three fiscal years."
