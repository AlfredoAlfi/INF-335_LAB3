Letters to the Editor:
   A Partnership to Tame
   Health-Care Monster
But more than that, the need today is for a true
public-private partnership to tame the health-care monster.
For an example, I would point to Medicare, which
national-health advocates routinely -- and misleadingly --
cite as an example of government administrative efficiency
and superiority over excessive private-sector overhead. The
truth, however, is just the opposite. In states such as Ohio,
it is private-insurance carriers that administer the massive
claims system -- and the private sector that deserves the
credit for administrative efficiency.
   Private carriers also pay taxes to support government
programs, and this is counted against their administrative
expenses. Another part is the cost of administering
cost-containment programs, which are vastly superior to
rationing health care by government budget appropriations. In
fact, we are just beginning to see how effective competition
and other free-market forces can be in fighting health-care
inflation.
