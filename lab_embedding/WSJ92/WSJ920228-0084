Marketing  Media:
   Financial World Magazine
   Cancels Seminar Offers
But Financial World took heat from several cities and the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, which criticized the seminars.
"Unfortunately, our effort to help cities improve management
by benchmarking was misperceived as a way to buy a grade, or
for Financial World to profit," Douglas McIntyre, president
of the privately held magazine, said in a statement. "The
gesture was aimed at helping cities."

cities and states. Financial World is owned by Mr. McIntyre
and a partnership that includes Carl Lindner's American
Financial Corp.
