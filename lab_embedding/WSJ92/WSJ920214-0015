Business Brief -- Fleet Call Inc.:
   Sale of 5.7% Stake Closed
   With a Matsushita Concern
The company had announced a preliminary agreement with
Matsushita Communication, a Matsushita Electric Industrial
Co. unit, in its prospectus detailing a scaled-down public
offering. Fleet Call initially intended to offer 11 million
shares at $18 to $20 each, but eventually sold 7.5 million
shares at $15 each. Matsushita was sold three million newly
issued shares at the same price.
   The company, one of the nation's largest operators of
specialized mobile radio systems, said it will use about $32
million to pay down its bank debt.
   Matsushita will hold a seat in Fleet Call's board, which
will be expanded to nine seats. Also, it will supply
subscriber equipment for the digital networks. Fleet Call
said the first network will be completed by August 1993.
