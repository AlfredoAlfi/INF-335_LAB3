Technology Brief -- Cadence Design Systems Inc.:
   Fourth-Period Loss Posted,
   Reflecting Valid Logic Deal
The year-ago figures were restated to combine the results
of Cadence and Valid Logic, a San Jose software concern that
merged with Cadence in December. Merger and restructuring
costs were $51.6 million, or $1.19 a share, Cadence said.
   The write-off was expected and Cadence's loss doesn't
reflect the health of its business, said securities analyst
Michael Stark of Robertson, Stephens  Co. "They've
restructured the company to be a pretty profitable entity,"
he said.
   For the year, the loss widened to $21.7 million, or 56
cents a share, from $6.1 million, or 18 cents a share, in
1990. Revenue rose to $392.3 million from $390.0 million.
