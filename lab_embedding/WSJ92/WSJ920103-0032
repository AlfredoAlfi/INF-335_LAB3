RTC Sale Pact Is Criticized
   By a House Subcommittee
The subcommittee staff, in its 74-page report, said it is
impossible to determine whether the RTC has received maximum
value for the properties. But it criticizes the agency for
negotiating a private transaction with the buyer and not
offering the same properties at the same terms to other
potential bidders.
   The report, done with the guidance of Rep. Frank Annunzio
(D., Ill.), chairman of the House Financial Institutions
Supervision, Regulation and Insurance Subcommittee, said the
RTC "must improve its demonstrably poor organizational
communications."
   An RTC spokeswoman, noting that the deal is being
structured as a pilot for possible future accords, called the
subcommittee study "a valuable exercise. We will closely look
at their comments and criticisms when closing the deal."
