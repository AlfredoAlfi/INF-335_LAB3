Renaissance Energy,
   Bombardier to Join
   Toronto Stock Index
Analysts said the share prices of Renaissance and
Bombardier could move up because 1,500 shares of Renaissance
Energy and 500 shares of Bombardier must be purchased by the
index custodian for inclusion in the exchange's Toronto 35
Index Participation Units.
   The units are baskets of shares that trade on the exchange
and that duplicate the Toronto 35 Index. They were designed
as a low-cost way of investing in a diversified stock
portfolio and as a tool for basket trading and hedging
strategies. A trust created by the exchange buys shares of
the 35 companies in the index, and investors then buy units
of the trust.
   Renaissance Energy is a Calgary oil and natural gas
concern. Bombardier, based in Montreal, is an aircraft and
industrial products manufacturing concern.
