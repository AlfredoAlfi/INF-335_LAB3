International Brief -- George Wimpey PLC:
   Pretax Loss of $27.5 Million
   Is Reported for Latest Year
The British construction company attributed the decline to
the drop of land and property values during the recession,
which led it to take an exceptional provision of #46.4
million. Without such provisions, Wimpey's pretax profit from
ordinary activities would have shown a 46% drop to #30.3
million from #56.1 million.
   Wimpey's results were in line with market expectations.
   The company said the unchanged dividend reflects its goal
of providing "a steady return to shareholders, despite the
peaks and troughs of economic cycles."
   Wimpey said that "during 1992 the group will continue to
focus on the rigorous management of costs and capital
spending, investing principally in homes and minerals
businesses, while tailoring investment judiciously to market
demand."
