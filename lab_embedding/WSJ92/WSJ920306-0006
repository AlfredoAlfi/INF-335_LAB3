Heineken's Net Profit
   Rose 21% for 1991,
   Boosted by a Gain
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Discounting the extraordinary gain, profit from ordinary
activities rose 12% to 409.7 million guilders.
   Heineken's results, announced after the close of trading,
took analysts by surprise. Market expectation had called for
Heineken's profit, including extraordinary gains, to increase
to about 410 million guilders.
   As a result, brokers are forecasting that Heineken will
open trading in Amsterdam today with a bang, with shares
moving immediately to a range of 170 guilders to 175
guilders. Heineken's shares closed yesterday at 166.60
guilders, down 3.30 guilders.
   "The sentiment was pretty negative for Heineken, and now
it will turnaround," said Victor Goossens, a broker with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Amsterdam.
   Heineken said it will keep its regular dividend payment in
1991 unchanged at 3.50 guilders. Discounting an interim
dividend of 1.50 guilders, this means the final cash payout
from the regular dividend will be two guilders.
   In addition to its regular dividend, Heineken said it will
propose issuing a bonus share for each four shares investors
hold. Also, Heineken said that it will pay out of its
revaluation reserves a cash dividend of 0.694 guilder for
each share investors held before the bonus issue.
   The last time Heineken gave out a bonus share to investors
was in 1989.
