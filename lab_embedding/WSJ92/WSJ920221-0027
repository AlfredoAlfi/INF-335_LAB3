Business Brief -- Cullum Cos. Inc.:
   Moody's Cuts Debt Ratings
   Of Operator of Texas Stores
Cullum operates grocery and drug stores in the Dallas-Fort
Worth, Texas, area, which has become increasingly competitive
in recent years as other chains have moved in. Moody's said
the company isn't under immediate cash pressure because the
discount debentures won't pay cash interest for two years.
But Moody's also added that "there is little likelihood of
improved operating results" given the competitive market.
   Cullum's senior subordinated notes previously were rated
single-B-2, and its discount debentures were rated
single-B-3.
   A Cullum official declined comment on the move.
