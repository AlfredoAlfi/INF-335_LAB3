Business Brief -- Revlon Inc.:
   Borghese and Halston Lines
   Are Sold to Saudi Investors
Marcella Borghese, one of Revlon's upscale brands of
cosmetics and fragrances, was rumored to be on the block
since early last year. The Revlon spokesman said it may still
sell some much smaller assets. No transactions are expected
in the near future, he said. Revlon is still debt-heavy after
its $2.7 billion leveraged buy-out in 1985, a Revlon
spokesman said. Revlon declined to release sales figures for
Borghese or Halston.
