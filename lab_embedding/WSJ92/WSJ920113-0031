Investments Made
   Across Borders Fell
   By 55% During 1991
Among the EC countries, Britain was the most popular
location for cross-border investments, which totaled $9.1
billion, followed by Spain with $3.1 billion and France with
$2.4 billion.
   France was the heavy hitter among investors, running away
from Japan in the number and value of cross-border purchases,
with 220 deals for a total value of $12.5 billion. Japanese
firms made 138 cross-border investments for a total value of
$3.92 billion. However, in 1990, both French and Japanese
investments were higher -- $16.71 billion and $18.64 billion,
respectively.
   The amount being invested dropped significantly from
previous years. American buyers spent $7.3 billion last year
in cross-border deals, less than half of what they spent in
1990. Further, KPMG Peat Marwick sees limited recovery for
the cross-border mergers and acquisitions market in 1992.
   But while the first quarter of 1991 showed the lowest
value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions for the year
at $9.7 billion, the last quarter of 1991 showed the highest
value at $15.1 billion.
