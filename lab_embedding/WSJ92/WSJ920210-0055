Business Brief -- Tucson Electric Power Co.:
   Adjustments by Regulators
   Led to 4th-Quarter Profit
A spokesman said the utility isn't making any money yet
and is "a long way from being profitable." He said the
fourth-quarter profit came from regulatory adjustments that
allowed the utility to defer various costs for the future.
Last month Tucson Electric avoided being forced into
involuntary bankruptcy by several creditors.
   For the year, Tucson Electric posted a loss of $457
million, or $18.10 per share, compared with a 1990 loss of
$387 million, or $15.50 a share.
   The fourth-quarter results reflected additions to income
totaling $83 million resulting from a rate order issued by
the Arizona Corporation Commission in October, Tucson
Electric said.
   The utility said $72 million of that amount came from
deferring for future recovery the operating costs of its
Springerville Unit 2 power station. The other $11 million
came from delaying for two years the pay out of gains from a
sale in the mid-1980s of transmission lines to rateholders.
