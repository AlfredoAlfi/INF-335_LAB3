   Increased Last Year

"In 1991, especially in the first half, the U.S. discount
rate fell at a fast pitch, and expectations of easier
monetary policy were quite strong," increasing the
attractiveness of U.S. securities, a Finance Ministry
official said. "Moreover, high-interest (U.S.)
mortgage-related bonds were attractive to Japanese
investors."
   For the same reasons, Japanese money managers predict the
ardor of Japanese investors toward the U.S. market will cool
this year as the U.S. economy recovers, pulling up interest
rates and depressing prices of debt. Later in the year, the
European market may prove attractive, the analysts say.
   Rallies in overseas stock markets, notably the U.S.,
already prompted Japanese investors to unload a record amount
of foreign shares in January. Japanese investors cashed in
their foreign investments by more than $3.22 billion in
January after net sales of $322 million in December, the
Finance Ministry said. A year earlier, there were net
investments of $2.7 billion in January and almost $2.5
billion in February.
