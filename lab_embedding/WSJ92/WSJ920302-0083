Gibson Pleads Innocent
   In Airline-Tickets Case
The indictment alleges that Mr. Gibson purchased full-fare
tickets for travel on American Air and then switched the
boarding passes to expired discount tickets. The full-fare
tickets were later submitted for refunds, according to the
indictment.
   Mr. Gibson, 47 years old, also was charged with one count
of defrauding American Federal Bank, the thrift unit of
Dallas-based Lone Star Technologies Inc. Mr. Gibson served as
president and chief executive officer of the thrift in 1988
and 1989. That charge relates to reimbursements for travel
expenses.
