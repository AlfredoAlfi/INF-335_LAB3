Technology Brief -- Integrated Device Technology Inc.:
   Third-Period Loss Expected;
   Layoffs Are Set, Pay Is Cut
The anticipated loss for the quarter ended Dec. 29
compares with profit of $256,000, or one cent a share, on
revenue of $48.2 million a year earlier. Revenue for the
period should grow 5% to more than $50 million. The company
said that although new orders were strong, it wasn't able to
ship enough product during the quarter to offset the high
costs of adding new manufacturing capacity.
   The cuts are expected to have a "positive impact" on
future quarters, the company said.
   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Integrated closed at
$6.375, up 12.5 cents.
