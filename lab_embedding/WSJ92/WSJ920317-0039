Business Brief -- Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.:
   Retailer Plans Consolidation
   Of All Its Store Functions
Since filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in February 1991, Carter
Hawley has taken several steps to streamline the company.
   Carter Hawley called the latest consolidation the "final
step in our program to simplify our organization." The
retailer said the moves, expected to be completed by
September, should save it about $25 million to $30 million
annually.
   As a result, as many as 300 employees will lose their
jobs, most of them in the 400-employee San Francisco
headquarters, a spokesman said.
