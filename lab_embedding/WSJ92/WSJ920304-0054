Mr. Gross said the payment covers $96 million awarded to
Honeywell by a federal jury early in February, interest, and
a license fee to sell cameras and other products that the
jury found to be based on Honeywell's patents.
   Honeywell agreed to drop its plans to seek a court order
barring the sales of Minolta cameras in the U.S., Mr. Gross
added. The agreement also covers the technology used in the
popular Maxxum camera made by Minolta, he said.
   Last night, Honeywell couldn't be reached for comment.
   Sam Kusumoto, chairman and chief executive officer of
Minolta's U.S. subsidiary, said: "Reaching a decision to
settle was not an easy one. However, we believe that
eliminating the distraction of prolonged litigation is in the
best interest of our 2,900 U.S. employees, as well as the
thousands of Minolta dealers and customers who have supported
us in this dispute."
