Business Brief -- McDonnell Douglas Corp.:
   Stock Price Rebounds a Bit
   After Wednesday's Decline
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
that disclosed the projected cash-flow deficit, the St.
Louis-based aircraft maker also said it expects to deliver
about 90 MD-80 commercial jets this year, down from 138
delivered last year. Previously, the company had said it
planned to deliver 100 planes this year.
   Some analysts blamed Wednesday's sharp drop as much on
short-sellers' continuing campaign to beat down McDonnell
Douglas shares as on the news itself. Shortsellers profit
when a stock falls because they can replace at lower prices
stock borrowed from other investors.
   "Short-sellers were circulating bits and pieces {of the
filing} through the fax machines, underlining and starring
the most negative facts," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at
Prudential Securities Inc.
