Business Brief -- Westinghouse Electric Corp.:
   Firm, Mitsubishi to Swap
   Nuclear Steam Technology
Under a previous agreement due to expire in 1996,
Mitsubishi licensed Westinghouse technology but Mitsubishi
wasn't allowed to build atomic power plants with its own
technology. Mitsubishi hailed the new agreement as "the
beginning of a new era of cooperation . . . as equal
partners."
   The two companies have been collaborating on nuclear
technology since 1958. Westinghouse, based in Pittsburgh, is
an electrical manufacturing concern with interests in
broadcasting, power generation equipment and financial
services.
