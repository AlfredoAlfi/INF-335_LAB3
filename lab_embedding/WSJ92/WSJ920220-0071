Technology:
   Hepatitis B Immunization
   Is Urged for Young People
The academy recommendations follow those made in November
by the Centers for Disease Control. A CDC committee called
then for universal infant immunization against hepatitis B,
the first time children would be vaccinated against a
sexually transmitted disease that primarily affects adults.
The recommendations aren't legally enforceable.
   The academy estimates between 200,000 and 300,000 acute
infections with the hepatitis B virus occur each year in the
U.S. The virus is transmitted through exposure to blood and
blood products, through sexual contact and from mothers to
infants, primarily during birth. Unlike many other sexually
transmitted diseases, hepatitis B is preventable by vaccine.
