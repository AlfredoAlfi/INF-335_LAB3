Who's News:
   Piccadilly Cafeterias'
   James C. Malmberg
   Leaves Three Posts
While Rodney Garrison, senior executive vice president,
termed Mr. Malmberg's resignation voluntary, he noted what he
called the company's "lack of recent success" in ending its
decline in earnings and customer traffic. In its fiscal first
quarter, ended Sept. 30, Piccadilly had a loss of three cents
a share, reversing a year-earlier profit of 27 cents a share;
and net income of 10 cents to 15 cents a share as projected
by analysts for its second quarter, which ended last Tuesday,
would fall well short of the 23 cents a share posted a year
earlier.
   "When earnings are not very good, there is always some
amount of pressure from shareholders," Mr. Garrison said. The
largest shareholder is Julia Hamilton, the 70-year-old
daughter of Piccadilly's founder, who holds 12% of the
company's common. Mr. Quick owns or controls about 9% of the
common.
   Mr. Quick said that Mr. Malmberg felt it was "time for new
leadership."
   Mr. Malmberg, a 34-year company veteran who had been chief
executive since 1984, didn't return phone calls seeking
comment.
