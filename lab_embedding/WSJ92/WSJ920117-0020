Business Brief -- U.S. Surgical Corp.:
   Rise in Net Income of 96%
   Reported for 4th Quarter
Chairman Leon C. Hirsch attributed the results to the
"explosive" growth of U.S. Surgical's new line of products
for laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, surgery, coupled
with continuing strength in its core surgical stapling
products. Earlier this year, the company introduced a new
stapler that allowed laparoscopic surgical techniques to be
used in hysterectomy, appendectomy and lung and bowel
procedures. Laparoscopic surgery allows operations to be
performed through tiny holes in the abdomen rather than wide
incisions, which reduces pain and recovery time.
   Despite the glowing results, U.S. Surgical shares dropped
$8 to $123.50 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. U.S. Surgical was among many health-care stocks sold
off by investors who suspected they were overvalued.
