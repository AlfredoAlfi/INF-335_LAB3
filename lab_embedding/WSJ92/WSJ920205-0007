Law:
   Texas School Tax Ruling
   Is Challenged by Taxpayer
"I want to try to get a refund for everybody. If that
means that the Legislature has to go back and do some more
work, that's why they all ran for office in the first place,"
Mr. Keahey said.
   The Supreme Court ruled the new county education district
(CED) property tax unconstitutional last Thursday. But
justices gave lawmakers until June 1, 1993, to adopt a new
school funding plan. The ruling followed a challenge by
property-rich school districts and some individual taxpayers.
   The court majority deferred the ruling's effect so that it
will not interfere with the collection of the CED property
taxes for 1991 and 1992. The 1991 taxes were due Friday, and
the 1992 taxes will be due in January of next year.
   The current school finance system, approved by lawmakers
last year, was designed to shift hundreds of millions of
local property tax dollars from richer to poorer school
districts within 188 CEDs, made up of one or several
counties. It was passed in response to previous Supreme Court
orders to equalize school funding.
