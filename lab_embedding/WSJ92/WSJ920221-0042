Business Brief -- Warnaco Group Inc.:
   Firm Planning New Issue
   To Help Reduce Its Debt
Warnaco sold six million common shares to the public in
October at $20 each. It used the proceeds to repay debt and
repurchase a portion of its preferred shares outstanding. In
late composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Warnaco stock was quoted at $32.25, unchanged.
   Warnaco has about $430 million remaining of the debt the
company incurred in the 1986 management-led leveraged buy-out
for $550 million.
   The company said that the refinancing would reduce the
interest rate on its debt to about 7% from 13% and would
result in annual interest savings of $28 million.
