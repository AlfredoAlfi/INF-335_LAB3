   Time Warner's Elektra Sets
   New Life for Asylum Label
Elektra, a division of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music
Group, had a Nashville operation years ago, but merged it
with Warner Record's country division in the early 1980s. But
country music is enjoying a resurgence at the moment,
claiming bigger and younger radio audiences than ever before,
as a new generation of young country stars becomes prominent.
Singer Garth Brooks recently became the first country artist
ever to have an album debut at No. 1 on Billboard's pop
chart, where he currently has two albums in the top five.
   All the major record companies have Nashville operations,
but they've been expanded and garnered greater clout and
bigger ad budgets recently.
   Mr. Lehning said Asylum will build slowly, producing just
two or three projects in the first year and building a small
roster of singer/songwriters.
