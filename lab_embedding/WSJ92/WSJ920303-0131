Ball Corp. Completes Purchase
The addition of the Kerr commercial glass business doesn't
include that company's home canning line. Ball-In-Con, a
unit, will now operate 16 glass container manufacturing
plants and one glass container mold production facility in 10
states with about 6,000 employees and will have annual sales
of $750 million.
