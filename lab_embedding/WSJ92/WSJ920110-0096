International:
   France Challenges
   EC, U.S. Agreement
   On Antitrust Law
Under the agreement, the U.S. and EC are to share
information in investigations involving multinational
companies. Deals involving major companies sometimes are
subject to separate EC and U.S. inquiries, occasionally
leading to contradictory results.
   It's unclear whether the French challenge has much chance
of succeeding. The challenge, filed last month, wasn't
publicly announced. A French official said a ruling is likely
within about two months.
   Even if the court does overturn the agreement, U.S. and EC
competition officials might be able to continue cooperating
on an informal basis, suggested Simon Polito, a Brussels
partner in the British law firm Lovell White Durrant.
   In any case, lawyers say the agreement marked only a
modest step toward harmony between U.S. and EC competition
law. They say there is little hope that it will lead in the
near term to "one-stop shopping" for companies seeking
approval for international mergers.
