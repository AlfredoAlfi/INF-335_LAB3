Business Brief -- Monsanto Co.:
   NutraSweet Subsidiary Sets
   Roll-Out of New Sweetener
NutraSweet, based in Deerfield, Ill., said it hopes the
new product will woo sugar users who are "careful about what
they eat, but aren't necessarily dieting." Packaged in a
glass jar, the product more closely resembles the real thing
than the company's Equal product, which comes in small
packets or tablets.
   It wasn't immediately clear to what extent NutraSweet
Spoonful would cannibalize Equal's market share. For now,
only Equal will be sold for restaurant use. But the products
will go head-to-head in the retail tabletop sweetener market,
of which Equal holds a 67% share, the spokesman said.
