International:
   Matra Wins Contract in Asia
Mr. Gut said that Goldstar and other Korean partners will
carry out roughly 25% of the work on the missiles. He said
the contract also includes a more general transfer of
technology to the Koreans.
   The Mistral is competing with the U.S. Stinger, Britain's
Javelin/Starstreak and Sweden's RBS 70 missiles.
   Noel Forgeard, chairman of Matra Defense, said 1991 profit
was about the same as in 1990. Revenue rose by about 10%, he
said. The stable profit performance was largely due to a
"massive" cost reduction program, he said.
