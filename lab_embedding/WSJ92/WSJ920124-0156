Union Asks Air Inter
   To Idle Airbus A320s
   During Crash Inquiry
The union has long been critical of the A320 because it
uses a two-pilot cockpit crew instead of the traditional
three-person crew that includes an engineer.
   The plane's makers acknowledged yesterday that A320s
previously had problems with a navigation computer. However,
an Airbus Industrie spokesman said that "this is an old thing
which has been treated and resolved." He wouldn't comment on
the nature of the problem and declined to speculate on
whether it had any bearing on the crash.
   Pilots disputed Airbus's assurance that the problem had
been resolved. A safety committee of the pilots' trade union
said air crews twice reported faulty navigation data last
year in the A320 -- the model that plowed without warning
into the Vosges mountains Monday as it was preparing to land
at Strasbourg.
