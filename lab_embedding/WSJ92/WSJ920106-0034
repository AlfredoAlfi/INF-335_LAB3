International:
   South Korea's Trade Gap
   Reaches a Record in 1991
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
According to Trade and Industry Ministry figures, the
South Korean merchandise trade gap was double that of 1990,
when a deficit of $4.83 billion was recorded. The figures are
reported on a customs clearance basis. While exports jumped
10.6% to $71.9 billion in 1991 from a year earlier, imports
expanded 17% to $81.56 billion.
   The Seoul government, trying to curb inflation currently
running at 10% annually, expanded imports of agricultural
products, and that in turn harmed the trade balance. Imports
of agricultural products for such purposes rose 11% to $9.8
billion in 1991.
   On Saturday, President Roh Tae Woo ordered his cabinet to
place top policy priority on reducing the trade deficit and
stabilizing prices.
