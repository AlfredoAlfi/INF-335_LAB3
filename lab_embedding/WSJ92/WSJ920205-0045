Business Brief -- Leslie Fay Cos.:
   Charges for Fourth Period
   To Total 8 Cents a Share
Leslie Fay, which is one of the representatives of the
unsecured creditors of Macy, said the write-down of
receivables from Macy follows the retailer's recent filing
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection. The Restivo and
Macy-related charges are each four cents a share.
   John J. Pomerantz, chairman and chief executive officer of
Leslie Fay, said that despite these charges it will report an
increase in 1991 earnings per share "to approximately $1.55,
versus $1.53 in the prior year, and we continue to look
forward to a strong 1992." The company expects to report
results in mid-February.
