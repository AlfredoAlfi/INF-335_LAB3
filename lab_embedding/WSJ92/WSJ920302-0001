Shawmut Will Refinance
   High-Interest Mortgages
Shawmut said that under an agreement with the state
attorney general, it will either refinance or provide cash
grants to about 50 individuals. It will also write to 269
other individuals who may be eligible for help under a new
claims resolution program.
   The pool of lower-interest-rate funds includes $5 million
to subsidize low-interest, no-fee loans to low-income
borrowers. A further $2 million will subsidize
home-improvement loans at a rate three points below market
rates.
   BayBanks Inc., another Boston-based bank, also agreed last
month to make $5 million available for low-interest home
improvement loans in low-income communities and to provide $6
million for "affordable" housing loans. It also will pay for
notifying 11,000 borrowers of their right to make claims for
damages they may have suffered because lenders failed to
disclose loan terms clearly.
