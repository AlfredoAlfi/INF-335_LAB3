U.S. Bancorp Agrees
   To Purchase Assets
   Of Merging Banks
BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, and Security Pacific,
based in Los Angeles, still plan to sell deposits in
Washington state, where U.S. Bancorp has a large presence and
is an eager bidder, as well as in Southern California and
Arizona. State legislators in Washington and Arizona are
considering bills designed to preserve competition that could
force the banks to sell more deposits than now planned.
   The deal makes U.S. Bancorp, Oregon's largest bank by far,
the third largest bank in Nevada, where it will have 9.5% of
the commercial banking market, and increases its Northern
California share to 7.4%. The bank holding company's deposit
base will rise 15% to $12.3 billion, from $10.7 billion at
the end of 1991.
