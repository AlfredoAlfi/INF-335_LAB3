Two Plead Guilty
   To Insider Charges
   In Hooker Acquisition
According to the government, Mr. Stone and a partner
helped Ms. Hurton obtain a mortgage for a condominium she was
buying by concealing the fact that they were financing her
down payment. In return for the down payment money, Ms.
Hurton agreed to provide Mr. Stone and the partner with
confidential information regarding a pending takeover of a
then-unnamed company.
   Ms. Hurton, who was at the time a paralegal in the Boston
office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom, in July 1987
told the two that Hooker planned to make a bid for Parisian.
Mr. Stone and his partner, the government says, bought 22,000
shares of Parisian and later sold the stock for a profit of
$273,375. Skadden represented Hooker, a Sydney, Australia,
holding company for general contractors and real estate
agents.
   A separate civil suit is pending, filed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and charging Mr. Stone, Ms. Hurton
and three others with violating insider trading laws.
