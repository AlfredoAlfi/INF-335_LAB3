   Postpones Payments;
   Infusion Move Fails
Founders Equity Inc., a New York investment group, had
agreed last month to make a capital infusion. However, "due
to the continuing negative effects of the recession on the
California retail environment, Founders requested changes in
the proposed transaction which were unacceptable to the
company and its lenders," said Stuart D. Buchalter, Standard
Brands Paint chairman.
   Mr. Buchalter said he didn't know whether suppliers would
continue to make deliveries to the company in the wake of the
announcement. Although the company has been in default for a
few weeks to its senior lenders, "I think we are pretty
current to suppliers," Mr. Buchalter said.
   Standard Brands Paint said it owes $119 million to its
senior debt holders, Sun America Cos. and Transamerica Life
Cos., and $26.3 million to Security Pacific National Bank.
The lenders are engaged in negotiations with the company and
the Los Angeles venture capital firm for a debt restructuring
and a $15 million capital infusion, Standard Brands Paint
said.
   Standard Brands Paint shares were quoted at $2.25, off
12.5 cents, in late New York Stock Exchange trading.
