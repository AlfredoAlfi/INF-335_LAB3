International Brief -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines:
   Expansion Plans Unveiled
   For European Operations
A KLM spokesman said the move will add 200 pilots and 800
flight attendants to the KLM staff. The carrier now has
nearly 1,000 pilots and 4,000 attendants.
   He said that a market share of 15% to 20% is KLM's
long-term goal, but the more immediate goal is 10%. He
declined to confirm speculation that KLM's drive to build its
European operations is a result of the Dutch flag carrier's
cooperation talks with British Airways PLC. Those talks also
involve Northwest Airlines, a unit of NWA Inc., which is
49%-owned by KLM.
   The driving force behind the move is the European
Community's attempt to deregulate the airline industry.
   Although KLM's fiscal 1991 performance forced the airline
to cut costs, the spokesman said there is no inherent
contradiction between the cost-cutting program and the
airline's current plans.
