The Bellcore document specifies features and functions
that equipment makers must consider as they build equipment
for networks that carry telephone traffic to neighborhoods on
fiber optic cables. It also defines services the fiber
systems are expected to provide and examines changes in
network design needed to provide such future services as
video-on-demand and interactive video.
