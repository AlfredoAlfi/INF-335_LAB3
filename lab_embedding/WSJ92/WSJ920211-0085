Olympia  York to Sell
   Part of Big U.K. Project
The sale will be marketed to individual investors who are
in a position to take advantage of tax incentives that the
Canary Wharf project receives, Mr. Dennis said.
   The executive said the plan was necessary because banks
and insurance companies, the traditional financing sources
for real estate, have dried up.
   The $6.5 billion project's success has been stalled by a
depressed London property market and poor transportation
links to the City of London.
   Mr. Dennis said the project is currently just under 60%
leased.
