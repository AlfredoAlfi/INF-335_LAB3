Business Brief -- Ashland Oil Co.:
   Spending for Projects Is Set
   At a Refinery in Kentucky
Ashland will also spend about $87 million on mostly
environmental projects to begin this year at its other two
refineries, in St. Paul Park, Minn., and Canton, Ohio, the
company said.
   "Changing environmental requirements are placing an
unprecedented capital burden on the refining industry, a
burden that some refiners may be unable to bear," Ashland
Chairman John R. Hall said. However, he added, "we believe
the long-term outlook for Ashland's refining operations is
good."
