Business Brief -- Tecumseh Products Co.:
   Firm to Propose 2 Classes
   Of Common to Shareholders
The maker of compressors, pumps, auto parts and engines
said the new classes of stock will have substantially
identical rights, except that purchasers of specified
percentages of the voting shares will be required to buy an
equal amount of nonvoting shares.
   The company, based in Tecumseh, Mich., said it will take
steps to allow both classes of stock to trade in
over-the-counter markets. A vote on the proposal will come at
Tecumseh's April 22 annual shareholders meeting.
