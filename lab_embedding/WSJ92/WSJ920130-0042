Business Brief -- Value City Department Stores:
   Management Predicts Profit
   Will Rise for Fiscal Year
Practically all of the Columbus, Ohio, company's profit is
earned in the first half, he said. That period includes
back-toschool and Christmas sales.
   The company went public last June, but 69% of the stock is
owned by its former parent, closely held Schottenstein Stores
Corp. Schottenstein has no plans to sell additional Value
City shares, Value City officials said.
   As previously reported, net for the Oct. 31 first quarter
jumped to 23 cents a share, from 13 cents. Sales rose to
$158.8 million, from $131.5 million.
   The 1992 first quarter was unusually strong, partly
because cold fall weather encouraged people to buy winter
merchandise, Mr. Iacono said. In addition, the sluggish
retail climate in other stores made a lot of merchandise
available at attractive prices.
