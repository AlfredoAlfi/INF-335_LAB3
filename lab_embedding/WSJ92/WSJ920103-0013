Letters to the Editor:
   A Good Bank Examiner
   Is No Mr. Milquetoast
Whatever examiners' total economic impact might be pales
by comparison with the effects of the 1986 Tax Act and
FIRREA, which changed the speculative economics of
real-estate investment on the one hand and tumbled over the
capacity to pyramid debt on the other by establishing limits
on loans to one borrower. Examiners have provided a huge
service to the country, by helping to restore sound credit
administration to the nation's financial institutions.
   Rather than berate examiners for doing their jobs well,
they should be recognized as essential agents of change as
the nation painfully but more productively redirects its
financial resources. My personal point of view is that
examiners in each of the agencies have done a fair, honest
job of asset classification. It's a difficult, often
confrontational job, in which milquetoasts generally don't
fare well.
