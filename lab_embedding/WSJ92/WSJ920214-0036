Business Brief -- BankAmerica Corp.:
   Security Pacific Subsidiary
   Could Be Sold to Aid Pact
The bill, approved by a committee in the state's House of
Representatives last Friday, could delay the deal in that it
seeks to limit any bank from having more than 30% of
commercial bank deposits statewide. After combining
operations, BankAmerica would have about 48% of such
deposits, though it has announced plans to divest itself of
certain operations, leaving it with about 42%.
   The Security Pacific unit, with assets of $7.6 billion and
163 branches, is Washington's second largest commercial bank,
after BankAmerica's Seattle First National Bank unit.
   Sponsors say the bill is an attempt to preserve
competition. A BankAmerica spokesman, who termed the possible
sale an "option," noted that the bill's definition of the
banking market does not take into account BankAmerica's
competition from savings and loans, and other non-bank
financial institutions.
