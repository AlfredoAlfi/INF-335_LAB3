Business Brief -- Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.:
   Unit Suspends Foreclosures
   Following FDIC Criticism
A Fleet spokesman said Recoll will review the 16,000 in
loans -- amounting to $6 billion -- that the government holds
to determine what steps it should take.
   When Providence, R.I.'s Fleet bought Bank of New England
last year, it assumed $14.5 billion in sound assets and left
the troubled assets with the FDIC. The FDIC picked Recoll to
manage, collect and liquidate the troubled loans.
   The Fleet spokesman said the length of the suspension of
foreclosures depends on how long reviews take.
