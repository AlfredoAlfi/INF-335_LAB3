Time Warner Holders Sue
   To Block Ex-Chief's Pay
A Time Warner spokesman dismissed the suit as baseless and
said the company is confident it will prevail.
   Mr. Nicholas resigned as co-chief executive officer almost
two weeks ago amid bitter strategic differences with, among
others, Steven J. Ross, chairman and co-chief executive
officer, and Gerald M. Levin, who succeeded Mr. Nicholas.
Associates of the three have characterized Mr. Nicholas's
departure as an ouster, though he formally resigned.
   The shareholders said that Mr. Nicholas's departure was
officially called a "voluntary resignation." Under that
circumstance, they argued, his employment contract calls for
him to be paid only what he had already earned.
   Named in the lawsuit, which was filed last week, were
Messrs. Ross, Nicholas and Levin and other top Time Warner
officers and directors.
