Business Brief -- Co-Steel Inc.:
   Steelmaker Plans to Issue
   Subordinate Voting Shares
Ron Fournier, executive vice president and deputy chief
executive, said the company wants to make an acquisition in
the U.S. or expand its existing operations, which are in
Canada, the U.S. and the United Kingdom. He said the company
is investigating opportunities in thin slab casting
technology but hasn't made any commitments.
   In the meantime, some of the net proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes and to help reduce Co-Steel's
consolidated debt of about C$115 million, Mr. Fournier said.
