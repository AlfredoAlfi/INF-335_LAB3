Presidential Suite in Texas
   Is Visited by Hard Times
Houstonian Properties Ltd. owns the 18-acre development
that includes the Houstonian Hotel. Daniel H. Johnston Jr.,
an attorney for Houstonian Properties, said the partnership
sought bankruptcy court protection after four years of
negotiations with lenders were unsuccessful. Mr. Johnston
said debt stands at about $28.5 million for property valued
at more than $50 million.
   HFund Hotel Corp., which leases and operates the hotel, is
not a party to the bankruptcy case.
   But Mr. Bush needn't worry. His suite will still be here
in August for the Republican convention. Mr. Johnston said
Houston Properties filed a plan for emerging from Chapter 11
at the same time it filed the bankruptcy petition and expects
approval within 120 days.
   Mr. Johnston said Houstonian Properties also wants to
raise as much as $3 million in additional financing to spruce
up buildings on the property. They include the fitness center
and the hotel, where suites go for as much as $800 a night.
