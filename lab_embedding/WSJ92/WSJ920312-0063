   Sen. D'Amato's Brother
   Is Indicted for Mail Fraud
The indictment didn't accuse Sen. D'Amato of any
wrongdoing, and the Justice Department said that it didn't
find any evidence that Sen. D'Amato was aware of the
fraudulent payments.
   Paul Rooney, Armand D'Amato's lawyer, said his client will
plead innocent and vigorously contest the charges.
   Sen. D'Amato said he cooperated fully with the Justice
Department, adding that he believes the investigation of his
involvement with his brother and Unisys is now closed. "I
have no knowledge of any investigation of me or my office,"
he said in a telephone interview. "The one thing I do know is
that my brother Armand is a good person . . . and I am
absolutely confident" he will be cleared.
