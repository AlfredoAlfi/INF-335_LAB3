Delta, American Air Balk
   At TWA's Business Fares
TWA is offering round-trip transcontinental coach fares of
$700, business fares of $1,100 and first-class fares of
$1,400. The catch is that most of TWA's transcontinental
flights require a stopover in St. Louis, a TWA hub. The
discounts, which are refundable and require no advance
purchase, are targeted at business fliers, who often make and
change travel plans at the last minute.
   Northwest Airlines was the lone carrier to match TWA's
move, but it doesn't fly many nonstop transcontinental
flights, either. Northwest is a unit of NWA Inc., which in
turn is a unit of Wings Holdings Inc.
   TWA might be trying to capture a recent interest in
business class. American plans to start transcontinental
business-class service on Feb. 4.
