International:
   Unilever Plans to Sell
   Six Farming Interests
   And Take a Charge
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
The six businesses that will be sold have combined annual
revenue of about #500 million.
   Unilever said it decided to shed the activities because it
"believes that these businesses will have a better future in
the ownership of companies which are dedicated to future
growth and development in their specific areas."
   The six interests that will be sold are the Barenbrug
Group, AMI S.r.L., Malta Clayton, prawn farming operations,
Marine Harvest International and BOC-Silcock Group.
   Unilever said that it has offered its 60% stake in the
Barenbrug Group to its minority partner. Unilever didn't
specify who this partner was.
   The prawn fishing operations are composed of Marine
Harvest Malaysia and a farming operation in Ivory Coast. Both
operations raise tiger prawns for the local market.
   Marine Harvest International, based in Scotland and Chile,
employs 950 people in salmon farming operations in Scotland
and salmon and prawn farming in Chile.
   The BOC-Silcock group is composed of two companies that
manufacture and market animal and fish feeds in the U.K. and
Ireland.
