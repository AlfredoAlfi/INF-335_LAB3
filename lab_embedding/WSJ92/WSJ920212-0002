Standard Brands Files
   For Bankruptcy Shield
   Under Chapter 11
Stuart D. Buchalter, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that the continuing recession in Southern California,
suppliers' refusal to deliver goods to the stores and the
company's inability to make its senior debt and bank loan
payments with current cash flow made a bankruptcy filing
"inevitable."
   Standard Brands said its petition showed total assets of
between $280 million and $285 million and total liabilities
of $185 million. The debt includes a $120 million mortgage
held by senior lenders Sun America Cos. and Transamerica Life
Cos. on substantially all of the company's real estate, a $26
million bank loan from Security Pacific National Bank and $21
million of trade debt.
   Despite the filing, it will be "business as usual" in the
company's 135 do-it-yourself paint stores, Mr. Buchalter
said. Standard Brands has arranged for a $17 million line of
credit that will be used to buy inventory for the company's
stores.
   About 100 of the company's stores are in California; the
others are in seven other Western states. "We have worked for
many months on several alternatives before concluding that
filing for Chapter 11 was best for the company and its
various constituents," Mr. Buchalter said.
