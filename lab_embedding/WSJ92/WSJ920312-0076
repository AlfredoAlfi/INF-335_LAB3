   Deal a Defeat to Company
The Morganton local government has been locked in a
six-year battle with TCI over the Denver company's Morganton
cable system. City officials attempted to evict TCI in 1986,
refusing to renew its cable franchise because of alleged
service lapses. TCI sued Morganton for $35 million in federal
court but lost the case, while continuing to operate in the
town. The cable operator has since lost in federal appeals
court and now has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
the case.
