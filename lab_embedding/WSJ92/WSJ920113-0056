Business Brief -- Smith  Nephew PLC:
   British Firm Settles Dispute
   With U.S. Concern Polteco
The settlement had been widely anticipated after a draft
version of the news release had been circulated without the
company's consent Thursday morning. Smith  Nephew denied the
news release later Thursday. It said Friday the settlement
was reached "overnight in California."
   A California court ruled early in 1990 that Smith 
Nephew's U.S. unit, Smith  Nephew Richards Inc., should pay
Polteco $96.2 million for breach of contract, fraud, breach
of confidence and trade secret misappropriation regarding the
development of a material for artificial hip and knee joint
implants.
   Smith  Nephew had appealed, but said it decided to settle
"considering the inherent risks involved in the litigation,"
legal costs, accruing interest and demands on management
resources.
