SIA's Chief Says He Hopes
   That Salomon Will Survive
Salomon faces civil fines that many are speculating will
reach $200 million and could be suspended as a primary dealer
of government debt. But Mr. James said he thought it would be
"a big mistake" for regulators to come down so hard that they
permanently disable the firm, which he called a "valuable
member" of the government securities market.
   In an interview, Mr. James, who is also chairman of
Raymond James  Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla., said the
trade group's board would back a roughly one percentage-point
increase in the top tax rate to pay for expanded
deductibility of individual retirement accounts. He said that
could help improve the country's poor savings rate.
   To shrink the massive budget deficit, the SIA board
suggested reducing the growth of Social Security deductions
to half the inflation rate, from its current
inflation-indexed rate, Mr. James said.
