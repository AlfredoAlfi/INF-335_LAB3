Business Brief -- Beverly Enterprises Inc.:
   Nursing-Care Chain's Net
   More Than Doubled in '91
"We really feel good about where we are," said Mr. Banks,
who began a back-to-basics campaign at the Fort Smith, Ark.,
nursing-home chain when he took over in 1989. "Revenues are
up. Cash flow is up. Earnings are up."
   The company said patient numbers rose in 1991 despite a
decline in the number of beds available. He said Beverly's
occupancy rate rose to 88.5% in 1991 from 87.3%.
   Even so, Medicaid rate increases averaging 6% to 7%
accounted for almost half of the year's increase in revenue.
State Medicaid programs pay for about 70% of Beverly's 80,000
patients.
   To lessen its dependence on Medicaid, the company has been
pursuing convalescent patients covered by Medicare, which can
pay daily benefits of $153.
