Continental Air Postpones
   2% Fare Rise to Saturday
The move comes as airlines, as expected, match fare cuts
on vacation-type fares from the U.S. to Europe. Delta Air
Lines and TWA, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., yesterday said they
would match discounting by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
American on Wednesday cut fares by as much as 33% to 11
European cities that it serves.
   Delta, which has the largest European route network of the
U.S. lines, said it would match the fare cuts. It serves 37
European cities, although yesterday a Delta spokesman said
the airline hadn't decided whether to spread American's fare
cuts to markets where the two don't overlap. TWA said its
largest discount is 40% to Rome from the East Coast.
   Other carriers such as Continental, USAir Group Inc. and
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines are expected to match the cuts.
