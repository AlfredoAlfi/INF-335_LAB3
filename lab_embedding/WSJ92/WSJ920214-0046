Business Brief -- Republic Health Corp.:
   Firm Signs Letter of Intent
   To Buy Safeco Health Unit
Republic Health, which had fiscal 1991 revenue of $467
million, said Safecare had revenue in fiscal 1991 of $127
million.
   The announcement came only days after Charles N. Martin, a
veteran hospital executive, assumed the reins of Republic
Health, vowing to enlarge it through acquisitions. The
arrival of Mr. Martin marked a turning point for Republic
Health, which had been under the management of a turnaround
specialist since entering bankrutpcy proceedings in 1990.
   Republic Health said it hasn't determined precisely how it
would pay for Safecare. But Mr. Martin has said that he will
fund acquisitions by tapping the equity market or taking on
added debt.
