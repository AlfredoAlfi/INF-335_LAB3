New York Bill Takes Aim
   At High Credit-Card Rates
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
While Mr. Brodsky and several supporters of the bill
aren't looking for such altruism between banks, they do hope
that the bill would create more competition and lower
credit-card interest rates, which average about 18.6%.
   "Consumers are able to make informed decisions if
information is provided to them in a reasonable form," Mr.
Brodsky said. "While we are reluctant, at this time, to
attempt to control or cap rates directly, we are convinced
that by requiring banks to provide consumer information, we
can free up the market's power to lower rates to a fair and
just level."
   Specifically, the bill would require banks to include in
their monthly statement, a list of at least 25 competing
issuers and their interest rates. The list would be compiled
by the state's banking department and include 25 issuers that
offer the lowest rates. The bill would apply to all banks
that issue credit cards to New York residents.
