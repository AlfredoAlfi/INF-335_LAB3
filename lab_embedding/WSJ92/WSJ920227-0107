Who's News:
   Clarke, Comptroller
   Of Currency, to Return
   To Former Law Firm
Although President Bush nominated Mr. Clarke for a second
five-year term, the Senate Banking Committee, on a party-line
vote, refused to confirm him. The panel tried to make Mr.
Clarke the scapegoat for the failure of the Bank of New
England and for other banking problems.
   President Bush hasn't nominated a new comptroller. Stephen
Steinbrink, the senior deputy comptroller for supervision, is
expected to run the agency as acting comptroller.
