Business Brief -- Memorex Telex N.V.:
   Operating Profit Fell 70%
   During Fiscal Third Quarter
Memorex said revenue for the fiscal nine months fell 9.5%
on an operating basis, to $1.1 billion from $1.22 billion a
year earlier. The company, which had been expected to come
out of bankruptcy proceedings quickly, also said that a
federal court in Wilmington, Del., approved its
reorganization plan. Memorex said it expects to emerge from
bankruptcy proceedings Feb. 18.
   As part of a plan to exchange equity for debt, the company
also said it will issue about 100 million American Depositary
Receipts, each of which will represent one share in the Dutch
company. Memorex said the shares should begin trading over
the counter in the U.S. by the end of the month.
