Bancario San Paolo
   Plans Italy's Biggest
   Initial Public Offer
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Final terms of the offer will be determined just before
the placement starts, but San Paolo said it plans to sell the
shares, which represent 20% of the bank's share capital, at
between 12,000 lire ($977) and 14,000 lire a share.
   The offer, to be made simultaneously in Italy and abroad,
has been underwritten separately by an Italian and an
international bank consortium. About 40% of the offer is
expected to be reserved for the international placement.
Goldman Sachs is San Paolo's financial adviser in the
transaction.
   The offer, which will raise the bank's nominal share
capital to 6.25 trillion lire, completes the restructuring of
San Paolo from a state bank into a partially privatized joint
stock company. The bank is controlled by San Paolo Holding
S.p.A.
