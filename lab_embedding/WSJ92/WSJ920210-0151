Neurogen Says Pfizer
   To Provide Funding
   For Drug Research
Neurogen said the agreement provides for a joint research
project. It also provides for Pfizer to pay Neurogen for
access to certain technology and for the achievement of
certain results. In addition, Pfizer will buy one million
shares of Neurogen stock in a private transaction, at a
market price that was set in the past few days; Neurogen
declined to elaborate. The investment will give Pfizer,
Groton, Conn., about an 11% stake in Neurogen.
   The initial research will focus on finding an
anxiety-relieving drug that will bind only to a specific type
of receptor in the brain. At the moment, tranquilizers such
as Valium attach themselves to a whole family of receptor,
which researchers believe is why they can cause side effects,
such as drowsiness and short-term memory loss. Any
breakthrough could create a huge opportunity, because drugs
such as Valium produced world-wide revenue of more than $2.5
billion last year, Neurogen estimated.
