   President, Posts Drop
   In Third-Quarter Net
Mr. Gregory, 56 years old, had planned over three years
ago to retire early and pursue personal interests, the
restaurant operator said. He will become vice chairman and
"an active consultant," Sizzler said. Mr. Bermingham is 47.
   In the latest quarter, Sizzler's revenue rose 11% to
$158.7 million from $142.5 million. It cited the recession
and highly competitive conditions domestically for its lower
earnings, but said its international division "continues to
record strong growth and increased profits."
   For the 40-week period, net income rose 1.3% to $17.2
million, or 58 cents a share, from $16.9 million, or 74 cents
a share, on an 11% rise in revenue to $409.7 million from
$370.1 million.
