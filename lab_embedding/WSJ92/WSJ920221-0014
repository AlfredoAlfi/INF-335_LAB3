Illinois and Chicago
   Pick Tentative Site
   For Proposed Airport
Final selection of the site is subject to regulatory
approval.
   The new airport isn't expected to open until 2005. Its
current projected cost is $10.8 billion. Under current plans,
the airport would have an annual capacity of 920,000 flights
and would have 165 gates, compared with O'Hare's 813,895
flights in 1991 and current capacity of 148 gates.
   The new airport is to be built on 8,200 acres with six
runways and the capacity for one more; O'Hare takes up 7,700
acres with six runways, plus one for general aviation.
Projections indicate 43.5 million passengers would use the
new airport in 2020. Last year, 59.9 million passengers used
O'Hare.
   The idea of a third airport has been the center of hot
political battles for years. Lake Calumet residents, some of
whom would probably be displaced by the new airport, are
expected to bitterly fight the selection of their area.
   Airport proponents argue that the facility would create as
many as 200,000 jobs, and they say O'Hare won't be able to
meet passenger demand in the next century. But there is some
question among aviation experts about whether future traffic
volume will support big airport projects such as this one.
