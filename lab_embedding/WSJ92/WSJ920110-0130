International:
   Food Shortage Hits Capital
   Of Estonia; Rationing Set

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Other measures in the government's seven-point emergency
plan include the suspension of managers of state-owned
companies; the managers were blamed for dishonest practices.
   "We have evidence that cartels in some parts of Estonia
have deliberately hoarded food, controlled supply and set
their own prices," Mr. Brus said.
   Food was in ample supply in Estonia's towns and villages,
while Tallinn is suffering from acute shortages of basics.
The bread shortage stems from last year's 44% drop in
agreed-upon grain supplies from Russia.
   "They failed to deliver 125,000 metric tons of grain, and
there are no indications of new deliveries this year," Mr.
Brus said.
   Food shortages also were caused by Russian purchases of
Estonian agricultural products for hard currency. Estonia,
which broke away from the crumbled Soviet Union, still
depends on Russia for 90% of its foreign trade.
