Credit Ratings:
   Chemical Banking's
   Debt Ratings Lifted
   By Moody's Investors
Moody's action follows Standard  Poor's Corp.'s decision
last week to put Chemical's debt on review for a possible
upgrade for much the same reasons. An SP spokesman said its
review continues, pending discussions with the company's
management later this month.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Chemical shares jumped $1.25 to $27.50.
   The banking companies merged in a stock swap, which had
been approved by shareholders and the Federal Reserve Board.
The merger created the second-largest U.S. bank company, with
$139 billion in assets. Citicorp is the largest.
   While Manufacturers Hanover's debt has been assumed by
Chemical, the surviving company in the merger, that debt will
continue to be known as Manufacturers Hanover debt until
maturity, according to Moody's.
   Moody's said the raised ratings also reflect an expected
increase in the merged banks' capitalization following a
planned $1.25 billion public offering of common stock later
this month. But Moody's cautioned that Chemical will remain
burdened with very large commercial real estate exposure and
nonperforming assets, which may require Chemical to take
further loss provisions.
