Hurwitz-Led Group
   Is Said to Seek Stake
   In Continental Air
People familiar with the proposal said it stood little
chance of success in the near term. Continental, a unit of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., has been looking for
investors since before it filed for Chapter 11 protection in
late 1990. It has said it is seeking as much as several
hundred million dollars in new equity.
   The company last month submitted a reorganization plan to
the bankruptcy court that didn't mention any outside
investors. The plan called for eliminating about $4 billion
in debt, wiping out common and preferred shares and
collapsing its intricate corporate structure into one parent
and three subsidiaries. The company has said it expects to
emerge from Chapter 11 protection this year.
