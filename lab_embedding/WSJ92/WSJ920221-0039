Business Brief -- Mayne Nickless Ltd.:
   After-Tax Operating Profit
   Soars in First Six Months
The latest period's result includes a pretax extraordinary
profit of A$70.5 million from selling investments.
   Operating profit before abnormal items rose 0.7% to A$51.6
million.
   Mayne Nickless also announced plans to raise A$322 million
through a 1-for-5 rights issue of shares to existing
shareholders at A$6.75 a share.
   The price of A$6.75 for the new shares compares with
Thursday's closing market price of A$7.88. Directors said
proceeds from the rights issue "will provide further strength
to the company's capital base" and "place Mayne Nickless in a
position to expand its core activities in transport, security
and health-care services as opportunities arise." They didn't
comment on the amount to be invested in a previously
announced move into telecommunications.
