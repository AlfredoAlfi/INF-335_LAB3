Business Brief -- Loewen Group Inc.:
   Company Scraps Its Plan
   To Purchase Arbor Capital
As previously reported, Loewen Group, the second biggest
funeral company in North America, planned to offer 13
Canadian dollars (US$10.86) an Arbor share, for a total of
C$101 million (US$84.4 million).
   Raymond Loewen, president and chief executive officer of
Loewen Group, said the plan was dropped because of opposition
by Arbor Chairman Daniel Scanlan, who controls about 53% of
Arbor's Class A voting shares.
   "Mr. Scanlan has decided this is not the time to formalize
a relationship (with Loewen Group), so we'll try again
another time," Mr. Loewen said. Loewen Group is based in
Vancouver, British Columbia.
