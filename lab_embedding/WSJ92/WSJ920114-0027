Technology Brief -- Intergraph Corp.:
   Firm's Latest Workstations
   Feature New Microprocessors
Analysts said the new technology will enable the computer
graphics systems company, based in Huntsville, Ala., to keep
abreast of its rivals, but won't help first-quarter earnings.
   The workstations, which will be available in a dozen
different configurations, will list for $18,500 to $100,000,
prices that are comparable to those of the company's current
offerings, said Jim Meadlock, chairman and chief executive
officer. The company said it will begin shipping the new
units in March.
   Intergraph expects revenue to climb to between $1.2
billion and $1.4 billion in 1992, he said. Mr. Meadlock
declined to comment on 1991 revenue and earnings, which will
be reported later this month.
