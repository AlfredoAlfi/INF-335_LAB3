Business Brief -- Home Oil Co.:
   Capital Expenditures in 1992
   Will Fall to $87.5 Million
Separately, Home said it agreed to sell about C$35 million
of oil and gas assets, including its 2.25% stake in the
Caroline natural gas field in northern Alberta to a unit of
Shell Canada Ltd., 78%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group. The
transaction, the value of which hasn't been disclosed, is
expected to close in the first quarter of 1992. Home Oil said
its production volumes won't be affected by the sale since
Caroline isn't expected to begin production until later this
year.
   Home said it plans to sell more assets this year, a
process the company said will result in lower operating costs
and greater efficiency. It said proceeds from any sales and
some of Home's cash flow from operations, will be applied to
reduce the company's debt levels. As of Sept. 30, 1991, the
company had C$535 million of long-term debt outstanding.
