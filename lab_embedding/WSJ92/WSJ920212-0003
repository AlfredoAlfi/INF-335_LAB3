   Sharp Increase in Net
   For Its Fourth Period
Nolan D. Archibald, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company is "cautiously optimistic" for 1992. "We are
anticipating gradual economic improvement in the U.S.,
particularly during the second half of the year," he added.
   Black  Decker attributed the fourth-quarter improvement
in part to "substantially lower" interest expenses as well as
modest profitability in its Brazil operations compared with a
significant loss there in 1990. Last year, the company sold
150,000 shares of preferred stock to Newell Co., a hardware
manufacturer, for $150 million, which it used to reduce debt.
The company had been selling assets to pay down a $2.8
billion loan used to buy Emhart Corp. in 1989. It also sold
the Brazilian division of its Mallory Controls business for
$11 million last May.
   Fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. were "somewhat stronger"
than the company had expected, particularly in power tools,
household products and the company's Kwikset locks. Mr.
Archibald said it was "premature" to cite a positive trend,
but noted that retail inventories aren't overstocked and will
need to be replenished when market conditions improve.
   Black  Decker shares rose on the announcement, and in
late New York Stock Exchange trading were quoted at $24.625,
up $1.875.
