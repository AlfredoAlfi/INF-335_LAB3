International:
   North Korea Faces Shortage
   As Russian Oil Aid Declines
   ----
   A Wall Street Journal News Roundup
Prior to 1990, North Korea received around 800 metric tons
of oil from the Soviet Union every year for nominal sums of
money in rubles, virtually as a form of economic aid. Since
last year, when Moscow began demanding settlements in hard
currency, the supply has fallen precipitously. North Korea
now receives about 70 or 80 metric tons of oil a year.
   As a result, many industrial enterprises in North Korea
reportedly are now operating at half capacity, if at all,
Itar-Tass said. The oil shortage in Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital, is aggravated by the fact that China -- another
important economic partner and provider of oil -- has also
switched to settlements in convertible currency.
