Who's News:
   Penguin USA Names
   Two to Top Positions
   At Principal Divisions
Mr. Silverman succeeds Christine Pevitt, who resigned in
June. Ms. Pevitt presided over both the hardcover and
paperback divisions, but those duties have now been split.
   Kathryn Court, 43, was named publisher and editor in chief
of Penguin Books, the paperback division. Ms. Court had been
editorial director of Penguin.
   Literary agents and other publishers applauded the
appointments, saying both Mr. Silverman and Ms. Court are
known as skilled editors and "book lovers," unlike some
recent management hires in publishing, whose experience was
more financial than literary.
   Also, Penguin USA named Arnold Dolin, 63, to the new post
of publisher and editor in chief of Plume Books, the
paperback line in the NAL/Dutton division. Mr. Dolin
continues to serve as associate publisher of NAL/Dutton.
   The appointments follow a period of turbulence at Penguin
USA. After a drop in profit in 1990, the publisher shuffled
executives, streamlined its back-office operations, abolished
about 20 jobs and cut back its list of titles by more than
10%.
   John F. Moore, recently named president of Penguin USA,
said the company's performance has improved considerably. He
said Penguin USA had "the best fourth quarter in the
company's history."
