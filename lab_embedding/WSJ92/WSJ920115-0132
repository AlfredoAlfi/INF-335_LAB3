   Seidman Accepts Offer
   To Serve as Consultant
   With His Former Firm
He said the accounting profession faces huge changes in
possibly tougher standards for financial statements and
needed legal protection from potential liabilities.
"Accountants didn't do what they should have to protect the
public in the thrift debacle, and this will have to change,"
he added.
   A former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
and the Resolution Trust Corp., Mr. Seidman became a
commentator on cable television last year. He was managing
partner of BDO Seidman, then known as Seidman  Seidman, from
1968 to 1974, and is the son of Frank Seidman, one of two
brothers who founded the firm in 1910.
