California Agency to Offer
   Norplant Contraceptive
Molly Joel Coye, California health director, declined to
say whether Norplant's $350 price had been cut but said an
agreement by Wyeth-Ayerst to train state physicians and other
workers had cut the state's overall costs.
   A spokeswoman for Wyeth-Ayerst said the company stuck to
its one-price policy and that California hasn't received any
more training services than the company is providing to other
states.
   Norplant consists of six silicone rubber capsules that are
implanted in a woman's upper arm and gradually release a
hormone that can protect against pregnancy for as much as
five years.
