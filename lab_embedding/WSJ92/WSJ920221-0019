Business Brief -- American Health Properties Inc.:
   Talks Begin on Deferring
   Interest Due to Company
American Health also said Continental Medical Systems
Inc., a provider of medical rehabilitation services based in
Mechanicsburg, Pa., has exercised an option to purchase
American Health's interest in a San Diego rehabilitation
hospital for about $2.8 million. The company said it expects
to complete the transaction by March 31 and that, when it
closes, it will result in an extraordinary credit of about
$2.8 million, or about 16 cents a share.
   Robert L.B. Diener, American Health's president and chief
executive officer, said the sale would allow American Health
to defer the 1992 Four Winds interest payments "without
interruption of the earnings or dividend growth of the
company."
