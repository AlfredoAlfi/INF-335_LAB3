Business Brief -- Tacoma Boatbuilding Co.:
   Protection From Creditors
   Is Sought Under Chapter 11
The company, based in Tacoma, Wash., said it will continue
repairing ships, operating Northern Line Machine and pursuing
additional business during Chapter 11 proceedings. It blamed
poor performance of its now-discontinued luxury yacht
subsidiary and the loss of U.S. Navy work as reasons for its
current situation.
   Tacoma Boatbuilding previously sought Chapter 11
protection in 1985, emerging from Chapter 11 two years later.
