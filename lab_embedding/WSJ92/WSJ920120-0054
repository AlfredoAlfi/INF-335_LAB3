   Hertz Over New Surcharge
Hertz, which is 49% owned by Ford Motor Co., announced
imposition of surcharges as high as $56 a day on renters who
live in the Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens boroughs of
the city. Hertz said it imposed the charges because of
exposure to so-called vicarious liability lawsuits. Consumer
groups in the state have called for boycotts against Hertz.
   "Lawyers investigating this matter have concluded that
this practice has a disparate impact on minorities and
nonwhite communities," said New York City Mayor David N.
Dinkins.
   "State law contains a crystal-clear prohibition against
the imposition of surcharges by car rental companies," said
State Attorney General Robert Abrams. "Whatever Hertz might
think of the state's vicarious liability law, surcharges --
particularly surcharges that may discriminate against certain
groups -- are illegal, and may not be used as a protest
tactic by the company."
   Hertz officials could not be reached for comment.
