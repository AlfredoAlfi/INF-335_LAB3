International:
   Japan's Asahi to Sell
   Its Beer in Britain
   Through Fosters Unit
It marks the first time a Japanese brewery has linked up
with a local beer maker to market Japanese beer in a foreign
country. Asahi aims to sell three million bottles of the beer
in British pubs and liquor stores this year, the spokesman
said. He added that the company hopes to produce the beer
locally under a license within several years.
   The tie-up comes at a time when sales of Asahi's "Super
Dry" brand is slowing in Japan. After causing a splash in the
Japanese beer industry in 1987 and boosting Asahi's market
share, sales of the brand were hurt by new beers launched by
the company last year. Asahi sold 2.08 billion bottles of the
Super Dry brand in Japan last year, down 10% from sales in
1990. Asahi exports an annual 1.4 million bottles of the
Super Dry brand to the U.S.
