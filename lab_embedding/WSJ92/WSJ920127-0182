Digital Unit to Work
   With Seiko Epson
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major economic daily, reported
that the two companies plan to jointly develop a network
system before the end of this year.
   Digital Equipment is believed to lag behind other computer
companies in its entry into the Japanese market in this
sector. For Seiko Epson, which faces increasing competition
in its main business of PCs, the move reflects the company's
desire to expand from PC manufacturing to involvement in a
more broad-based system network.
