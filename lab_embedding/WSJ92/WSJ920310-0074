Business Brief -- American Stores Co.:
   Fiscal Fourth-Quarter Net
   Fell 32% to $58.9 million
The Salt Lake City company, which operates grocery stores,
combination stores and drugstores, said it took an $11.8
million after-tax charge in the quarter to cover legal
expenses from remaining legal claims against the company
stemming from salmonella cases dating to 1985. The company
said it posted one-time, after-tax losses of $7.6 million on
sales of assets and abandonment of property.
   American Stores attributed the remainder of the net drop
to the economy's impact on sales and on money-losing stores.
Sales at grocery and combination stores in operation for more
than a year fell 2.3% in the quarter, the company said.
   For the year, American Stores reported net income of
$199.4 million, or $3.47 a share, compared with $182.4
million, or $2.64 a share, the year before. The year's
revenue fell to $20.82 billion from $22.16 billion.
