ITT Finance Unit
   Settles Allegations
   On Bill Collection
A spokesman for the attorney general's office said the
investigation found widespread violations of bill-collection
laws, such as multiple calls to debtors and their families,
abusive language during calls, and calls to employers and
family members about the debtor's delinquent bills. The
attorney general's investigation stemmed from dozens of
complaints received by the Wisconsin banking commissioner
about the company.
   The settlement was approved by a state court in Madison,
Wis.
   ITT neither admitted nor denied the allegations. A
spokeswoman for the company's consumer-financial services
unit said the company cooperated with the investigation.
"We're concerned about every collection complaint," she said.
   The $1.4 million settlement includes $110,000 to fund the
hiring of an independent auditor, who will review and report
on the company's collection procedures for six to 12 months.
The attorney general's office said it may take further action
if any alleged violations are found by the auditor.
   The settlement also includes $25,000 to be used by the
state banking commissioner to educate consumers about
debt-collection laws.
