GM's Retirement Package
But this time, company executives are warning that
sweetened retirement deals won't be offered again soon.
Moreover, GM executives aren't ruling out firing white-collar
workers later this year if the company falls short of its
cost-cutting goals.
   "We won't have a retirement window next year," a GM
spokesman said. "It's a business decision. We want to
accomplish our goals as quickly as possible." In addition,
the spokesman said, certain federal regulations could
penalize GM if the auto maker continues to offer special,
sweetened retirement terms to some employees but not others.
   In December, GM said it would shut 21 more factories and
cut a total of 74,000 salaried and hourly jobs by 1995 as
part of a sweeping retrenchment. The company said it would
shed some 9,000 of its roughly 91,000 white-collar jobs in
North America in this year alone. Now it appears that GM is
pushing to accomplish that initial 10% cut in salaried staff
by midyear.
