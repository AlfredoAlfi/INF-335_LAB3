Bridge Oil Reports
   Profit of $21.7 Million
   For the Latest Year
The company said that unless there is an improvement in
average product prices, last year's profit level will be
"difficult to maintain" in 1992.
   The company said the results were achieved after a A$10.2
million provision for taxation. Bridge has "substantial" tax
credits available, so a tax liability isn't expected until
1997 "at the earliest," the company said.
   Last year the company replaced much of its Australian
production with new reserves, Bridge said. The company added
that it aims to continue strong cash flow, cut debt further
and maintain long-term oil and gas reserves.
   The 1990 loss was mostly due to a writedown of the
company's investment in the Aredor diamond project in Guinea,
West Africa. Aredor reported positive cash flow for the
latest year, despite incurring an accounting loss of A$1.5
million.
