Letters to the Editor:
   Just Who Are These
   Sadly Unaware Folks?
Who are these average people who read only those magazines
that rely "heavily" on cigarette advertising? Do they read
newspapers or look at TV? Is there anybody out there who has
not been bombarded for the past 40 years with reports and
studies about the dangers of smoking?
   If it is indeed true that -- as the man from the Rodale
Press said -- "Magazines are reluctant to `bite the hand that
feeds them,' "shouldn't you at least question the effect on
magazine coverage of the 93% to 100% of the other
advertisements? For example, advertisers of vitamin and
mineral supplements make up more than 7% of the ad revenue in
Rodale's Prevention magazine. Isn't it just possible that the
study shows that Prevention does not report news critical of
these supplements because it does not want to "bite the hand
that feeds them"? And what about all of those auto and beer
ads? Are the magazines and the newspapers and the TV networks
deliberately underestimating the safety questions raised
about these products?
