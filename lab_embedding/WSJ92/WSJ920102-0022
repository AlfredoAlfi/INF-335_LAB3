Freddie Mac Suspends
   Unit of Sierra Tahoe
   From Mortgage Sales
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Since the mortgage division accounts for less than 10% of
Sierra Tahoe's net income, Truckee River said the suspension
is not expected to have a "material adverse effect" on
financial results. However, the company said it cannot
predict the financial impact of the suspension, should it
continue for an "extended period of time."
   In a news release, the company said Freddie Mac asserted
it took this action after "an investigation revealed that
material misrepresentations were made as to the value and
quality of certain mortgages sold by certain Truckee
employees to Freddie Mac." Freddie Mac's investigation was
prompted by allegations made by an attorney representing
certain Sierra Tahoe shareholders, said Truckee River.
   Truckee River said it intends to appeal Freddie Mac's
decision and will seek reinstatement.
   The company said it is also undertaking an investigation
of its mortgage division and has already taken certain steps
to address Freddie Mac's concerns.
   Truckee River said the suspension will not affect its
status as a servicer of Freddie Mac mortgages.
