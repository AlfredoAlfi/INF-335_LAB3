Credit Ratings
UPJOHN Co. (Kalamazoo, Mich.) -- Standard  Poor's Corp.
affirmed its ratings for $775 million of the company's debt,
but added that there is potential for downgrading the big
pharmaceutical concern's ratings over the next three years.
The credit rating concern changed its outlook on Upjohn to
"negative" from "stable." SP said it was concerned that
Upjohn's product pipeline "may not regenerate the outstanding
cash flow levels of recent years," provided by some Upjohn
drugs whose patents will expire in the future. But SP
affirmed its double-A rating on Upjohn's senior unsecured
debt and its A-plus commercial paper rating, noting Upjohn's
financial strength and "well-established industry presence."
William U. Parfet, Upjohn's president, said SP officials
made Upjohn executives aware of their concerns in a meeting
on Tuesday. Mr. Parfet said Upjohn's drug pipeline will
produce products that will help the company maintain a strong
cash flow "without taking financial steps that would weaken
our credit quality."
