Notable  Quotable
There's nothing inherently inconsistent between a
hard-core conservatism and a strategy for saving the global
environment. The way conservatives articulate the ideology,
the environmental concern is just a kind of put-up deal to
advance the power of the state. And they're just wrong about
that. I mean, Teddy Roosevelt, was the leading
environmentalist in this century, among politicians, and he
was a Republican.
