International Brief -- British Aerospace PLC:
   Concern Proposes Venture
   With Japan Aircraft Makers
The meetings, reported yesterday in London by the
Financial Times, represent another attempt by the European
aerospace industry to loosen the Japanese industry's nearly
exclusive relationship with Boeing Co. of the U.S. The Airbus
Industrie consortium, of which British Aerospace is a member,
recently proposed that the three Japanese companies join the
Europeans in making a super jumbo jet.
   Boeing doesn't make a small, 100-seat plane, so any such
tie-up wouldn't directly affect the U.S. company's
relationship with Japanese industry. Still, the Mitsubishi
spokesman said the companies would consult with Boeing before
taking action.
