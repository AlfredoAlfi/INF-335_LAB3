NationsBank to Sell
   7 Million New Shares
NationsBank said it expects the new shares to be sold
within about 30 days at a price to be determined by the
company and its underwriters just before the sale. Based on
its share price yesterday in late trading on the New York
Stock Exchange of $43.75, the seven million new shares would
raise $306 million before expenses.
   NationsBank, which had 231.2 million shares outstanding at
the end of 1991, said proceeds of the offering would be used
for general corporate purposes and possible additional
capital contributions to its subsidiaries.
   The company said six million of the shares will be offered
in the U.S. and one million will be sold in Europe. The bank
holding company said it granted underwriters an overallotment
provision for up to an additional 1,050,000 shares.
   Merrill Lynch  Co. is leading a syndicate of
underwriters.
