Silicone-gel breast implants, aside from alleged links to
diseases of the immune system, tend to interfere with
mammograms done to detect breast cancer. The triglyceride
implants, by contrast, aren't expected to interfere with
mammograms, the Washington University doctors said.
Additionally, they say, the triglyceride filler appears not
to be harmful to human tissues in the event of leakage or the
rupture of the implant.
