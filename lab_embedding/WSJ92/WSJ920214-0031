Cigna Net Fell 9.2%,
   Continental Had Loss
   In Fourth Quarter
For the year, Cigna's profit rose 36% to $449 million, or
$6.28 a share, from $330 million, or $4.36 a share, in 1990.
Revenue edged up 3% to $18.8 billion from $18.2 billion. The
company said its employee benefits, pension, and individual
life insurance businesses reported earnings increases, but
the property and casualty business continues to have poor
results because of the competitive pricing environment.
   Continental, based in New York, posted a net loss of $19.3
million, or 37 cents a share, for the fourth quarter,
compared with profit of $53.1 million, or 96 cents a share,
in the 1990 same period. Revenue fell 7% to $1.4 billion from
$1.5 billion.
   For the year, Continental's net fell 60% to $56.4 million,
or 98 cents a share, from $141.1 million, or $2.53 a share,
in 1990. Revenue declined 5% to $5.4 billion from $5.7
billion.
   The company's results were affected mostly by higher
underwriting losses, including larger catastrophe losses, and
lower net investment income.
