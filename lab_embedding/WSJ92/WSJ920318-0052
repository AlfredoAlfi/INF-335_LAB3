International Brief -- Glaxo Holdings PLC:
   Migraine Drug Sales Efforts
   Are Focus of French Probe
Government authorities have voiced concern that Glaxo is
using hard-sell tactics to maximize revenue from Sumatriptan,
a very costly treatment, before competing drugs hit the
market. The British pharmaceutical concern has confronted
similar problems in Denmark.
   Glaxo, in response, said, "we are confident our French
company has acted properly and in a way consistent with the
highest standards of our industry."
   The Social Affairs Ministry said a conference of medical
experts will decide on diagnostic guidelines for Sumatriptan.
Then regulators will determine a reasonable price range.
