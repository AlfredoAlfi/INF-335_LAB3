Business Brief -- Polaroid Corp.:
   Company Institutes Freeze
   On Hiring Until June 30
A spokesman said that Mr. Booth was referring to operating
profit, which fell 13% last year to $246.6 million from
$284.3 million. Net income rose to $683.7 million or $12.54 a
share, including the benefits of a $925 million pretax gain
from settlement of patent litigation against Eastman Kodak
Inc. Revenue for the year rose 5% to $2.07 billion from $1.97
billion.
   Polaroid's fourth-quarter results were stronger than
expected, leading to a rise in its stock price when they were
reported last month. But analysts then warned that those
results might not be sustainable.
   Mr. Booth said that the need for heavy spending related to
planned introduction this year of its medical-imaging
systems, which it calls Helios, and a new compact instant
camera, which it calls Joshua, required the cost controls.
   Polaroid has 11,000 workers. A spokesman said Polaroid
won't boost base pay for workers this year, but it will
continue to give increases based on performance.
