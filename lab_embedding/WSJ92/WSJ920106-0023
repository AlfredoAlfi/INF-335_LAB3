Steinway Unit to Market
   Pianos Produced in Japan
Steinway, which didn't say how much it spent on its new
line, took pains to differentiate between its mass-produced
"Boston" piano and the instrument once played by Franz Liszt
and praised by 19th-century composer Gioacchino Rossini. A
spokesman said the new pianos will be aimed at the "midrange"
market and sell for about $14,000, or "a slight premium" to
those of competitors Yamaha and Kawai. By contrast, Steinways
start at $22,000 and rise to as much as $65,000 for a concert
grand piano.
   The company, which has come under some criticism lately
for a decline in the quality of its pianos, said its Steinway
pianos "will continue to be hand-crafted in the U.S. and
Germany as they have been for over a century."
