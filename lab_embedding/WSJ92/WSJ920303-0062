   Toshiba Unit Again Trims
   Notebook Computer Prices
The Toshiba Corp. unit said the moves were part of its
strategy of offering "the industry's most advanced notebooks
at competitive prices." Some rivals, including Dell Computer
Corp., cut prices last month. Others plan to introduce a new
class of ultra-lightweight machines as soon as next month.
