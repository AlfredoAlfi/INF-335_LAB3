Pepper...and Salt
We've given up company cars
   And the corporate dining room,
   But the prospect of more givebacks
   Is filling our place with gloom.
   As cost-cutting mania spreads,
   A sense of fear is inspired
   That they'll ask for gold-watch givebacks
   From those who have retired.
   -- Edward F. Dempsey.

   If you buy a wig on credit
   It may last for years --
   But another factor to consider:
   You are in debt over your ears.
   -- Max Braverman.
