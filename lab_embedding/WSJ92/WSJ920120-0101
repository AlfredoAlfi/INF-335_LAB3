Hong Kong Exchange
   Will Seek to Permit
   Some Short-Selling
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
In short-selling, an investor sells borrowed securities,
with the obligation of buying them back at a later date to
repay the lender. It enables players to bet that a share's
price will decline.
   Mr. Chow said such trades won't be allowed in a wider
spectrum of issues until the exchange implements its central
clearing and settlement system, which some believe may take
another year.
   He said his other top objectives for the exchange are to
work toward establishing trading in options on specific
shares, which he said isn't likely before late 1993, and to
continue working toward establishing a second board for
mainland companies.
