International:
   EC Parliament Approves
   Tobacco Advertising Ban
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
A ban on TV advertising went into effect last year. The
new proposal, which Parliamentarians approved by a 150 to 123
vote, would outlaw tobacco ads in magazines, newspapers and
billboards. Tobacco sponsorship of sporting events would also
be outlawed. Ads would be allowed only inside tobacco shops.
   The measure has been harshly criticized by industry
lobbyists, who say it is an unfair attack on free speech. The
Confederation of European Community Cigaret Manufacturers, an
industry trade group, reasserted its members' rights "to
advertise, to compete in a free market economy and to
communicate its new product developments and innovations to
their consumers."
   Under EC rules, the council of ministers now has several
months to come up with a compromise proposal, one that will
take into account, but not be as tough, as the blanket ban
sought by the parliament. The parliament can then reintroduce
tougher amendments to bring the proposal back up to its
stringent standards. But to do that, the amendments must be
approved by 260 votes, or a majority of the 518-member body.
