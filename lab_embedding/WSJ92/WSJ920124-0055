Creditors Criticize
   Judiciary Report
   On Federconsorzi
The foreign banks further said they believe that "behavior
of this sort has contributed to the general reluctance of
first-class financial institutions to lend to the Italian
public sector."
   The banks, which are owed a total of $300 million by
Federconsorzi, have insisted they be repaid in full because
they consider Federconsorzi a de facto public agency backed
by the Treasury.
   Federconsorzi foundered last April under more than eight
trillion lire ($6.7 billion) of debt. Three
government-appointed commissioners have since drawn up a plan
for a court-supervised liquidation of Federconsorzi's assets
that should guarantee a repayment ratio of at least 73.9%.
   The liquidation plan will be voted upon Wednesday.
