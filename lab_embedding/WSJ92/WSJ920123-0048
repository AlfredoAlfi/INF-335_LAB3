   Xerox Names Brown
   As Chief Executive
   At Crum  Forster
Over the last two years, Crum  Forster has been shedding
operations to focus on commercial insurance. It withdrew from
the personal-insurance market and sold an auto insurance
unit, among other steps.
   In an interview, Mr. Brown said Crum  Forster was
modestly profitable last year, but "well below where it needs
to be long term." He said he wants the company's return on
equity to reach 15% to 18% over the next five years, up from
the current industry average of 8% to 10%.
