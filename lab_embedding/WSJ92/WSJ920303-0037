International Brief -- Boral Ltd.:
   Operating Profit Fell 29%
   To $68.8 Million in 1st Half
The company cut its dividend 33% to 8 Australian cents
from 12 Australian cents.
   Boral said that "while the group is well positioned to
benefit as world economies recover from the excesses of the
1980s, the group's results for the half year to June 1992 are
unlikely to exceed the corresponding period in 1991."
   Business in January and February "continued to be subdued,
with extreme weather conditions in California, southern
Germany and parts of Australia," the company said.
   Boral expects "modest recovery" in the U.S. in the current
fiscal year, but said "there is little likelihood of any real
growth in the U.K. for a longer period. In Australia, the
demand for materials for commercial building construction is
forecast to decline for some time."
