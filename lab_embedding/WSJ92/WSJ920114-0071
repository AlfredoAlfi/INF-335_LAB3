   Intel, Advanced Micro Suit
   In Texas to Be Transferred
The outcome of the cases could determine whether Advanced
Micro can continue its booming sales of its clones of Intel's
386 chips, which go into popular personal computers. An
Advanced Micro lawyer said he expects the California court to
consolidate the cases.
   In the Texas suit, Intel argued that Advanced Micro's 386
clone chips illegally include Intel-copyrighted software
called microcode. In its California suit, filed in 1990,
Intel argued that Advanced Micro illegally uses the microcode
in a clone of an Intel 287 microprocessor. Advanced Micro
argues that it has the right to use Intel's microcode under a
1976 license from Intel.
   Advanced Micro, Sunnyvale, Calif., asked the Texas judge
last year to send the 386 case to California, arguing that
the case didn't raise new legal issues and was filed to
intimidate potential buyers of Advanced Micro's chips. Intel,
Santa Clara, Calif., said it filed the suit in Texas to
ensure a speedier trial than it would have gotten in
California.
