Business Brief -- McDonald  Co. Investments:
   Concern Expects Period Net
   To Keep Up Year's Pace
For the nine months ended Dec. 31, the Cleveland
investment banking and brokerage concern earned $7.3 million,
or $1.25 a share, compared with net of $1.8 million, or 33
cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings for the year-earlier
nine months included an extraordinary gain of $1.2 million,
or 22 cents a share, from repurchase of debentures.
   Revenue for fiscal 1992 will exceed $120 million, Mr.
Summers said, which would be about a 50% rise from $81
million in fiscal 1991. The company earned $3.9 million, or
72 cents a share, in fiscal 1991, including the gain of 22
cents a share from debenture repurchases.
   Mr. Summers was interviewed following a presentation to
Cleveland securities analysts.
   He credited the strong stock market for much of the
company's growth in sales and earnings, but he said the
company had been restructuring for two years before the 1991
market upturn, preparing to maximize profits when markets
improved.
