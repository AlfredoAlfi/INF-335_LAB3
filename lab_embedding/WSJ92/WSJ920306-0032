Apple Computer and IRS
   Agree to Arbitrate Dispute
At stake is about $100 million, according to Eric Ryan,
Apple's director of taxes. The disagreement involves the
amount of money the computer giant charged its offshore
manufacturers for goods and services in the 1984, 1985 and
1986 tax years.
   The IRS believes that multinational companies often sell
products and services to their U.S. affiliates at high
markups to limit the profitability of the U.S. affiliate and,
therefore, the amount of taxes paid in the U.S.
   The arbitration panel, whose decision will be binding,
will consist of a retired federal judge, an economist and a
computer-industry expert.
   Mr. Ryan said that arbitration will start in mid-1993 and
that it will take roughly two months to reach a decision.
That's in stark contrast to tax disputes that end up in court
and can take several months to resolve.
   Arbitration has long been used in commercial circles, such
as in disputes over baseball salaries. But given the huge
backlog of tax cases, it could become a more favored means of
resolving tax matters.
