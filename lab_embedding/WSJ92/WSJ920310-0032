Northwest Air's Traffic Rises
Northwest said the traffic gain reflects in part the "very
low traffic levels Northwest and the rest of the industry
experienced" a year ago. It said it sees the increase as part
of a "slow, but encouraging, strengthening in overall
passenger demand."
   For the year to date, Northwest's traffic climbed 19% to
8.33 billion revenue passenger miles from 6.97 billion a year
ago. Load factor rose to 59.6% from 57.4%.
