Business Brief -- United Technologies Corp.:
   `Poison Pill' Holder Rights
   To Be Redeemed March 10
Of the shareholder rights plan, the spokesman said, "We
don't need this anymore." The environment for corporate
takeovers today has changed from six years ago, he said, when
availability of credit and creative financing made hostile
acquisitions more likely.
   United Technologies will redeem the rights March 10 to
shareholders of record Feb. 28. The rights plan would have
expired in 1996.
   Separately, its Pratt  Whitney unit said it will lay off
118 blue-collar workers at its East Hartford, Conn., plant,
where 1,400 are employed.
