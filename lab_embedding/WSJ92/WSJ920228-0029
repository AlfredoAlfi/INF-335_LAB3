Business Brief -- Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd.:
   Mining Company Reports
   Profit Rose 20% in 1st Half
Renison said the improvement in profit mainly is due to a
full six months' contribution from the new Porgera gold mine
in Papua New Guinea, in which the company has a 30% stake.
Porgera contributed A$63.6 million to pretax earnings, up
from A$24.7 million a year earlier.
   This contribution offset a decline in earnings from
mineral sands, caused by continuing poor market conditions.
The company's other major mining operations reported improved
results for the half.
   Directors warned that "business conditions will be more
difficult in the second half," anticipating lower grades at
Porgera and the continuation of depressed prices for its
major commodities.
