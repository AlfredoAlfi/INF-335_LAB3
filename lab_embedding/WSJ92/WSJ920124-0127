BNL Issues Profit Estimate
   Amid Probe on Iraq Loans
   ----
   Special to The Wall Street Journal
Separately, the committee's chairman, Sen. Gianuiario
Carta, said the inquiry could still come up with "some
surprises" before concluding by the end of March. He didn't
elaborate.
   BNL's branch in Atlanta extended $4 billion in
unauthorized loans to Iraq in the late 1980s before being
discovered by U.S. authorities. BNL has said the loans were
made without the knowledge of its Rome headquarters or North
American management in New York and has blamed the scandal on
the branch manager, Christopher Drogoul.
   A criminal trial of Mr. Drogoul is scheduled to begin in
U.S. federal court in Atlanta on March 2.
