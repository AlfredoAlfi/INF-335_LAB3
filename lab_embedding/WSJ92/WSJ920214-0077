Winter Olympics 1992:
   Television Highlights
   ----
   By Kevin Goldman
Speed skater Bonnie Blair's attempt to win a second
Albertville gold medal, this time in the 1,000 meters, will
be featured on CBS tonight. She won the 500 meters, but
finished out of the money in the 1,500-meter race.
   The prime-time show also will feature the favorites in the
ice-dancing competition, the brother-sister team of Isabelle
and Paul Duchesnay of France, who will skate to the theme
from "2001."
   This weekend CBS has a total of 17 1/2 hours of coverage.
On Saturday, medals will be decided in men's figure skating.
                                                                                                       

   Ratings Slip a Bit
                                                                                                       

   On Wednesday, CBS attracted 16.7% of U.S. homes with TV
sets, according to national ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co. NBC
was watched by 13.1% and ABC lagged behind with 9.1%. CBS's
five-night average for the Olympics is 19.1%. (CBS guaranteed
advertisers an average of 17%.) Four years ago, ABC's
five-night average for the Winter Olympics was 18.6%.
                                                                                                       

   Breathtaking Shots
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday may have had the lowest ratings, but it had the
most exciting coverage to date, of the women's combined
downhill. The footage included breathtaking shots of the
skiers speeding down the mountain -- both coming at the
camera and going away. The camera was mounted on a gate and
activated by the sound of the skier's approach.
   Even co-hosts Paula Zahn and Tim McCarver are finally
jelling.
