Business Brief -- First Interstate Bancorp.:
   Standard Chartered to Buy
   Foreign Operations of Bank
The proposed deal, whose estimated value was not
disclosed, would leave First Interstate, one of the largest
bank holding companies in the U.S., with only a small office
abroad, a trading operation in London. In the early 1980s,
First Interstate had more than 40 offices abroad.
   Under the terms of the proposed deal, Standard Chartered,
which has assets of $44 billion and employs 28,000 people,
would acquire offices in 17 countries that employ 700 people
and specialize in trade finance, correspondent banking,
global trading and related operations.
   The two banking companies also said they expect to form a
business-development partnership that will provide
opportunities to expand business in each other's markets.
