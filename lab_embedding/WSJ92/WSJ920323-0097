Credit Ratings
ATLANTA GAS LIGHT Co. (Atlanta) -- Standard  Poor's Corp.
raised its rating on $125 million of this utility's senior
unsecured debt (medium-term notes) to single-A-minus from
triple-B-plus. The agency also assigned a preliminary rating
of single-A-minus to $300 million of debt securities,
registered under Rule 415 shelf registration a week ago.
Ratings were affirmed on first mortgage bonds outstanding at
single-A-minus, preferred stock at triple-B-plus, and
commercial paper at single-A-2. At the end of 1991, the
utility had about $612 million of debt outstanding. SP said
the higher rating for senior unsecured debt reflects the
company's agreement not to issue additional first mortgage
bonds.
