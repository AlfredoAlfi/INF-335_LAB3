International Brief -- Exor S.A.:
   Arab Banking Corp. Holds
   Perrier Stake, Agnelli Says
His remark refuted speculation that Arab Banking Corp. was
backing the Agnellis' fight against Nestle S.A., BSN S.A. and
Cie. Financiere de Suez S.A.
   Mr. Agnelli, chairman of IFIL S.p.A., one of the two key
holding companies of the powerful Agnelli family, which
controls car maker Fiat S.p.A., also predicted that the
battle for control of Source Perrier will be long.
   The Agnellis, together with allies, have made bids for
French holding company Exor S.A. and Exor's Perrier unit;
hostile counterbids have been made by Nestle and its allies.
