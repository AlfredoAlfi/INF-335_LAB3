International:
   Chase Offers Mexico Loan,
   The First Since Debt Crisis
Bankers say their interest in financing Mexico reflects
the turnaround in the Mexican economy and the booming
financial markets. Since the debt crisis, bank financing for
the affiliates of Mexico had been guaranteed by the U.S.
Export-Import Bank.
   "We feel very comfortable with Mexico," said Manuel
Pena-Morros, Chase's senior officer for the Pemex loan, first
reported by the trade publication American Banker. Pemex,
which recently raised $150 million in the Euromarkets,
carries the same Ba-2 rating as Mexico from Moody's Investors
Service Inc.
