Business Brief -- Kirin Brewery Co.:
   Firm Posts Pretax Profit
   Of $676.2 Million for '91
For 1992, Kirin Brewery expects unconsolidated pretax
profit to edge up 0.6% to 87 billion yen. Net is pegged at 37
billion yen, up 0.8%. The company forecasts a 4.9% rise in
unconsolidated sales to 1.38 trillion yen.
   In 1991, Kirin sales declined as the company transferred
its soft drink businesses to a joint venture with Tropicana
Products Inc., Bradenton, Fla., a U.S. unit of Seagram Co.,
Montreal, at the beginning of the year. The joint venture,
Kirin Beverage Corp., is marketing orange juice and other
Tropicana products. Beer and other divisions showed sales
gains to counter the decline, however.
   Beer division sales accounted for 98% of total sales at
1.284 trillion yen, a 6.4% increase from 1.207 trillion yen
the year before.
   Per-share net slipped because of an increase in the number
of shares outstanding to 1,052,448 as of Dec. 31 from
1,002,325 a year earlier.
