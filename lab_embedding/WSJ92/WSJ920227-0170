International:
   Barclays Pretax Profit
   Fell 30% Last Year;
   Operating Costs Rose
Despite the poor profit figure, Barclays said it would pay
an unchanged dividend of 21.2 pence a share, part of which
will have to be financed by drawing on reserves. Barclays
shares fell 20 pence yesterday to finish at 374 pence in late
trading on the London Stock Exchange.
   Barclays Chairman Sir John Quinton, commenting on the
increase in operating costs, said the bank is investing to
expand in profitable business areas. He cited extra costs
associated with the acquisitions last year of Europeenne de
Banque in France and Merck Finck  Co., a German private
bank, and spending on improvements in the bank's technology
base.
   Analysts said they were disappointed both by the rise in
costs and by the poor results in some of the bank's main
markets, notably Britain and the U.S., where Barclays
reported a loss of #217 million, against a profit in 1990 of
#20 million.
   Barclays reduced its U.K. labor force by 5,100 during the
year to 79,400 and closed 110 branches. The bank said further
staff cuts and branch closures are expected during the year,
in line with a target announced last year of reductions of
15,000 jobs over a five-year span.
   Barclays' investment-banking unit, Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Ltd., reported a sharp increase in profits in 1991, to #61
million from #5 million in 1990.
