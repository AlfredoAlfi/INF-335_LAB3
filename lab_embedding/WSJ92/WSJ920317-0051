International Brief -- Fokker N.V.:
   Stake of 6.02% Is Owned
   By Finmeccanica of Italy
Under a new Dutch law, any person or institution that
holds a stake in a publicly traded corporation must disclose
its holding if it exceeds 5% of the shares outstanding.
Finmeccanica declined to say when it acquired the
shareholding.
   Market sources speculated that an agreement might be in
the works between Fokker, which produces midsized airplanes,
and Finmeccanica's aeronautics unit Alenia S.p.A., which is
involved in a commuter airplane project with Aerospatiale
S.A. of France called Avions de Transport Regional. Alenia,
Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace of Germany are also
working on the development of a regional, 100-seat,
twin-engine jet.
