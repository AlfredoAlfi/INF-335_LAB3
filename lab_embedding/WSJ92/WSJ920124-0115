American Red Cross Faces
   Big Deficit in Relief Fund
The organization's fiscal year ends in June and it is
still facing the flood and tornado seasons, a spokesman said.
"We'll continue to operate and provide disaster relief,
although it will be jeopardized," he said.
   During the last fiscal year, the Red Cross said it
experienced its worst year in history in terms of the number
of major disasters it faced, providing national assistance
for more than 8,000 victims of disasters. Red Cross disaster
relief in fiscal 1990-91 totaled $184 million. In the prior
year ended in June 1990, though, it paid out even more in
relief, $224 million. That period included Hurricane Hugo in
the southeastern U.S. and the northern California earthquake.
   Already in the first six months of 1992, the agency said
it has responded to such major disasters as the Oakland Hills
fire in California, the New England coastal storms and severe
flooding in Texas.
