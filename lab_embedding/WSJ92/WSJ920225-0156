   Most-Despised Taxes
   In Philadelphia Arsenal
I believe the financiers of Wall Street would look
favorably on such an action as a first step toward stopping
the flight of businesses out of Philadelphia and stabilizing
our business tax base.

   For nonresidents employed in Philadelphia, the City
Council has caused the saying "no taxation without
representation" to become merely a frivolous Revolutionary
War slogan. You stated, "The average Scranton family pays
nearly $1,000 a year in city taxes alone. . . . The result .
. . has been `to chase business and people out of the city.'
" I can assure you that I am fairly average, and I paid a lot
more than $1,000 to Philadelphia each year; if one questions
whether or not it drives people away, just look at my return
address.
