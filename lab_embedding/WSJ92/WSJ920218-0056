Arnold Palmer-Led Group
   Ousts ProGroup's Directors
ProGroup is a golf equipment and sportswear concern that
has exclusive North American rights to market equipment under
Mr. Palmer's name. In recent years, however, the golfer, who
holds a 10% stake in the company, has grown disenchanted with
ProGroup. In late January, he and several other major holders
launched a proxy fight against the concern.
   As previously reported, Mr. Palmer was motivated at least
in part by his royalty arrangement with ProGroup, which has
provided him with only $50,000 a year, no matter what the
company's sales. The agreement was to expire in the year
2002.
   The shareholder group led by Mr. Palmer has said it plans
to renegotiate a contract with him that would increase his
pay and would include new international marketing rights.
   Among the six new board members are Arthur Becker, a Bear,
Stearns  Co. associate director; two top former executives
of Wilson Sporting Goods Co.; and Mr. Palmer. The new board
takes control immediately.
   Officials at ProGroup couldn't be reached for comment.
