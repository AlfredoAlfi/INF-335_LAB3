   Deprenyl, Canguard
   May Have Reached
   A Truce Over Drug
Deprenyl said Canguard and Pharmascience had requested
that Deprenyl delay proceedings to give them more time to
prepare their response to Deprenyl's legal action. But Morton
Shulman, founder and co-chairman of Deprenyl, said that the
agreement satisfies his claims against the Canguard group,
and that it's possible the matter might not arise again.
   Deprenyl said the Canguard group has said it will refrain
from marketing the drug, using it in clinical trials or
seeking any government approvals of it.
   But Canguard said yesterday that it has only agreed to
these conditions for a 30-day period, while it attempts to
reach a permanent out-of-court settlement with Deprenyl.
Canguard, a Vancouver, British Columbia, pharmaceutical
concern, said the two parties can take the issue back to the
courts on three days' notice.
   The dispute surfaced last November when Canguard announced
it was preparing to seek approval for its own drug.
Toronto-based Deprenyl fired back in December, filing a suit
that alleged Canguard had infringed on its patent on the
process to manufacture the drug. Deprenyl markets the drug
under the name Eldepryl.
