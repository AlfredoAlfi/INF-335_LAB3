Business Brief -- Volmac Software Groep N.V.:
   Profit Fell by 7.2% in 1991
   As Results Top Prediction
However, the company had warned investors as recently as
December that its 1991 results could be as much as 15% below
the year-earlier level. Volmac was able to avoid its more
pessimistic forecast for its 1991 results because of an
exceptionally strong second half.
   Sales rose 3.5% to 598.4 million guilders from 578.2
million guilders.
   The company declined to issue a forecast for 1992,
although it said it plans to continue to shift more of its
activities into providing computer services to customers and
to limit the growth in its work force.
