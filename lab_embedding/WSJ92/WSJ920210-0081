Morrison Knudson
   Reports 49% Decline
   In Fourth-Period Net
The results are a direct consequence of the company's
decision in 1988 to go after smaller, lower-risk projects
that are less profitable, said spokesman Doug Brigham.
Margins on engineering and construction projects were 2.7% in
the quarter, down from 5.3% a year ago. Operating income in
the just-ended quarter was down 34% to $14.7 million from
$22.4 million.
   William Agee, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement that profit in 1992 will be higher than in
1991 but added that "most of the improvement will occur in
the last half of the year."
   For 1991, Morrison earned $35.1 million, or $2.60 a share,
down 3.7% from $36.5 million, or $2.93 a share, in 1990.
Annual revenue climbed 16% to $1.98 billion from $1.71
billion.
   The company cushioned Friday's bad news by increasing its
quarterly payout 8% to 40 cents, up from 37 cents, and
pointing out that its order backlog stood at a record $4.25
billion, which it expects to climb further in the first
quarter. Also, the board approved a 2-for-1 stock split,
subject to shareholder approval.
