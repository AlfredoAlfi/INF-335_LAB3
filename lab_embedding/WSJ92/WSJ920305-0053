Business Brief -- Public Service Co. of New Mexico:
   Utility Settles All Lawsuits
   By Holders for $33 Million
According to company documents, the first shareholder suit
was filed in September 1989 in U.S. District Court in New
Mexico. Later, a second holder joined the suit. The suit
alleged breaches in fiduciary duties, mismanagement and waste
by 11 current or former directors and officers. The suit said
they caused the company to make questionable investments and
exposed it to liability for securities fraud.
   The pact was reached after all parties consented to the
jurisdiction of Judge Harry McCue of U.S. District Court of
Southern California for the purpose of settlement talks.
