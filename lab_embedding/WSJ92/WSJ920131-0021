Business Brief -- Revco D.S. Inc.:
   Reorganization Is Sweetened
   With Zell/Chilmark Offer
Revco Chairman Boake A. Sells said, in a statement,
management has "had indications of support from its creditor
consituencies." Spokesmen for several creditor groups
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Under the new arrangement, Zell/Chilmark will pay holders
of subordinated notes and unsecured claims $7.47 a share in
lieu of shares they would get in a reorganized Revco. In
return for putting up the cash, Zell/Chilmark, a so-called
vulture fund run by investor Sam Zell, will own stock in the
reorganized company.
   A spokesman for Zell/Chilmark, Chicago, says the move
"facilitates getting Revco out of bankruptcy and gives
creditors who might not want to hold stock an opportunity to
convert to cash."
   Eckerd Chairman Stu Turley said, "we still believe the
Eckerd plan offers superior value to all Revco creditors."
