   Stanford Picks Its President
   From University of Chicago
Mr. Casper headed the University of Chicago's law school
until becoming provost in 1987. He was a leading candidate
last year to become president of Harvard. He also helped the
University of Chicago deal with serious budget problems
caused by allegations it too overbilled on federal contracts.
Stanford officials said he was the unanimous choice from more
than 500 candidates for the top job at Palo Alto.
   President Donald Kennedy announced he was stepping down
last July, after the overbilling charges became public. His
resignation becomes effective Aug. 31. He said he will return
to the Stanford faculty and teach biology.
