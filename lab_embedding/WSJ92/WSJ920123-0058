Heilig-Meyers Expects
   Fiscal Year Revenue,
   Profit to Hit Record
In the year-ago fourth quarter, Heilig-Meyers earned 25
cents a share, or $4 million, restated to reflect a 3-for-2
stock split earlier this month. Revenue totaled $114.2
million.
   For the year, management is comfortable with analysts'
estimates the company will earn $1.40 to $1.42 a share, or a
total of a little more than $26 million. That compares with
year-ago restated earnings of $1.16 a share, or $18.3
million, including a charge of $2.5 million, or 16 cents a
share, for an accounting change.
   Revenue for the year is expected to reach about $505
million to $510 million, compared with $447.8 million in the
previous year.
   "We bring a major sophisticated advertising approach to
small town America," said William C. DeRusha, chairman and
chief executive officer. The company, which feeds its 374
stores from four distribution centers, relies heavily on
direct mail circulars to generate sales. It mails circulars
to about 5.6 million households a month, and also does about
1.2 million mailings a month to preferred customers.
