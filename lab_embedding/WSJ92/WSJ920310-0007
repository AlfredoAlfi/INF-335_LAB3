International:
   British Panel Urges Change
   In Pension-Fund Controls

   Special to The Wall Street Journal
"Change in the law is urgent," the Select Committee on
Social Security said in a 95-page report. "The first task is
to ensure that current {Maxwell} pensions continue to be
paid, and those who have already lost their pensions have
those pensions reinstated."
   On Friday, more than 8,000 people who worked for Maxwell
companies were told their pensions would end in July because
Mirror Group Newspapers PLC no longer can support them. The
panel blamed regulators for letting $720 million be drained
from the funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell. The
missing money was used to prop up Mr. Maxwell's ailing media
empire.
   Bishopsgate Investment Management, the main Maxwell
company that managed pension funds for 32,000 employees and
pensioners, should have had a total of #695 million ($1.19
billion) in assets, said provisional liquidator Neil Cooper,
who has said he has secured 237 million pounds of the total.
