Cost of OSHA Rules Affects
   Health, Budget Office Says
Mr. MacRae's argument, quickly criticized as unrealistic
by union and some Labor Department officials, would dilute a
1981 Supreme Court ruling that said the government can't kill
health regulations simply because of their cost. Under the
theory, the administration might kill rules on the ground
that their very cost would have adverse health consequences.
Even so, the theory still could run afoul of the high court
decision because it would involve evaluating health
regulations according to cost.
   The letter from Mr. MacRae, which was first disclosed by
the New York Times, wasn't directly related to the Bush
administration's current moratorium on many federal
regulations.
