Japanese Investment
   In Midwest Increased
   At Slower Pace in '91
The six states included in the survey are Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Many Japanese firms own more than one facility in the
Midwest. The number of Japanese companies in the six-state
survey rose 7.1% to 1,011 from 944 in 1990.
   oichi Nemoto, consul for economic affairs at the Chicago
consulate, attributed the slower investment pace to the U.S.
recession and a tighter supply of credit in Japan, among
other things.
   The survey detected a shift in the types of
Japanese-associated manufacturing in the Midwest. Among other
things, the survey found a smaller number of tire, rubber and
precision instrument facilities.
   Meanwhile, the number of Japanese facilities used to make
industrial machinery and non-consumer electronics increased
by 28%. The number of chemical facilities grew 88%, metal
operations increased 12% and consumer electronics facilities
rose 10%.
   The consulate said that Japanese firms had a six-state
payroll of 133,000 workers last year, up 1.7% from 1990.
