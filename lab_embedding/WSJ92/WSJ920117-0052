fully diluted basis.
   For the first quarter ending Feb. 16, the company expects
to report net income of about $8.4 million, or 20 cents a
share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $6.1 million,
or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue is expected to
rise about 8.5% to 9%, to about $299 million to $300 million.
   "We've had a dramatic turn-around in same-store sales,"
said Leonard H. Roberts, chairman and chief executive
officer. In the past two months, sales in restaurants open at
least one year rose 3.8%.
