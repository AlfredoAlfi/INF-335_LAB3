U.S. Asks Japan in Talks
   To Remove Trade Barriers
Indicating areas of greatest concern, the U.S. team handed
over case studies on several Japanese markets, including
those for feed grains, flat glass, auto parts and insurance.
U.S. officials said this was the first time agricultural
trade was discussed in this forum.
   The U.S. side also sought increased Japanese efforts to
liberalize their distribution systems and pricing mechanisms.
For their part, the Japanese submitted case studies of
foreign companies successfully establishing footholds in
Japan.
   James Rill, assistant attorney general for antitrust,
conceded that Tokyo had made some improvements in its
enforcement of Japan's anti-monopoly law. He added, however,
that Japan should do more to prevent close-knit corporate
relationships called keiretsu from unduly hindering foreign
trade.
