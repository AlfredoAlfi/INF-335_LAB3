The company said while it was the 30th consecutive year
the board has approved a rise in Coke's dividend, the current
increase of 17% was nearly twice the average increase of the
last 10 years. The dividend is payable April 1 to
shareholders of record March 15.
   If the stock split, requiring an increase in authorized
shares, is approved by shareholders, additional shares would
be distributed around May 11, the company said. The split
would apply to stock held by shareholders of record May 1.
Shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split in May 1990 and a
3-for-1 split in June 1986.
