Business Brief -- Tredegar Industries Inc.:
   Fourth-Quarter Net Income
   Of $2.1 Million Is Posted
The year-ago quarter included a charge of $13.7 million,
related primarily to divestitures, reorganization, legal and
environmental activities. Without the charge, Tredegar would
have posted a loss of $4.2 million, or 37 cents a share, for
the year-ago quarter.
   For the year, Tredegar posted net of $5.6 million, or 52
cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $24.7
million, or $2.19 a share, following charges after-tax of
$27.7 million. Without the charges Tredegar would have had
net income for the year of $3 million, or 26 cents a share.
Sales fell 13%, to $474 million, as the company restructured
and sold or closed some businesses, and as a result of the
economy, a spokesman said.
