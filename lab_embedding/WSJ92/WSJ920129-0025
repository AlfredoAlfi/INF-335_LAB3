Business Brief -- Southland Communications Inc.:
   Ex-President to Disgorge
   Profits of Alleged Scheme
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a 1990 lawsuit,
accused Mr. Bayaa and five others of attempting to boost
Southland stock by "creating the false illusion of widespread
market interest." Southland, based in Santa Ana, Calif.,
leases pagers. Its shares are currently quoted in the "pink
sheets" for thinly traded stocks, said Mr. Bayaa.
   According to Mr. Bayaa, Southland, which operates under
the name National Paging, did about $6 million of business
last year. Mr. Bayaa said he is still employed by the company
and he owns 920,000 of its more than two million shares.
   As part of his SEC agreement, Mr. Bayaa must place his
Southland stock into a custodial account over which he has no
control. He will regain control of the stock after disgorging
the $736,000 in profits and $140,000 in interest. He also is
barred for 18 months from serving as a director or officer of
a publicly traded company.
