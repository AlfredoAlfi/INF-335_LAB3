Countrywide Credit
   Reports Sharp Jump
   In Quarterly Profit
The earnings completed a record year for the independent
residential mortgage banker, fueled by low interest rates and
a resultant rash of home refinancings. In New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, Countrywide shares closed at
$33.375, down 50 cents.
   With three equity offerings in this last fiscal year,
Countrywide's number of shares outstanding increased to 27
million from 17.6 million.
   For fiscal 1992, the company posted net income of $60.2
million, or $2.09 a share, up sharply from $22.3 million, or
$1.13 a share, in 1991. Revenue increased 82% to $246.1
million from $135 million.
   The company said its loan originations for the fourth
quarter were $4.6 billion, up 36% from the third quarter. The
company's loan servicing portfolio ended the year at $27.5
billion, nearly double that of a year ago.
   The servicing portfolio is designed to function
countercyclically to the company's loan originations.
