Who's News:
   Tambrands' Chapman
   Is Named President
   And Operating Chief
Mr. Emmett, 57, will continue as chairman and chief
executive officer. The post of operating chief had been
vacant since John F. Bard left the company in August 1989,
one of several top management changes that year. Mr. Emmett,
a former investment banker, joined the company as chairman
earlier in 1989, after his predecessor abruptly resigned.
   In one of his first major appointments, Mr. Emmett hired
Mr. Chapman. Prior to joining the marketer of Tampax tampons,
Mr. Chapman had been a principal in Spectrum Group, an
investment firm. He resigned in 1987 as president of Nabisco
Brands North America, a RJR Nabisco Inc. unit, after a
realignment of the unit.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Tambrands shares rose $1 to $64.375.
