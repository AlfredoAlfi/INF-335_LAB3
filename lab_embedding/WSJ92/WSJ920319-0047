International Brief -- ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG:
   Profit Was Little Changed
   At $1.15 Billion Last Year
Separately, Asea AB, the Swedish group that owns 50% of
ABB, said pretax profit after financial items rose 7.8% last
year. It proposed a dividend of 7 kronor ($1.17) a share,
down 46% from 13 kronor a year earlier, though the payouts
aren't comparable because the 1990 figure included both Asea
and Incentive, into which Asea spun off its operations in
restructuring to be a holding company for the ABB stake.
   Percy Barnevik, ABB's president and chief executive,
called the results satisfactory in light of the recession
affecting about 60% of the company's markets. Growth in
Germany and Asia helped offset declines in orders from some
recession-affected markets, he said.
   Forecasting that 1992 results would stay around 1991
levels, Mr. Barnevik said ABB anticipated a somewhat slow
recovery this year in markets hit by the recession.
