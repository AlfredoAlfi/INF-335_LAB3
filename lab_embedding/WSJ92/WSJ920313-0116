Business Brief -- Henkel KGaA:
   German Chemicals Company
   Posts 3.3% Rise in '91 Net
Henkel said 1991 had been a successful year, and all of
its operations had contributed to the rise in sales. The
group said its sales were particularly strong in the domestic
market, where they rose 12%, and in the rest of Europe, where
they increased 10%. Sales outside of Europe rose only 1%.
   Results included one-time write-offs in the U.S. and
Yugoslavia. The company said its Henkel-Ecolab hygiene
products joint venture with Ecolab Inc. of the U.S. had
gotten off to a good start, but didn't provide specific
figures. The joint venture was established in July.
   The company said it employed 41,405 workers world-wide at
the end of 1991, up 6.7% from 38,803 the year before.
   Henkel predicted another "positive" result for 1992,
despite difficult economic circumstances in many of its
markets.
