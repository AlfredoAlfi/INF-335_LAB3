Business Brief -- Rockwell International Corp.:
   NASA Lifts Its Suspension
   Of Company's Collins Unit
The suspension had been imposed last November following
the division's indictment on fraud charges. Collins is
alleged to have overbilled NASA for many years for production
and repair work on the space shuttle by padding employee time
cards. The 15-count indictment, handed up by a Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, grand jury, accuses Rockwell of conspiracy, mail and
wire fraud, and false claims. Rockwell has pleaded innocent
in the case.
