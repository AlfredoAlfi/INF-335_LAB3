Credit Ratings:
   Minnesota PL Debt
   Totaling $588 Million
   Is Downgraded by SP
The rating concern noted that the Duluth, Minn., company
owns half of a $400 million paper mill and recently announced
an 88% stake in a planned $70 million recycled-paper
facility. "Since part of the company's strategy is to invest
in its service territory," SP said, "future investments may
be in the paper and taconite industries."
   SP said that despite benefits derived from power sales to
such businesses, "Minnesota Power increases its exposure to
the economic cycles of these two industries." The agency also
cited the utility's plans to expand its water and wastewater
properties. SP said those areas have prospects for long-term
profitability but that "short-term results have been weak due
to aggressive environmental spending and lack of rate
relief."
   Minnesota Power's senior secured debt was marked down to
single-A-minus from single-A, and its preferred stock was
downgraded to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. SP affirmed
the company's A-1 commercial paper rating.
