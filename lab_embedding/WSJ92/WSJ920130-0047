Business Brief -- Katy Industries Inc.:
   Subsidiaries Settle Litigation
   Over Waste-to-Energy Plant
Under terms of the settlement, Katy said it received a
payment of $850,000 from the Davis County Solid Waste
Management and Energy Recovery Special Service District, the
owner of the facility. In addition, the two have agreed to
terminate the long-term operating and maintenance contract
between a Katy unit and the Special Service District. Katy
said termination of the contract would relieve it of future
losses expected in operating the facility over the remaining
16-plus years of the contract.
   Katy has interests in consumer products, industrial
machinery and energy resources.
