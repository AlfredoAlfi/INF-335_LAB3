UPI Union Workers
   Approve Givebacks
   To Help Company
The 84-year-old news service said the agreement modifies
five contract articles involving issues ranging from
severance pay for laid-off workers to the use of stringers as
correspondents.
   The articles were suspended Sept. 23 by U.S. Bankruptcy
Court Judge Francis Conrad in New York.
   Pieter VanBennekom, UPI president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement, "This removes a major obstacle
on our path to long-term viability because the contract
modifications accepted today will allow UPI to control its
labor costs.
   "The vote underscores the sacrifices Unipressers and the
Wire Service Guild are willing to make to keep UPI a major
force in international journalism."
   UPI filed for protection from creditors in bankruptcy
court last August, and the company has been given a March 3
deadline to file a reorganization plan. Its parent company,
Infotechnology Inc., also sought bankruptcy protection last
year.
   Mr. VanBennekom said in October the company's goal was to
reach the financial break-even point by the end of the year.
Mr. Rossiter said December figures were not yet available, so
the company couldn't say whether it had met the goal.
   Wire Service Guild officials couldn't be reached.
