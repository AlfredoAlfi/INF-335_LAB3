Campeau Restructuring
   Survives `Lost Ballot' Vote
Campeau officials said National Trust Co., which
scrutinized the vote, apologized for losing Mr. Campeau's
ballot "in their system." National Trust officials couldn't
be reached for comment. The company is the operating unit of
National Trustco Inc., Toronto.
   Under the plan, shareholders and creditors would exchange
their holdings for new shares in the company, which would be
renamed Camdev Corp. Mr. Campeau would be removed from the
board and would see his equity stake drop to below 2%. He
held 54% of the once-powerful real estate and retailing
concern less than two years ago.
   The restructuring plan is still subject to court approval.
It's also conditional on Campeau's Federated and Allied
retailing subsidiaries in the U.S. emerging from Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection, which could happen as soon as
next month.
