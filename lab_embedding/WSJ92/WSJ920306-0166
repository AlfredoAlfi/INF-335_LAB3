Air Reservation Systems
   Announce Plans to Merge
Officials of the two systems said they signed a letter of
intent and plan to complete a definitive pact "as soon as
possible." They said they expect to clear regulatory hurdles
by the year end.
   Covia, based in Rosemont, Ill., was formed in 1976 as
United Airline's Apollo Services division. It is the
second-largest travel reservation system after Sabre Travel
Information Network, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines. Covia was one of the founding partners of
the Galileo system, based in Swindon, England, along with
British Airways, Swissair, KLM and Alitalia. A combined
Galileo and Covia would most likely be larger than Sabre.
   United, a unit of UAL Corp., would have a 38% share in the
new Galileo International; British Airways, 15%; Swissair,
13%; KLM, 12%; USAir Group, 11%; and Alitalia, 9%. Stakes of
1% or less would be held by Belgium's Sabena, Greece's
Olympic Airways, Air Canada, Ireland's Aer Lingus, Austrian
Airlines and TAP Air Portugal.
