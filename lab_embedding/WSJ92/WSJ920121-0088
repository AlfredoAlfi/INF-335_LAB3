Notable  Quotable
Rich is drawn to question certain distinct kinds of social
evil. A natural "evil" like the Irish potato famine would not
interest her were its results not compounded by British
indifference and mismanagement. Such things as slavery,
marital brutality, racist persecution, social discrimination,
industrial crimes against health, and the conditions of
imprisonment are her natural territory (rather than, for
instance, the kinds of sophisticated moral evil that
interested Henry James or Proust). . . . {W}e do not, in
Rich, see the malathion-sickened migrant worker beating his
wife, or the murdered lesbian being indifferent to her sick
mother, or the black prisoner victimizing another prisoner.
