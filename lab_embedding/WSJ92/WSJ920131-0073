New York Bancorp to Fold
   ESOP, Give Workers Stock
New York Bancorp closed unchanged at $15.25 yesterday in
national over-the-counter trading.
   New York Bancorp said it expects to terminate the plan in
March, giving employees stock in the company three years
earlier than originally scheduled.
   ESOPs offer companies a way to place stock in friendly
hands and motivate employees. Companies also can shelter the
gains of selling stock to an ESOP from taxes.
   The plans can be more expensive to administer than other
profit-sharing programs. A study issued this month by the
ESOP Association, a Washington trade group, found public
companies spend about $167,000 a year on average to
administer ESOPs.
   New York Bancorp cited cost-savings as one reason it is
terminating its ESOP, but it wouldn't disclose the plan's
annual cost.
