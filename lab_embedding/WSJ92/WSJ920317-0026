the blood screening business in the fourth quarter came to
$16.8 million, up from $11.7 million a year earlier.

$22.11 a share, compared with 1990 net income of $6.8
million, or 40 cents a share. Revenue rose 51% to $118.5
million from $78.5 million in 1990.
   Separately, Chiron said it formed a new company with a
group of venture capital investors to concentrate on
discovering and developing cancer therepeutics using
biotechnology. Chiron said it will contribute $4 million in
cash and services and will own 42.8% of the capital stock in
the new company, Onyx Pharmaceuticals.
   Chiron stock fell 25 cents to close at $50.25 in national
