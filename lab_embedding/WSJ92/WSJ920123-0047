Business Brief -- Caterpillar Inc.:
   Loss of $318 Million Posted
   By Firm for Fourth Quarter
The Peoria, Ill., company said the latest quarter includes
pretax charges of $324 million for the "probable" closing of
its York., Pa., plant and consolidation of its Brazilian
operations, among other things. The company said in December
it would close the York parts plant unless it gets labor
concessions from the United Auto Workers union.
   Caterpillar has been embroiled in a bitter fight with the
UAW since a partial strike and lockout began at some of its
Illinois plants in early November. The company said the
effect on its 1991 results was "negligible," but added that
the dispute is "seriously clouding" its outlook for 1992.
   In New York, Moody's Investors Service said it lowered the
ratings of the long-term debt and commercial paper of
Caterpillar and its Caterpillar Financial Services unit. It
also said the long-term debt ratings were under review for
another possible downgrade. Moody's cited the "negative
impact" of the labor dispute on Caterpillar's earnings and
capital structure.
