Ernst  Young Told
   By Judge to Provide
   Data to U.S. Agency
"The court sees no reason why OTS should not be able to
investigate Ernst  Young and enforce the subpoena in this
case," federal Judge Royce Lamberth said in a 23-page
opinion.
   He further noted that 690 failed financial institutions
were audited by Ernst  Young or its predecessor firm.
"Accounting firms may have been responsible for many of the
abuses which have led to this country's savings-and-loan
crisis," the judge wrote, adding: ". . . the court will not
allow parties such as Ernst  Young to avoid even being
investigated."
   Judge Lamberth issued an order for the two sides to agree
within 10 days on the scope of the document review, and how
to provide the requested data. "We will begin the process of
negotiation while reviewing options for a stay and an
appeal," an Ernst  Young spokesman said.
   The thrift office has pursued, in particular, law firms
and accountants to recover losses at SLs where they
performed professional duties.
