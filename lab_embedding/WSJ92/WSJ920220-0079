Lippo Group Unit Cancels
   Its Bid for BCC Hong Kong
Though not all of the claims, amounting to $2.1 billion
Hong Kong dollars (US$270.7 million), have been
substantiated, Mr. Gleeson said they were enough to place BCC
Hong Kong's liabilities in excess of its assets. But he said
depositors could eventually receive as much as 75 cents for
each dollar they had placed with the bank when colony
regulators closed it on July 8, 1991.
   In its effort to sell BCC Hong Kong, the colonial
government relied heavily on assurances from Abu Dhabi, which
owns 77% of the parent BCCI, that it would cover all BCC Hong
Kong liabilities. But as evidence emerged showing the
magnitude of corruption within the world-wide banking group,
Abu Dhabi amended its guarantee, promising instead to cover
just US$25 million in unrecorded claims against the Hong Kong
unit.
