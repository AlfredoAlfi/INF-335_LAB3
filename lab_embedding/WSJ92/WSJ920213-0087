Credit Ratings:
   U.K. Insurers' Ratings
   Are Cut by Moody's
Moody's cut the rating for Royal Insurance, of London, to
single-A-3 from single-A-1. The agency also lowered the
strength ratings on the member companies in the Royal
Indemnity Co. intercompany reinsurance pool to single-A-3
from single-A-2, citing their reduced ability to rely on the
support of their parent companies in the U.K. Besides Royal
Indemnity, the pool members are American  Foreign Insurance
Co., Globe Indemnity Co., Milbank Insurance Co., Newark
Insurance Co., Royal Insurance Co. of America and Safeguard
Insurance Co. Moody's said the pool companies represent the
principal U.S. operations of Royal Insurance Holdings.
   Moody's lowered to double-A-2 from double-A-1 the rating
on General Accident, of Perth, Scotland.
