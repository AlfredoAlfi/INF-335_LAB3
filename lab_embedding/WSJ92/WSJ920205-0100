Letters to the Editor:
   Ulcer-Drug Study
   Ignores Real World
Most important, the study, which examined only eight
patients taking Zantac, is at variance with the majority of
well-designed studies examining this claimed interaction.
Taken together, these studies involved significantly large
numbers of patients, some of whom used larger doses of
alcohol.
   As a matter of good medical practice, patients should not
mix drugs and alcohol. However, while the study is of
interest, we question its significance based on its
mythology, the substantial body of evidence against its
hypothesis that has been previously published in the medical
literature, and Zantac's 11 years of clinical use in more
than 170 million patient treatments.
