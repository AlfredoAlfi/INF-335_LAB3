   Vanguard Cellular
   Joins Southwestern
   Bell, McCaw Venture
Cellular One Group, a venture of McCaw and Southwestern
Bell's Mobile Systems unit, was set up in May 1991 to
establish Cellular One as a national brand for cellular phone
service. Vanguard Cellular has been using the Cellular One
identity in 21 markets in nine eastern states.
   "We expect this partnership will accelerate the provision
of seamless, national service which will benefit both our
customers and the cellular industry," said Haynes Griffin,
president and chief executive of Vanguard Cellular Systems.
   Richard Lyons, executive director of Cellular One Group,
said the addition of Vanguard is an important step toward
building Cellular One into a national brand with common
service and technical standards. Nationwide standards and
brand identity, he said, will be necessary for carriers to
achieve substantially higher penetration rates. Cellular One
represents cellular phone carriers that compete with local
phone companies' cellular units.
   Earlier this week, GTE Corp. and three of the regional
Baby Bells announced plans to develop a rival nationwide
brand for cellular service provided by local telephone
companies.
