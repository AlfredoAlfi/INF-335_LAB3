Harsco Says Profit
   For Fourth Quarter
   Exceeded Estimates
Mr. Gambill said in an interview that Harsco expects 1992
earnings to equal or exceed last year's results "if there's a
general pick-up in the recession." Harsco makes industrial,
construction, commercial and defense products.
   Harsco expects to weather reductions in defense spending
this year and next as a result of sizable order backlogs for
military trucks and tank-like tracked vehicles. More than
half the orders are from overseas governments, including
Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Egypt and Taiwan. Mr. Gambill
said, "The market thinks poorly of defense stocks, and the
multiples are bad, but we're not affected that much."
   Harsco's defense unit is involved in pending legal matters
that, if resolved this year, could affect 1992 results. These
include a $62 million dispute with the Army over payment of
federal excise taxes and $125 million of claims Harsco filed
alleging defects in government contracts.
   Mr. Gambill said Harsco is completing three years of job
cuts at its York, Pa., tracked vehicle plant as a result of a
dropoff in orders. Employment is now at 1,800, down from
3,000, but up from a low of 1,500 in 1989-90. Company
employment worldwide is 11,500.
