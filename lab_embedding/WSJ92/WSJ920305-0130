   Speaker's Job More
   Than Just a Lot of Talk
Most speakers I know truly care about their audiences. You
seem to think that we are all in the business for the fees.
Believe me, anyone earning the fees we do deserves them. We
don't just show up at a banquet and "at the clink of a spoon
on a wine glass" turn it on. We are dedicated professionals.
