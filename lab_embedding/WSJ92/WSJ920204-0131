   Environmentalists --
   Buy Your Own Forests
Apparently all citizens should feel good about paying more
taxes to give affluent backpackers and hikers more land to
play in virtually without charge. (The nation already has 88
million acres of federal wilderness and 118 million more
acres managed as wilderness while being studied for permanent
designation, not to mention 43 million additional acres of
national parks.)
   The environmentalists' pleas for government subsidies are
no different from those made by business seeking government
help. Only arrogance prevents the environmentalists from
realizing that they, too, feed at the government trough.
