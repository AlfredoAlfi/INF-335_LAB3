Sales of Life Insurance
   Declined 2% Last Year
A year earlier, the survey of 600 companies found that in
1990 the face amount of life insurance sold rose 5% while
annual premiums rose 4%. In 1991, annual premiums dropped 4%.
   Life insurance sales have been dropping by other measures
for some time, however. The number of new policies dropped
last year for the eighth consecutive year to 13.4 million, a
5% decline.
   Individual annuity sales grew 10% during the year,
following similar gains in recent years. Variable-rate
annuity sales rose 25%; fixed annuity sales rose 4%.
