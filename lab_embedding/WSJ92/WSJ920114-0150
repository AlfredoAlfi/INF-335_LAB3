Business Brief:
   Gerber Products, Citing Slack Demand,
   To Revamp Its Cloth-Diaper Operation
Gerber cited cheaper foreign cloth and reduced
environmental concerns about disposable diapers for its
decision. For nearly 50 years the company has woven cloth
into diapers, but imported cotton has undercut the domestic
market. Now Gerber will buy cloth from foreign and domestic
suppliers and sew it into diapers.
   Diapers are expected to contribute only about $30 million
of revenue this fiscal year. The baby-food giant's total
fiscal 1991 revenue was $1.2 billion.
   The restructuring, the fifth in as many years, raises
questions about the future of Gerber's apparel operations,
said John M. McMillin, food analyst at Prudential Securities
Inc. "That part of the business continues to underperform,"
he said.
   When the cloth-diaper business took off in the late 1980s,
"Gerber couldn't keep up with demand," said Jack Mogavero,
chief executive officer of General Healthcare Corp.,
Piscataway, N.J., a major Gerber customer. But recently, such
disposable-diaper giants as Procter  Gamble Co. and
Kimberly-Clark Corp. have won back consumers, with discount
coupons and a campaign stressing that their products account
for a small percentage of solid waste.
