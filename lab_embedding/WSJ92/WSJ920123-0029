Business Brief -- Bell Atlantic Corp.:
   Net Rose 13% in Quarter;
   Charge Caused Yearly Loss
In the year, the loss was $222.7 million, or 53 cents a
share, compared with earnings of $1.31 billion, or $3.38 a
share, in 1990. Excluding the accounting charge, which
amounted to $3.94 a share, earnings were up slightly to $1.33
billion, or $3.41 a share. Revenue was down slightly to
$12.28 billion.
   The accounting charge was to catch up with accumulated
liabilities for retiree health benefits. Under a new
accounting rule, companies must start accruing such benefit
liabilities, rather than wait until the benefits are actually
paid before accounting for them. Bell Atlantic was among many
companies that decided to take the charge before 1993.
   Bell Atlantic closed yesterday at $47, up 75 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
