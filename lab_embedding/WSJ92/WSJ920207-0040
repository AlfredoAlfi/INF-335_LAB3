Business Brief -- Telefonica de Espana:
   Agreement Set to Buy 80%
   Of Company in Puerto Rico
Telefonica Larga Distancia was created by the Puerto Rico
Telephone Authority in 1989 as a way to get into the
long-distance market but was unprofitable. The telephone
company had captured 33% of the long-distance market on the
island but had only 1% of the traffic coming into the U.S.
commonwealth.
   The agreement is expected to close in two to three months,
pending regulatory approvals.
