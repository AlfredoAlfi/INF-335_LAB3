Who's News:
   Muhlenberg College Picks
   Arthur Taylor as President
He is a former president and chief operating officer of
CBS Inc. and executive vice president and chief financial
officer of International Paper Co.
   Jonathan C. Messerli, the college's current president,
will retire this summer, after eight years in the post. He
had announced retirement plans this past May.
   The college, founded in 1848, has about 1,650 students.
   At Fordham, Mr. Taylor strengthened the business school
faculty and enrollment, boosted the endowment, and focused
the curriculum on such issues as total quality management.
The business school provides a number of graduates in the
accounting and finance fields.
   It was understood that Muhlenberg had been pursuing Mr.
Taylor for some time. News of his resignation was greeted
with surprise by the Fordham faculty, which had endorsed Mr.
Taylor's moves to strengthen the school.
