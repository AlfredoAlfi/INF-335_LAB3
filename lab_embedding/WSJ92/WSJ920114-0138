Business Brief -- Wisconsin Energy Corp.:
   Federal Regulators Propose
   Fine of $150,000 for Unit
Since the early 1970s, plant employees "routinely used a
sledge hammer to jar the valves" if they didn't close during
the shutdowns, the NRC said. Additionally, personnel
neglected to fix the faulty valves, the regulators said.
   The valves are designed to stop radioactive gases from
flowing from the plant's reactor containment into its steam
turbine during certain emergency situations.
   Wisconsin Electric won't contest the proposed fine, said
Jim Zach, the company's vice president, nuclear power. "We've
developed a plan to correct the deficiencies," he said.
