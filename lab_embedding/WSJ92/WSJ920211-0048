   Reports 8.6% Increase
   In Fourth-Period Net
C.R. Shoemate, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the U.S. recession as well as "very difficult conditions" in
some Latin American countries "continued to constrain our
progress" in the quarter.
   In 1992, he said, he expects European business to continue
to show solid gains, Asian operations to show a higher growth
rate and growth to resume in the North American consumer
foods business. Latin American operations "will continue to
operate under difficult but manageable conditions," he said.
   For the year, net declined slightly to $372.7 million, or
$4.80 a share, from the year-earlier $373.9 million, or $4.83
a share. The 1991 figure included a $31.5 million loss from
discontinued operations, equal to 42 cents a share. Sales
rose 7.1% to $6.19 billion.
   In late trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
CPC shares were quoted at $84.875, up $1.25.
