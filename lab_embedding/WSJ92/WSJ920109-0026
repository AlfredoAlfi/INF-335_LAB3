   Jumped in Its Third Period

$20, up $3, in over-the-counter trading.
   Gerald J. Rubin, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company is projecting sales and earnings gains for

Sable line of hair-care appliances designed for
African-American customers. It also will begin sales in
Europe during 1992.
