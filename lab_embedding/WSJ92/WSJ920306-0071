Business Brief -- ITT Crp:
   Araskog Addresses Rumors
   About ITT Hartford Sale
Mr. Araskog started rumors swirling last week when he
hinted in an interview with the Financial Times that ITT was
more willing than before to consider selling or spinning off
divisions because "we want the company to be more exciting to
the investment community than it is."
   That comment gave a bounce to ITT's stock, which rose
again when earlier this week the company agreed to sell its
30% stake in Alcatel N.V., a French telecommunications maker,
to partner Alcatel Alsthom for $3.6 billion in cash and
stock.
   Yesterday, Mr. Araskog suggested that part of the proceeds
may be used for "some stock repurchase" but didn't elaborate.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
ITT closed at $66, down $2.75, in a generally weak market.
