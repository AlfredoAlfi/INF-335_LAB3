A spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association said all 100 member companies combined are
expected to spend $10.9 billion in 1992, compared with $9.6
billion in 1991.
   Merck's RD budget is the largest of U.S. companies, said
Christina Heuer, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham, but
it's a toss-up with Britain's Glaxo Holdings PLC, for the No.
1 spot in the world. Glaxo expects RD spending for the
fiscal year ending in June 1992 to top #600 million, or about
$1 billion. But Glaxo's spending is growing faster, Ms. Heuer
said. She projects RD spending by Glaxo will be #620
million, up 30% from fiscal 1991.
   Merck also prominently outlined its views on health-care
reform in its annual report. The company listed "principles
and responsibilities" it has adopted on the issue, which
include access for all Americans, an "outcomes-focused"
health-care system that improves quality of life, and a
system of rational cost management, which does not compromise
access, quality and good medical practice.
   Fearing the discussion will focus too much on cost, the
company intends to work with members of Congress, industry
and consumer groups, and perhaps other pharmaceutical
companies to make sure the debate includes consideration of
quality and access as well, said Dr. Stephen Keith, senior
director of public policy at Merck.
   Merck hasn't formulated a specific opinion or position on
any one proposal yet, but might in the future, he added.
