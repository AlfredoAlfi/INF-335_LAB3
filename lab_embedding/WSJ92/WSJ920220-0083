Marketing  Media:
   DGL Agrees to Distribute
   Shevardnadze Reports
DGL said it has the license to distribute the
twice-monthly report in all countries outside of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. The publisher expects to
begin selling the publication in the U.S. first, then in
Europe and Japan.
   Sergei Tarasenko, a member of the think tank board and Mr.
Shevardnadze's assistant, said DGL approached the group with
the idea for the report. "They made an interesting offer,"
Mr. Tarasenko said in a telephone interview. "We would like
to express our views and make them public and get an audience
for them, and this is one way to do that."
   The report, which will begin publication in March, will
contain analyses of business-venture opportunities, military
affairs, taxes and import-export laws, and other topics, said
Pamela Lush, president of DGL. The subscription list in the
U.S. will probably be limited to 25 to 40 companies, she
said.
   DGL is also the U.S. distributor of InterFax, the
independent news agency in the former Soviet Union.
