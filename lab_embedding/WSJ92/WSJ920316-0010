FASB Is Pressured
   To Drop or Delay
   Mark-to-Market Plan
Mr. Taylor said that if FASB does require the banks to
mark bonds and securities to current market prices, it should
also consider marking liabilities such as certificates of
deposit and the bank's own debt to market prices. And he
called for stricter enforcement of current accounting rules
that require marking to market securities held for sale
rather than investment.
   Dennis Beresford, FASB chairman, said that the FASB would
discuss the marketvalue proposal March 25 and would consider
marking liabilities as well as assets to market. Timothy
Lucas, FASB research director, said the FASB will also
consider booking gains or losses from selling securities to
the equity side of the balance sheet rather than affecting
profits as initially proposed by the FASB.
   Walter Schuetze, chief accountant of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said that despite the reservations of
the FDIC, the SEC still feels that the FASB should proceed
with the market-value proposal. He said he expects the FASB
to issue the proposal as a rule by mid-1993 after a
three-month exposure period and hearings.
