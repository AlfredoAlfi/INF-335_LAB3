Perelman Plans to Sell
   National Health Labs'
   Shares for $357 Million
All of the shares will be offered by National Health Care
Group Inc., a wholly owned unit of Mr. Perelman's MacAndrews
 Forbes Holdings Inc., which currently owns about 37% of
National Health Labs. The offering would reduce Mr.
Perelman's stake in National Health Labs to about 20%.
National Health Labs won't receive any proceeds from the
offering, which will be made both domestically and
internationally.
   Mr. Perelman, who serves as National Health Labs'
chairman, has been selling assets, partly to reduce debt, for
nearly a year. Last year he sold two pieces of Revlon Inc.
for $1.14 billion, 40% of National Health Labs for $750
million, and 40% of Marvel Entertainment Inc., the comic book
marketer, for $79 million. He has since sold another $150
million in Revlon assets, and has announced plans to sell 15%
of Coleman Co., the outdoor equipment maker, for $72 million.
   National Health Labs said last month it expects to report
1991 net of $104 million, or $1.05 a share, up 26% from $82.6
million, or 83 cents a share, in 1990. The company said
unaudited 1991 sales were $603 million, compared with $501.9
million in 1990.
