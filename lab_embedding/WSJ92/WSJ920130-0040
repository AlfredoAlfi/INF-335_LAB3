Business Brief -- Bow Valley Industries Ltd.:
   Firm Takes Write-Down,
   Expects to Post 1991 Loss
Bow Valley said that about C$180 million of the write-down
is related directly to low commodity prices, while C$50
million is accounted for by revisions to its reserves of oil
and gas. The remainder represents a C$20 million write-down
of its Whiterose property, off Canada's eastern coast, and
unsuccessful exploration projects.
   The company said it expects to release its 1991 results
around Feb. 14. It said the write-downs, which industry
analysts had expected, will have a positive effect on the
company's future net income and return on capital, due to
lower depreciation and depletion charges.
   In 1990, Bow Valley had net of C$49.7 million, or 47 cents
a share. Company officials had said earlier that they didn't
expect 1991 results to match those of 1990. Bow Valley is an
oil and gas production and exploration concern.
