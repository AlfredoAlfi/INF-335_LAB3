Clinton Dismisses Questions
   About His Draft Record
The Journal's story yesterday provided new information
showing that during a critical two-month period in 1969, Mr.
Clinton had a draft deferment that was reserved for people
who had joined an ROTC program -- even though he never
actually joined such a program. The story also quoted retired
Col. Eugene Holmes, the ROTC recruiter, as saying that Mr.
Clinton "was able to manipulate things so that he didn't have
to go in."
   Yesterday, Mr. Clinton said that he didn't purposefully
manipulate the system to avoid the draft and that he
eventually backed out of the deferment and subjected himself
to the draft -- a fact included in the Journal's story.
   In New Hampshire, Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, who won the
congressional medal of honor in Vietnam, said: "If you ask me
whether the jury is still out as to whether Gov. Clinton has
misrepresented his actions, I would say that the answer is
`yes.'" Kerrey aides said he plans to make similar allusions
and also campaign in New Hampshire with fellow Vietnam
veterans who served with him in the elite Navy SEALs.
