Business Brief -- Bass PLC:
   Suit Against Promus Claims
   Fraud in Holiday Inn Sale
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New York,
Bass alleges that Promus misled it about the condition of
many of the Holiday Inn hotels, their compliance with various
laws such as zoning ordinances, and the nature of their
leases. Bass also alleges that Holiday Inn has millions of
dollars in potential liabilities that Bass was unaware of at
the time of the purchase. The nature of the liabilities was
not disclosed in the lawsuit and a lawyer for Bass declined
to comment on the case. Bass also alleges that Promus is not
living up to the terms of a tax-sharing agreement concerning
pre-acquisition taxes on Holiday Inn hotels.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages and a court order
requiring Promus to meet the terms of the purchase agreement.
A spokesman for Promus said the company does not discuss
pending litigation.
