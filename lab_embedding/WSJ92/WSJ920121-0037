Business Brief -- Borland International Inc.:
   Company's Profit Rose 10%
   For Its Fiscal Third Quarter
Revenue dropped 6.5% to $115 million from $123 million.
   The results included a pretax restructuring charge of $6
million and a tax benefit of $7 million, both related to the
completion of the Ashton-Tate purchase.
   In over-the-counter trading, the company's stock closed at
$72, down $3.25.
   The stock's decline reflected a weakness in many software
company stocks, said analyst Timothy McCollum of Dean Witter
Reynolds, noting that Borland's earnings generally met
expectations. The company's performance should improve by the
summer as Borland introduces new products, he said.
