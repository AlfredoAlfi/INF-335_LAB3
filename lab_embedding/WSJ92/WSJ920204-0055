Business Brief -- Noble Drilling Corp.:
   Company Is Laying Off 200
   In Its Domestic Work Force
Domestic drilling has been depressed for a long period of
time with little improvement seen for the near term, said
James C. Day, president and chief executive officer of Noble.
The domestic service sector of the oil industry will continue
to contract and reserves will continue to decline until our
country develops a viable national energy policy, he said.
