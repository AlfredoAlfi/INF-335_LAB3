Canada to Discourage
   Crossborder Shopping
   In U.S. by Its Citizens
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney disclosed his government's
intention to deal with the issue following a meeting
yesterday with provincial government leaders. Canadian
retailers have been demanding that government action be taken
to stem crossborder shopping by Canadians, which has been a
boon to stores in communities such as Buffalo, N.Y., and
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
