FDIC Tentatively Backs
   Terms of Milken Settlement
It wasn't made public what conditions the board wants to
impose, but people familiar with the talks said the board is
concerned that the agreement might influence a government
decision on whether Mr. Milken must pay taxes on the
securities he sells to raise money for the settlement, and to
what extent Mr. Milken's co-defendants, including his
brother, are parties to the deal.
   The FDIC alleges that Mr. Milken, former head of the
junk-bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., caused
billions of dollars in losses at government-insured SLs. The
government is seeking compensation.
   Yesterday, Mr. Milken agreed to delay voting on Drexel's
bankruptcy-reorganization plan. The voting by other creditors
is said to be overwhelmingly in favor of the plan. Mr.
Milken's agreement to put off his vote appears to be a sign
that he is confident that the settlement of suits filed
against him by Drexel, thrift regulators and allegedly
defrauded investors will be approved.
