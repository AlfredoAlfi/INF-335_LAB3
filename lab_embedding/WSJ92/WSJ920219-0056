   Computer-Reselling Stores
   To Be Sold to Future Now
Future Now's shares rose sharply on the news, closing at
$18.50, up $3.25, in national over-the-counter trading.
Shares of Intelligent Electronics gained 75 cents to $28.25
in over-the-counter trading.
   The acquisition would vault Cincinnati-based Future Now
into the ranks of the nation's top 10 computer resellers,
with pro forma 1991 sales volume of approximately $350
million. Future Now is currently the largest of Intelligent
Electronics' approximately 1,500 franchisees. For Intelligent
Electronics, the sale is part of the Exton, Pa., concern's
strategy to focus on computer reselling through franchises
and on retailing computers through its office-products super
stores.
   In a separate transaction, Intelligent Electronics is
negotiating to acquire substantially all of the assets of two
other unnamed computer resellers. If that deal is completed,
Future Now officials said they expect to acquire those assets
as well.
