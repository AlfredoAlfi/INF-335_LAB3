Business Brief -- WD-40 Co.:
   Company Is Ordered to Pay
   Terminated Sales Agencies
Chris Miller, who represented WD-40, said there is "the
probability of an appeal," following post-trial motions for
reduction of the award.
   The jury's award equals about twothirds of the company's
1991 net income of $15.3 million. The plaintiffs had
requested $18 million in compensatory damages, Mr. Shimko
said.
   WD-40, based in San Diego, makes lubricants and rust
preventatives. Its stock was quoted at $32, unchanged, in
late national over-the-counter trading.
