   Carolco Redeems
   Debt, Setting Stage
   For Restructuring
Two more major conditions must be met to complete the
restructuring, which involves a $45 million cash infusion by
the partners. A new contract must be written for Mario F.
Kassar, the company's chairman. And Live Entertainment Inc.'s
credit line must be extended to Nov. 30 to match the
borrowing capacity of Carolco. Carolco late last year tried
to acquire Live, a Los Angeles home video concern, and still
holds a 53% stake.
   Discussions also are continuing about the configuration of
the board, which will add three seats for partners Pioneer
Electronic Corp. of Japan; RCS Video International Services
B.V., an affiliate of Rizzoli Corriere della Sera Group; and
a unit of France's Canal S.A.
   After the redemption, which will cost Carolco about $28.1
million, the company will have about $15.6 million remaining
in an escrow account that it expects to be able to use for
operating purposes. Carolco is best-known for producing
big-budget "action" films such as "Terminator 2" and "Total
Recall."
