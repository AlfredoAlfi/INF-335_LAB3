Pepper...and Salt
Yearly reports Of companies show
   How they've flourished
   In photos that glow --
   Which colorful lure
   You might let slide
   If you didn't read
   The statistics inside.

   If you are let go,
   Don't feel disgraced --
   You've not been fired,
   You've been "outplaced."
   -- G. Sterling Leiby.
