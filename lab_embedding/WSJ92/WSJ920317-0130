American Air Says United
   Unfairly Controls O'Hare
The case, which will be decided by U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood, examines some of the most pressing questions of
the industry, such as how to maintain competition in the face
of restricted access to airport landing rights.
   In opening arguments before Judge Wood, American's lawyer,
Ira M. Millstein of the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal 
Manges, painted a picture of a United management actively
attempting to contain the growth of American at O'Hare. Mr.
Millstein also suggested that if American doesn't win the
lawsuit it will have to severely cut back its operations at
O'Hare, where it has invested nearly $5 billion.
   UAL lawyers countered that the lawsuit is just sour grapes
over not being able to acquire the jet slots for itself. They
also said that American is unfairly focusing on the Chicago
market when it ought to be looking at the competition between
the two on a larger scale.
