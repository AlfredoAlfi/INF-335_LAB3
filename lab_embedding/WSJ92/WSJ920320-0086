Bristol-Myers Squibb Sets Pact
A Bristol-Myers spokesman said the new confidential voting
procedures, which mandate that shareholders' proxy votes be
kept secret, will be instituted on May 5 at the company's
1992 annual meeting.
   The shareholder group asserts that confidentiality during
proxy contests helps keep management from pressuring
shareholders to vote a certain way.
