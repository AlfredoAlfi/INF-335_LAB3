Westwood, Officials
   Agree to Settlement
   Over Contributions
According to the FEC, the company's chairman, Norman
Pattiz, arranged for several of his fellow executives and
their relatives to make $1,000 contributions to Sen. Biden's
campaign, and that he later arranged for the company to
reimburse them through falsified expenses. Mr. Pattiz
admitted that he did arrange the reimbursements, but said he
didn't know that doing so was illegal, according to the
commission documents.
   In a series of agreements made public, the company and Mr.
Pattiz each consented to pay the Treasury $26,000 in civil
penalties. The company's president, William Battison, and a
vice president, Gary Yusko, each agreed to pay $8,000 to
settle the complaint, according to the FEC. Other officials
and their relatives also paid smaller penalties.
   The civil penalties in the case, which totaled $72,300,
were among the largest judgments ever obtained by the federal
election agency. The FEC found that there wasn't sufficient
evidence to indicate that the Biden campaign knew anything
about the improper contributions.
   A spokesman for Westwood One and the executives declined
to comment.
