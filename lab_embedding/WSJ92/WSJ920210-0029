Business Brief -- Autodesk Inc.:
   Shareholder Suit Charges
   Firm With Securities Fraud
The suit was filed by William Lerach, a San Diego attorney
with the firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie  Lerach, who
has in recent years filed numerous similar suits against
publicly traded companies that had precipitous stock
declines. Autodesk's general counsel, Sandra Marin, termed
the suit "repugnant" and "meritless" and said the company
would vigorously defend itself.
