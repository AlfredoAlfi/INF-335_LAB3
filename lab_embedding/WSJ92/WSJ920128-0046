International Brief -- National Westminster Bank PLC:
   Some Businesses Regrouped
   As NatWest Markets Unit
NatWest Markets will take charge of both the corporate and
treasury operations of NatWest's head office and the
securities trading and investment banking activities of
County NatWest Group, NatWest's merchant banking arm.
   County NatWest showed a loss of #53 million ($95.1
million) in 1990, its fifth annual loss in succession, and it
is expected to post a further small loss or at best
break-even results for 1991. A year ago, it was the object of
a sharply worded warning from NatWest's chairman, Lord
Alexander, to the effect that it could face closure if it
failed to provide a satisfactory return on equity.
