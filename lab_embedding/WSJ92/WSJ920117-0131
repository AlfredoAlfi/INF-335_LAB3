   Furriers' Cold Comfort
   Isn't Due to Activists
New York is the largest retail center for furs in the U.S.
It is also where the recession has taken its severest toll in
terms of jobs, particularly in the white-collar,
middle-management area of the private sector. Hence, the New
York area is the worst barometer if one wants to determine
what's ailing the fur business in the U.S.
