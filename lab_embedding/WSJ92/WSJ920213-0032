   A LEGAL BEAT item in Tuesday's edition misstated which
state courts have upheld the constitutionality of limits on
jury awards for "pain and suffering." Courts in Illinois,
Indiana, California and Florida have not upheld such caps.
Only Maryland and Kansas have upheld the jury award limits
for pain and suffering for all personal injury cases.
Florida, New Hampshire and Washington have rejected such
limits.

   FORD MOTOR Co. is cutting the incentives offered on
certain cars and trucks under a program that continues
through March 31. The discount on 1992 Mercury Grand Marquis
models, for example, will decrease to $500 from $1,000 under
the previous program. In last Thursday's edition, it was
incorrectly stated that Ford boosted its incentives.

Extended, Increased Through March 31" -- WSJ Feb. 6, 1992)
