Who's News:
   Norwood Is Selected
   As Managing Partner
   Of Crow Ventures
Partners in the Crow company recently rejected a proposal
for a total separation of Crow Ventures' operations from the
giant commercial real estate company. The affiliate had been
responsible for raising much of the capital used by the Crow
company for the acquisition and development of commercial
real estate projects.
   As the commercial real estate business dried up, Crow
Ventures concentrated on operating its two real estate
investment funds and other businesses. The funds, whose
investors include several large pension funds, acquired more
than $1 billion in real estate from 1987 to 1989.
   But Crow Ventures has been unable to expand other
businesses, primarily its real estate advisory services,
because loan defaults and renegotiations by the Crow company
have barred the affiliate from receiving contracts with
government agencies and some financial institutions.
   Mr. Whitman said he favored separating Crow Ventures from
the Crow company to allow the affiliate to expand those
businesses. He added that he is sympathetic to the partners'
position, and he and other Crow officials said the parting is
amicable.
