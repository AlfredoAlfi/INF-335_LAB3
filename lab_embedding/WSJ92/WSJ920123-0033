Los Angeles School Board
   Approves Condom Plan
The plan for the nation's second-largest city offers
parents the right to deny their children permission to obtain
condoms. Consent forms will be sent home with each student;
if parents fail to return the form, school officials will
assume that the student may receive condoms.
   The approval of the condom plan brought an end to more
than two years of study. The plan was one of 10
recommendations to expand AIDS education and prevention
efforts considered at the meeting. The board also approved
proposals to increase classroom time for AIDS education and
also to seek funding to expand student health services.
