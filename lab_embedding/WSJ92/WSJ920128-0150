International:
   Hong Kong Inflation Slows
In addition to lower oil and food prices, analysts assign
credit for slower inflation late last year partly to efforts
by the government and local banks to reduce speculation on
residential property.
   But many economists insist that the easing of inflation is
only temporary.
   "If the government does this year what they did last year
in the way of raising taxes, you'll see another sudden jump
in inflation," said Alan McLean, chief economist of Hongkong
 Shanghai Banking Corp.
