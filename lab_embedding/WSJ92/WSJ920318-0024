Business Brief:
   Optical Radiation
   Plans to Spin Off
   Consumer Group
"The spinoff will permit Optical Radiation to concentrate
more closely on the development of emerging medical
technologies to bring new ophthalmic surgical products and
procedures to the marketplace," said Richard D. Wood,
president.
   After the spinoff, Optical Radiation would consist of two
business units, a division that designs and makes intraocular
lenses for cataract surgery patients and a division that
makes systems and parts for the photolithographic, theater
and specialty lighting markets.
   The new company, which hasn't been named yet, would make
prescription eyewear, polycarbonate lens blanks and metallic
parts and optics for industrial customers. William T.
Sullivan, currently vice president of the Consumer Optical
Group, would become president and chief executive of the new
company.
   In over-the-counter trading, Optical Radiation stock rose
$1.375 to $29 a share yesterday, after dropping 62.5 cents
Monday. The spinoff plan was announced late in the trading
session Monday.
