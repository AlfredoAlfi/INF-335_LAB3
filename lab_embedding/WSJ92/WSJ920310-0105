   In February, IPS said it would take a charge of about $3
million for the third quarter ended Jan. 31, and was in
default under various leases with its major equipment
financing source.
   The company added that it owed about $500,000 in federal
payroll taxes, interest and penalties, and was negotiating to
restructure about $7 million in equipment-lease obligations.
Mr. Galligan said IPS was continuing to work on its financial
restructuring.
